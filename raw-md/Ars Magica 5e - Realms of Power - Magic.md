#### **Author Bios**

**Erik Dahl** is grateful to live in Davis, California with his dear and patient wife, who occasionally listens to him babble on about Ars Magica and did so several times during the writing of this book. He would like to dedicate his work on Magic to the Playstation 2 game Katamari Damacy, which (much like traveling through the Magic realm) is an exotic and strange but ultimately rewarding experience.

**Timothy Ferguson** wandered in briefly to write about cats, lounge around on the sofa, and knock things over. Really he was more trouble than he was worth, but he's cute, so what can you do?

**Richard Love** lives in New Zealand, which has sometimes been transformed into a magical place for film. He would like to thank his partner Paula for continuing to put up with his hobbies. He'd also like to thank Gladia, Verus, Ulrich and the other inhabitants of the Fons Albae chapter house for continuing to put up with Antaeus' unexplained sojourns into the forest and his occasional lack of pants.

**John Post** is an attorney who lives and works in a magical, fogshrouded city by a bay. His lovely wife often drags him out to enjoy the natural beauty that surrounds them in Northern California. The flora and fauna there provided inspiration for his small contribution to this book. He hopes his ideas can make the most basic of Ars Magica adventures — the vis hunt — slightly more magical.

**Mark Shirley's** biographies in Ars Magica books have become more interesting than his real life. Suffice it to say that his job and his home remain unchanged, although he is a little older and more grizzled.

**Andrew P. Smith** most closely resembles a Man of the Lake in his Summer season. He briefly emerged from the regio of Lake Constance to make a minor contribution to this worthy tome.

**Sheila Thomas** lives near Cambridge, England with her gorgeous cat Elliott (his Powers include Aura of Rightful Authority, Feline Lullaby, and Incredibly Cute) without whose involvement the work would have proceeded much more smoothly. Her local aura promotes overwork. Sheila dedicates this book to her niece, Laura Sugrue, who will understand and use the contents.

## *Chapter One*

# *Introduction*

The book you now hold in your hands might be described by the magi of Mythic Europe as a great compendium of supernatural knowledge and wisdom — a book that describes the true nature of the Magic realm, and that outlines for the first time many of the fundamental concepts of the world of **Ars Magica**. Within its living pages you will experience the full majesty of the medieval setting at its most ideal, as Magic causes all things to become everything they could be — or should be. Here, Magic makes the lowly serpent into a fearsome dragon, it turns a tranquil clearing into a place of breathtaking beauty, and it transforms an ordinary and mundane person into a mighty wizard.

This book has been divided into two parts. The first part, **Places of Magic**, covers Magic tied to a physical location, including auras, regiones, vis, and the Magic Realm itself. This type of Magic is the most common sort experienced by people in Mythic Europe. The second part of the book, **Beings of Magic**, describes how players can incorporate the realm of Magic into their characters through magical influence, new Virtues and Flaws, Magic Abilities, and even ways to play magical beings as characters. It contains examples of characters that have been changed by Magic, or that have left the Magic Realm and come to manifest in the world outside of its boundaries.

## *What is Magic?*

Of all the supernatural realms of power in **Ars Magica**, Magic is likely to be the one that characters will encounter most often, as covenants are usually located within Magic auras, and all Hermetic magi are aligned to the Magic realm. Yet unlike the power of the Divine or the Infernal, Magic is not associated with what people do, so much as it is a part of what they are. Theoretically, any person can become more Divine or more Infernal simply by behaving more or less virtuously, but to become Magical, the character must essentially change. Magic is in the blood, so to speak; it is part of the character's fundamental nature.

Magical beings are simply better than mundane beings; and in this case "better than" means "idealized versions of." Magical beings are closer to perfection. This is not always superior or desirable, since something can be a perfect failure or a perfect disaster. However, to measure how magical a thing is,

![](_page_4_Picture_9.jpeg)

![](_page_4_Picture_10.jpeg)

a good method is to examine how closely it conforms to an ideal. For example, a magical wolf is even more like the ideal wolf than a mundane wolf, in that it has qualities that make it better at being a wolf, and inferiorities that make it worse at being anything other than a wolf.

To help players describe things that are more or less part of the Magic realm, here are three facts about Magic. Note that these facts are not necessarily known to all characters who are somehow aligned with Magic, including magi; only those who have at least a rudimentary knowledge of Magic Lore will be able to recognize them. These facts also relate back to how Magic is ideal, to make it easier to come up with ways that magical power can manifest.

**Magic is objective.** The realm of Magic does not change depending upon the observer, but rather acts as a constant and measurable influence. In the Magic Realm, reality is fixed, and a thing is what it is, though by the power of the realm it may become more or less so. However, Magic cannot change what something is at its most basic level; Magic cannot modify a thing's essential nature. In its most idealized form, a Magic being is nothing but its essential qualities; and so in this respect the realm of Magic can be seen as a great pattern upon which all the more common, less perfect things of the mundane realm are based.

**Magic is ancient.** The longer something has been magical, the more powerful it is. Thus, the most powerful magical beings have been around for thousands of years. This does not mean that newer things cannot be magical, or even that they cannot be as powerful as ancient magical things, only that as time passes, Magic makes things more magical. In a sense, time is an idealizing force of Magic, so that the most magical thing is usually the oldest version of that thing. Magic auras and the Magic Realm embody this quality of Magic especially well, as a force of change upon mundane things and a supernatural record of their existence.

**Magic is mysterious.** Like fate, death, love, or tomorrow's weather, Magic is unpredictable and strange. Unlike the power of the Divine or the Infernal, there seems to be no single guiding hand behind Magic, but rather a multitude of independent spirits and magical beings that act upon the mundane world and turn it towards their own ends. In the same way that no one knows what causes The Gift or a particular Virtue or Flaw to manifest, no one knows the true purpose of the Magic realm — and the less people know, the more powerful it is. For this reason, beings of Magic typically prefer secrecy and isolation.

According to these definitions, the most magical beings would have nothing but essential qualities, would be as old as creation, and would be almost entirely withdrawn from mundane society.

## *Magic and Other Realms*

Magic primarily influences the mundane realm by making it more magical. That is, it brings about the ideal, whether by making certain qualities essential and removing qualities that are not essential, by preserving the magic of ancient places and beings, or by causing them to become more distant and withdrawn. Magic constantly improves upon nature as a supernatural force for change. It is powerful and consistent. When Magic acts upon other realms, however, or when beings of other realms interact with the Magic realm, the results are far less predictable.

#### **Magic and the Divine**

Most holy characters and Divine beings do not recognize Magic as a separate supernatural realm, treating it either as an expression of God's gifts if used virtuously, or a tool of the Devil when used sinfully. Magical beings are seen as part of nature, and described as either blessed creatures if they serve God's will, or corrupted beasts if they act against him. Magical power is lessened in the Dominion, and many magi believe this is because the power of the Divine is even more perfect than that of Magic.

![](_page_5_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Magic and the Infernal**

Magic is easily assimilated with the powers of the Infernal, though magical characters might wish this was not so, as the Infernal realm can consume and corrupt anything it touches. The power of nature can be turned to evil in the same way that it can be used for good. Demons often masquerade as magical beings, especially ghosts and spirits, but while many magical characters do not serve the Divine, they usually oppose the Infernal. When Magic resists giving over to the power of that realm, however, it is less potent fortunately demons are hindered in Magic places as well.

#### **Magic and Faerie**

Magic and Faerie both complement and act against each other. Magic is generally associated with objective reality, while Faerie is typically concerned with subjective reality. Magic is rooted in the past and evolves over time, striving towards perfection, while Faerie almost constantly changes and yet rarely matures. Where Magic prefers to be left alone by society and cloaks itself in secrecy, Faerie is primarily interested in interaction with humanity and seeks out company whenever possible. Magic and Faerie are opposites in as much as what they desire from the world is completely different.

On the other hand, both realms are often concerned with nature and what things are instead of what they do. Many have theorized that magical and faerie creatures could have a more direct relationship — that in the past they would easily cross over from one realm to the other, or that they both once belonged to a single realm of power that split into two. Many races that exist in the Magic realm may also be found in the Faerie realm, for example. Thus, while Magic and Faerie are often opposed, they also tend to have more in common with each other than with either of the other supernatural realms.

## *Chapter Two*

# *Magic Auras*

A location with a Magic aura is one where things are in some way superior to normal, or more real, as described in **ArM5**, page 184. The extent of this difference depends on the strength of the aura and, even at moderate levels, may not be immediately obvious. Most commonly, the air is clearer, colors more vivid, sounds more piercing, vegetation more lush. All Magic auras have an effect on the use of Hermetic magic and other displays of supernatural power according to the rules in **ArM5,** page 183. Auras of level six and above cause Warping according to the rules in **ArM5**, pages 167-168.

Magi have long debated the exact nature of these Magic auras in which their covenants are located. Most agree that in such areas, the boundary between the earthly world and the Magic Realm is weaker, allowing some measure of the magical energy of that pure realm to leak through and infuse the region under the aura's influence. It is commonly accepted that this constituent magical energy takes the form of "fluid vis," although opinions differ as to the exact nature of this phenomenon. While this fluid vis is present everywhere, it flows into and is attracted to magical areas, and pools and concentrates there, forming an aura of power.

## *Theories Concerning Magic Auras*

Auras of supernatural power fall under the purview of the Hermetic Art of Vim, but the Hermetic theory and understanding of this subject is incomplete. Many Intellego Vim spells for auras work reliably, but magics which attempt to effect a change in an aura are often ineffective or unpredictable. Some magi have even died or entered Final Twilight during an attempt to increase the aura of their covenant. This lack of completeness in the theory is due in part to a lack of agreement among magi. There are two main areas in which opinions differ. Firstly, there is the philosophical question of what exactly the "fluid vis" is, and where (or what) it originates from. Secondly, there is the somewhat more practical issue of exactly how the activities of magi influence Magic auras.

On the first question, some magi prefer to label the magical energy as "radiant vis," broadly equating it to the "aether," Aristotle's fifth element — the celestial fire that exists beyond the Lunar Sphere. Others still like to call it "tellurian vis," implying that the earth itself is the wellspring of magic. Whichever the label that is chosen, it seems clear that fluid vis forms the "fuel" for magical spellcasting — the more fluid vis that is present, the stronger magics will be. Under this theory, raw vis is simply a manifestation of the fluid vis that is highly concentrated into a physical form. When it is expended in spellcasting, for example, this fluid vis is released. As some magi have pointed out, this theory is not completely perfect, since fluidity (the quality of moisture) is antithetical to the rigidity of the dry quality, according to Aristotlean elemental theory. It has been noticed that some sources of vis that are located in Magic auras do not always yield the same number of pawns of vis. Some Hermetic theorists reckon that the size of the harvest may be a reflection of the health of the aura; that the fluid vis feeds the growth of vis in the same way as a nutrient feeds a plant.

On the second matter, most magi believe — perhaps arrogantly — that their own practice of magic, such as performing labwork, has a beneficial effect on a Magic aura, theorizing that the mere repeated use of magic in an area will tend to cause fluid vis to pool. (Most magi equate benefit with strengthening, since stronger Magic auras are generally desirable to them.) Some hold that simply contemplating magic (such as during study) will enhance the latent strength of an aura. Most believe that potent magical accidents tend to strengthen Magic auras, and with good reason, since there were several times in the Order's history, especially during the Schism War, when this phenomenon was observed. However, there is at least one recorded instance of a Perdo Vim botch stunting an aura. There is one single magical activity, vis extraction, that is generally agreed to weaken a Magic aura, since it supposedly removes, converts, and concentrates some of the fluid vis into raw vis. A contrary theory, which uses the analogy of water in a pool for fluid vis in an aura, holds that vis extraction is actually beneficial, deepening the "pool" in much the same way that dredging a river channel will deepen it.

Most magi are generally unaware of the precise impact their activities have on the Magic aura of their covenant, although these processes are at least partially understood by those who are well versed in the Art of Vim and who have undertaken a study of the subject. The functioning of auras is certainly a fertile area for research. Any effect that *reliably* manipulates a Magic aura should probably require at least a Major breakthrough or a Mystery Initiation.

The rules for aura variation in this chapter presuppose that the mainstream viewpoints are correct (for example, vis extraction has a detrimental effect on an aura). You may wish to change some of the numbers around if Magic auras behave differently in your saga.

![](_page_6_Picture_14.jpeg)

## *Tethers*

A tether is a particular object or circumstance of magical significance that acts like a magnet to the fluid vis, causing it to concentrate and pool around it to form a Magic aura. Nearly all Magic auras have a tether as their basis and center.

Tethers may either be natural, consisting of earthly or astrological features that are inherent to a place such as a mountain peak or solar alignment, or preternatural, built by wizards or arising from other magical entities. Each individual natural tether has a score of 1 or 2; a preternatural tether may have a score between 1 (for the weakest) and 5 (for the strongest).

If there is one tether present, then the base aura score is simply equal to the tether score. If multiple tethers are present, then the base aura score is determined as the natural aura score plus the preternatural aura sum of all natural tethers; it cannot exceed 5. The preternatural aura score is equal to the strongest preternatural tether, plus one for each additional tether. Likewise, it cannot exceed 5. A base aura score of greater than 5 thus always results from a combination of natural and preternatural tethers. Most such auras are legendary and those stronger still are extremely hard to reach, and dangerous to set foot in. If there are no tethers, the base aura score is 0.

Absent any other influence, the tether(s) normally generate a Magic aura of the same strength as the base aura score. However, the actions of magi and the influence of other auras may cause the current aura score to deviate from the base score at any given time (see Aura Variation Rules, below).

**Base Aura Score** = natural aura score + preternatural aura score

![](_page_7_Picture_8.jpeg)

![](_page_7_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Natural Aura Score** (maximum 5) = sum of all natural tethers

**Preternatural Aura Score** (maximum 5) = strongest preternatural tether + 1 per additional tether

## *Natural Tethers*

Particularly perfect or magnificent examples of natural features are quite often associated with low-level Magic auras and are the most common type of tether. Other aspects of the natural environment that can cause or enhance Magic auras are solar or astrological alignments, prevailing or perpetual weather conditions, perfect shapes, and antiquity.

Magi have undertaken research to try and establish whether it is the aura that brings about perfection in the landscape or the natural features that cause the aura; results are inconclusive. Stronger auras occur when natural tethers combine; for example, in an area of outstanding natural beauty that is also astrologically favorable.

The examples below describe only places with an aura up to a maximum score of 2, because individual perfect natural features have never been known to demonstrate a stronger aura. As noted above, combinations of such features can produce auras of up to 5 (see the insert on multiple tethers for examples). Some of the stronger auras might be aligned with Arts (see below). The following are just examples; it is certain that auras centered on other special natural features exist, also. Additional possibilities include valleys, cliffs, gorges, massifs, deserts, oases, springs, hills, islands, and so on.

#### **Caves**

**Tether 1:** A magnificent cavern displaying many natural pillars, stalagmites, stalactites, and other wondrous rock formations. A cave with walls and ceiling encrusted with crystals.

**Tether 2:** A group of magnificent caverns linked by arches, tunnels, and shafts. Extensive caverns with some tunnels that lead down a long way towards the center of the Earth.

As a result of Warping, inhabitants become accustomed to the enclosed environment and low light levels. Suitable Minor Flaws are Sensitive Sight (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Flaws), a Fear of open spaces, or Disfigured due to unnaturally pallid skin or strange-looking eyes adjusted to poor illumination.

![](_page_7_Picture_20.jpeg)

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Forest**

**Tether 1:** An ancient copse containing a few trees over seven hundred years old. An old forest with hardly a trace of human interference where the vegetation is lush; flowers, fruit, and fungi are larger than normal; insects, birds, and animals are a little larger and more healthy.

**Tether 2:** Ancient forest, verdant and undisturbed, where flowers, fruit, and fungi are perfectly shaped and animals are noticeably larger than usual.

As a result of Warping, inhabitants become attuned to the environment. Suitable Minor Flaws are a Fear of open spaces or Oversensitive to damage to vegetation. An Animal Companion might be acquired. A suitable Virtue could be Animal Ken or Wilderness Sense.

#### **Ice**

**Tether 1:** A perfectly shaped pyramidal mountain peak where the snow and ice retreat for just a few months in summer. A remote ice-bound valley surrounded by bare rocky summits.

**Tether 2:** A cave in a crystal-clear glacier flowing from a pristine, angular mountain peak. A landscape made entirely of ice, fantastically sculpted by nature, which never melts.

As a result of Warping, inhabitants become inured to the freezing temperature and brightness of sun on snow. Suitable Minor Flaws are Sensitive to Heat and Weak Sight (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Flaws), or possibly a Fear of vivid colors.

Such an aura may also be found among the ice floes of the distant north, if the tales are to be believed.

#### **Volcanic**

**Tether 1:** A perfectly shaped, smoking volcanic cone that periodically emits ash and lava, sufficient to be spectacular but rarely catastrophic. An expanse of boiling mud and sulfurous pools.

**Tether 2:** A vigorous and dangerous volcano that is most active at the turn of the seasons. A powerful, boiling hot geyser that spouts every seven hours.

As a result of Warping, inhabitants become immune to sulfur in the air and water and can tolerate high temperatures. Suitable Minor Flaws are Weak Sense of Taste or Weak Sense of Smell, and Sensitive to Cold

## *Examples of Auras with Multiple Tethers*

**Base Aura Score 3:** A very high waterfall broken into multiple white braids as it tumbles down over rocks, spray flying (natural tether 1), which always catches the morning sun and throws arcs of rainbow light all around (natural tether 1) before tumbling with a thunderous roar into a very deep pool (natural tether 1).

**Base Aura Score 3:** An underwater location with several strong currents (natural tether 1) where water elementals are at home (preternatural tether 2). This aura is likely to be aligned with Aquam.

**Base Aura Score 5:** Labyrinthine cave complexes (natural tether 2) where dragons or other magical creatures have dwelt for millennia (preternatural tether 1). At least one dragon still considers this to be home (preternatural tether 2). This aura might be aligned with Terram.

**Base Aura Score 5:** A primeval forest untouched by man (natural tether 2), where some trees are semi-sentient and mobile (preternatural tether 2), and dryads tend the non-sentient trees (preternatural tether 2); not a safe, tame place at all. This aura might be aligned with Herbam or Animal.

**Base Aura Score 6:** A thermally active site (natural tether 1) over the place where, at depth, fire elementals dwell (preternatural tether 2) with fire-breathing dragons (preternatural tether 4). This aura is highly likely to be aligned with Ignem.

**Base Aura Score 6:** The covenant of Durenmar, the domus magna of House Bonisagus, is located in a picturesque valley (natural tether 1) and has numerous strong preternatural tethers from its monuments and magic residues (maximum possible preternatural aura score of 5). Durenmar's current aura score is 7, and has been for many years, due to the regular magical activities of its magi.

**Base Aura Score 7:** A perfectly-shaped mountain peak (natural tether 1) where the rising and setting sun at the solstices tracks the edges of some of the arêtes (natural tether 2), and where crystal-clear ice and pure white snow lie all year round (natural tether 2); it is the home of frost giants (preternatural tether 2). This aura might be aligned with Ignem or Aquam.

**Base Aura Score 7:** A cloud heaped up into the rough shape of a palace (natural tether 2), which is periodically torn to bits by a hurricane after which it reforms differently (natural tether 2); air elementals are at home here (preternatural tether 2) and winds are particularly strong here at the equinoxes (natural tether 1). This aura is highly likely to be aligned with Auram.

(see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Flaws). The obvious suitable Minor Virtue is an appropriate Lesser Immunity.

#### **Water**

**Tether 1:** Gentle rain falls almost constantly except when there is mist. There is very little ground that is not covered in water. A particularly beautiful or powerful waterfall.

**Tether 2:** Rain falls continuously, often heavily, or there is always a thick fog. Inside a large waterfall or deep under the surface of a lake.

As a result of Warping, inhabitants adapt to see clearly through the fog and are not bothered by the precipitation. Suitable Minor Flaws are Sensitive Sight (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Flaws), a Weakness for natural bodies of water, and Disfigured on account of webbing between the digits or skin that cracks and flakes if not permanently wet. A suitable Virtue might be Dowsing, or Great Immunity: Drowning.

#### **Wind**

**Tether 1:** Wind blows continuously, never dropping below a lively breeze whatever the weather nearby, and attractive or curiously shaped clouds swarm across the sky. Wind swirls constantly about a small permanent tornado; clouds are twisted into spiraling forms.

**Tether 2:** A gale blows much of the time, often tossing towering dark clouds; storms rage in their upper levels.

As a result of Warping, inhabitants become inured to the constant wind and adapt to catch sounds and scents even when upwind. Suitable Minor Flaws are Sensitive Hearing or Sensitive Smell (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Flaws), or the ability to see Visions in cloud shapes.

## *Preternatural Tethers*

A preternatural tether is simply one that does not have a natural origin, but is caused by mortals, magic beings, or vis. Individual tethers may have a score up to 5, and combinations of such tethers may produce a preternatural aura score of up to 5, as described above. Such tethers usually come in one of the following types: magic monuments, magic residues, magic beings, or vis sources.

#### **Magic Monuments**

Ancient buildings or constructs that are strongly associated with Magic might constitute a tether. Examples include temples, menhirs, stone circles, pyramids, cave paintings, and parts of ancient covenants. As a rule of thumb, these places can be given one point of tether score for every full century that they have seen active use. For example, a standing stone at the covenant of Durenmar, which has been used for more than four centuries, has a tether score of 4.

#### **Magic Residues**

Places that have borne witness to extremely powerful or legendary magics may constitute a tether, if the magics have left a permanent imprint. Such sites are usually associated with a particular event. It is suggested that these places can be given a tether score equal to (Ritual spell level equivalent of magics - 40) / 10, rounded down. For example, the site of a casting of the 75thlevel spell *Shadow of Life Renewed* might have a tether score of 3.

#### **Magic Beings**

Some kinds of magical beings, which may be animals, plants, ghosts, elementals, and so on, form tethers. Any place that they currently inhabit, and which they have inhabited for at least a year, has a tether score equal to (being's Might / 10), rounded down. For example, a cave inhabited by a dragon with a Might score of 40 has a tether score of 4. If such a being moves away or is destroyed, the tether score drops by one point for every year until it vanishes. The site of the death or burial of a magical being, or a place where a magical being spent at least half its life, has a permanent tether equal to (being's Might / 20), rounded down. Other kinds of magical beings do not generate an aura, but are often instead dependent on some other Magic aura (such as that arising at a monument) for their abode.

#### **Vis Sources**

Places where raw vis manifests may also form a tether for a Magic aura, especially if the vis harvest is large. Whether the aura causes the vis to manifest, or vice versa, is a subject for some debate, although most magi think that a harvest of vis is a by-product of an aura, not a cause of an aura. As a rule of thumb, a source of vis not already in the presence of a tether may be given a tether score equal to (pawns harvested per year / 3), rounding down. For example, a source of vis yielding six pawns may have a tether score of 2.

## *Yearly Aura Modifier*

At the end of each year, the yearly aura modifier is the sum of all relevant effects from the table below. It cannot exceed +9 or be less than –9.

If the Magic aura fluctuates with respect to time (for example, changing in strength between day and night, or from season to season), treat the base aura score as that which occurs most frequently, and use this value for comparison. If two strengths occur with equal frequency, take the lower of the two. If there is a regio, the aura score is the aura strength at the top level.

## *Aura Variation Rules*

The strength of a Magic aura is not always the same as its base aura score; in particular, weak Magic auras can even arise without a tether, although such auras are somewhat rare and usually short lived. The actions of magi (and other wizards) and the presence of a foreign aura that impinges on the aura may cause its score to become either higher or lower than the base aura score.

Most forms of magical activity tend to add to the reserve of fluid vis and thus strengthen an aura, except for vis extraction, which removes fluid vis from an aura's reserve, and tends to weaken it. The expenditure of raw vis in the aura converts it into new fluid vis and thus adds to the aura. For example, the casting of Ritual spells such as *Aegis of the Hearth*, the use of vis in certamen, and study from vis all add to the fluid vis reserve. However, using vis to enchant an item, attune a familiar, or create a Longevity Ritual does not count; in these cases the vis is not released, but is instead concentrated into a mobile entity (an item, beast, or person, respectively) that is not attached to the aura, and which may leave it.

Impinging foreign auras tend to influence a Magic aura in a manner consistent with the interaction of the realms (see the

![](_page_9_Picture_21.jpeg)

![](_page_10_Picture_1.jpeg)

Realm Interaction Table in **ArM5**, page 183). That is to say, Magic and Faerie auras have a beneficial effect, whereas Divine and Infernal auras have a detrimental effect. An "impinging" aura may be either one that occupies the same space, or a neighboring one that brushes up against the Magic aura.

In order to determine any possible changes in a Magic aura, you may calculate its yearly aura modifier (see insert). This number is separate from and should not be confused with the aura score. If the yearly aura modifier is between –3 and +3, then do nothing — in this case there are no strong prevailing effects and the aura remains stable. If the yearly aura modifier is +4 or greater, consult the Aura Strengthening Table (see insert). If it is –4 or less, consult the Aura Weakening Table (see insert). The base number of botch dice for rolls on either table is zero. However, every roll made on either table that results in a 9 or more causes the number of botch dice for subsequent rolls to increase by one; a year in which no roll at all is made causes the number of botch dice to decrease by one. These effects are cumulative. For example, after four successive years of aura-strengthening outcomes, the number of botch dice is four. After an unexceptional year with a yearly aura modifier of 0, say, the number of botch dice drops back to three. Repeated fluctuations and instabilities in an aura thus mean that a fracturing into a regio (which occurs on a botch) becomes increasingly likely.

An extremely potent magical botch may also trigger an immediate roll on either the Aura Strengthening or Aura Weakening Tables. Magical botches of moderate severity, resulting in a gain of 2 or more Warping Points, will affect the yearly aura modifier in an unpredictable fashion. The majority of such botches add to the fluid vis reserve and are beneficial to an aura, but some — most usually botches with the Art of Perdo — inadvertently destroy fluid vis and are detrimental.

You may wish to monitor the player covenant's aura, as well as any other important auras that the characters frequently encounter. You will probably not want to monitor any other Magic auras in your saga, such as those of other covenants. Mostly, the aura of a covenant should be fairly stable, with the yearly aura modifier sure to be between –3 and +3. In such years, there is no need to calculate the modifier. Even abnormal yearly aura modifiers will only cause an occasional change in aura strength, usually as a result of major events in the saga or perhaps due to deliberate efforts by magi.

Roll a stress die and add the yearly aura modifier, or choose a suitable outcome. Unless otherwise stated each outcome is temporary, and lasts for at most one year. If there is a regio, increases in aura strength apply only to the top level.

#### **Total: Botch**

Regio level appears: The area in which the aura is located becomes a regio, if it was not one previously, with a mundane level and a top level whose aura is the same as the overall aura score. If there is already a regio, then a new level appears. Everyone present in the aura receives 3 Warping Points. Regiones can appear either benignly or in a troublesome fashion (see below).

**Total: 0 – 6** No change to aura.

#### **Total: 7+**

Symptoms of aura strengthening noticed: See the insert for some suggestions.

#### **Total: 9**

Latent aura strengthening: Add 3 to next year's aura modifier.

#### **Total: 10**

Spontaneous magic effects: Minor random magical effects spontaneously appear; any persons targeted by such effects gain a Warping Point. Spellcasting totals for spontaneous magic receive a bonus of up to +3.

#### **Total: 11**

Temporary aura increase: The aura score increases by 1 for one season.

#### **Total: 12**

Vis creation: 1 to 3 pawns of vis spontaneously manifest in the aura. Either the harvest of an existing source of vis is increased, or the vis appears somewhere else, typically growing or coalescing in some fashion, which may not necessarily be noticed. This effect is temporary, but the vis gained is real and permanent.

#### **Total: 13**

Patches of stronger aura: The aura strength increases by 1 in part of the aura, such as one chamber or laboratory, perhaps at the center of the aura. Any mundane resident in this part of the aura gains a Warping Point.

#### **Total: 14**

Aura expands (permanent): The aura expands outward by several yards, so that it covers more physical space.

#### **Total: 15 – 20**

Current aura score increases 1 (permanent).

#### **Total: 21+**

Re-roll twice on this table, treating any total of 21+ as a 20.

## *Aura Weakening Table*

Roll a stress die and add the yearly aura modifier (ignoring the minus sign), or choose a suitable outcome. Unless otherwise stated each outcome is temporary, and lasts for at most one year. If there is a regio, decreases in aura strength apply only to the top level.

#### **Total: Botch**

Regio level disappears: If there is a regio present, one of its levels disappears (see below). Everyone present in that level receives 3 Warping Points. If there is no regio then a new regio arises, but all the buildings and inhabitants in the area retreat into the magical level, leaving the mundane level deserted and bereft of any signs of magic. Everyone present in the aura receives 3 Warping Points.

**Total: 0 – 6** No change to aura.

#### **Total: 7+**

Symptoms of aura weakening noticed: See the insert for some suggestions.

#### **Total: 9**

Latent aura weakening: Subtract 3 from next year's aura modifier.

#### **Total: 10**

Spontaneous magic stifled: Spellcasting totals for spontaneous magic receive a penalty of up to -3.

#### **Total: 11**

Temporary aura decrease: The aura score decreases by 1 for one season.

#### **Total: 12**

Vis wasting: 1 to 3 pawns of vis in the aura expire and lose their magical power. Either the harvest of an existing source of vis is decreased, or vis stored anywhere in the aura expires, for example rotting, shrivelling, or drying up, which may not necessarily be noticed. This effect is temporary, but the loss of vis is real and permanent.

#### **Total: 13**

Patches of weaker aura: The aura strength decreases by 1 in part of the aura, such as one chamber or laboratory, perhaps at the edge of the aura.

#### **Total: 14**

Aura contracts (permanent): The aura contracts inward by several yards, so that it covers less physical space.

**Total: 15 – 20**

Current aura score decreases 1 (permanent).

#### **Total: 21+**

Re-roll twice on this table, treating any total of 21+ as a 20.

that benefit the aura are mostly canceled out by vis extraction. However, a covenant that relentlessly and greedily extracts vis may find its aura temporarily dropping in strength, whereas a vis-rich covenant that is profligate with Ritual magic might find its aura eventually increasing. Some old, autumn covenants have accumulated quite a strong Magic aura mostly from the activities of their magi alone, with only weak tethers.

## *Symptoms of Aura Variation*

This is a suggested list of phenomena that may be subtly influenced by a Magic aura. Changes in these factors may reflect a corresponding change in the aura strength. These effects can also be used as story seeds, either precipitating a story by themselves or as hints to other events.

#### **Magical Inhabitants**

If a Magic aura strengthens, resident magical creatures may be seen to be prospering. If there are no such creatures, they may arrive. If the aura weakens, such magical residents may suffer or decline, or they may decide to leave.

## **Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals**

The prosperity and condition of flora and fauna in and around the aura may reflect its strength. The sizes of flocks and harvests may increase if the aura strengthens, and animals and plants may become more perfect. Any other natural resources gathered in the aura — such as water from a spring or well, or gemstones from a mine — may also increase in size, number, or perfection. Such prosperity may be reversed in the case of a weakening aura.

#### **Weather and Air**

With a stronger aura, the weather tends to become more extreme and the air is often crisper or fresher, with a clean scent or tingle in the air. In a weaker aura, the weather may be drearier and more mundane, and the air more stale.

#### **Mood**

A stronger Magic aura tends to enhance the eccentricity and creativity of its inhabitants; for instance, artists may find themselves possessed of heightened inspiration. In a weaker aura, the inhabitants may find themselves more depressed, or that original thought is stultified.

#### **Sentience**

If a Magic aura becomes stronger, formerly dumb creatures and objects may develop sentience, intelligence, or the ability to speak. If the aura dwindles, however, such entities may find their wits dulled, or may fall silent.

## **Signs and Supernatural Abilities**

The strengthening of a Magic aura may be reflected by an increase in portents, visions, and dreams experienced and observed by the inhabitants. Or they may develop other strange new abilities. If an aura weakens, such occurrences become less frequent, signs become muddied, and eldritch talents are lost. As a rule of thumb, for every point by which the aura score increases, one inhabitant can be (unwittingly) given a new Supernatural Virtue, or a character with an existing Supernatural Ability may receive 20 experience points in that Ability. It is best to choose a character who has recently gained a Warping Score of 5 and who thus qualifies for a new Minor Virtue. This process can be reversed if the aura weakens; a character with a Supernatural Ability loses 20 experience points. If this takes the Ability score to zero, the ability can no longer be used.

## *Aura Variation Story Seeds*

#### **Creature Comforts**

The covenant's strengthening aura attracts a powerful magical creature, whose presence will be a boon for the covenant. However, it will need to be accommodated in a lair and it comes with certain unsavoury habits, which may dismay the locals.

#### **The Squandered Source**

The covenant's weakening aura causes a magical creature, whose presence is welcomed on account of the vis it produces, to leave in search of a stronger Magic aura. Unless the magi can persuade it to stay or restore their aura, they will lose a source of vis.

#### **A Mundane Mood**

A bad mood and poor work ethic is noticed among the covenfolk. The magi suspect a sinister influence, but the true cause, which they have overlooked, is simply their slowly weakening aura and the increasing mundanity that results.

#### **Wizards' Windfall**

One of the covenant's natural resources increases in quality to such an extent that its value is greatly enhanced, becoming a viable source of monetary income.

#### **Foul Airs**

An outbreak of disease in nearby lands is blamed on foul airs. A large group of peasants arrive from a low-lying village to escape the bad airs and come to the covenant, where they have heard that the air is much more pleasant.

#### **The Statue's Secret**

An ancient statue at the covenant develops the ability to speak as a result of a strengthening aura, and reveals a hidden clue about the site's history.

#### **Tome of Prophecy**

The otherwise mundane diary of one of the covenant's educated servants is discovered to be unnaturally accurate in its predictions, causing the magi to clamour eagerly over this "tome of prophecy."

## *Magic Regiones*

Regiones (see **ArM5**, page 189) are found within some Magic auras and some covenants. A regio in a covenant typically provides a number of benefits, such as being able to guard more easily against intrusion into magical areas, separating the magi from the covenfolk, and simply providing more space. Regiones can, however, be a bit of a mixed blessing, and their appearance often causes problems. They may come to occur within a Magic aura in several ways.

The most usual cause of a Magic regio is a powerful magical event or accident. Magic auras are places where the mundane world begins to overlap with the Magic realm. Where a change to a Magic aura happens too fast or too powerfully, the fabric of reality is put under too much stress and it tears, causing the aura to fracture into one or more regio levels. Irencillia, the domus magna of House Merinita, is an example of a regio that has arisen in this fashion (although their aura is Faerie, not Magic). Criamon magi often view such a regio as a type of adulteration (see *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*, page 53). Hermetic magi have yet to discover any reliable and trustworthy means of creating a Magic regio in such a fashion.

As noted above in the rules for aura variation, rapid and repeated instabilities in an aura, reflected by the number of botch dice for Aura Strengthening and Weakening rolls, increases the chance that a regio will arise. If this happens (a botch outcome), the new regio has two levels — a mundane level (aura 0) and a level with aura equal to the overall aura score. Everyone present in the aura receives 3 Warping Points (This requires all magus characters to roll for Twilight). If there is *already* a regio, then an additional intermediate level arises; determine the aura of such new levels randomly. A regio can never achieve more levels than the aura score plus 1, however. Each level must have a different aura strength, which cannot exceed the overall aura score (which is always the same as the top-level aura strength). If there is a double botch or worse, all Warping Points gained are doubled, and the aura fracturing occurs in a highly inconvenient or dangerous way. For example, the sancta of the magi are found to be on the mundane level, but the guest quarters and the barracks are on the top level, or there is no way that can be found to navigate between the levels. If the botch is not so severe, you may assume that most of the aura's contents (the buildings, if the aura is that of a covenant) occur at the top level. It is possible to navigate the levels without magic, although this typically requires a special route or method that may need to be discovered and practiced. Lower levels might either appear as a ruined or empty version of the top level, or as an exact or similar copy of it. In the former case, a covenant's aura fracturing could appear to an outside observer as if the covenant itself has been either destroyed or abandoned, which would likely require a good cover story.

The appearance of a new regio in this fashion is rarely a positive event. All characters undergo Warping, typically causing one or more of the magi to experience Twilight. A great deal of chaos and confusion among the covenfolk is caused by the appearance of a new level of existence in their home, and injuries and even deaths may result. In the case of a double botch (or worse), then the experience should be especially bad. In either case, the creation of a regio is a good opportunity for a story, and the storyguide should determine the precise effects.

The appearance of new regio levels in an existing Magic regio is somewhat less troublesome than the instantiation of a new regio. The upheaval for the inhabitants is less, although Warping is still suffered.

Magic regiones can also arise due to the impingement of a stronger foreign aura, but this is significantly rarer, at least for covenants. The foreign aura compresses the area of the Magic aura so strongly that the Magic appears to vanish. Usually the Magic aura has indeed vanished, but sometimes it will instead move up into a regio, leaving the lower level in contact with the foreign aura.

Little is known about any other mechanisms for the creation of Magic regiones.

![](_page_12_Picture_11.jpeg)

![](_page_12_Picture_12.jpeg)

Some magi have speculated that the secret of performing this feat is known to the practitioners of a Mystery Cult, perhaps the Cult of Mercury. Other magi — usually those who have visited the Magic Realm and experienced Twilight — have claimed that the process of creating a regio is easier and more stable if it is done from the Magic Realm itself.

If the aura score of a regio decreases, then the aura strength of the top regio level will usually decrease. The exception is if there is already a regio level whose strength is equal to the new, lower aura score; in this case, the strengths of the levels do not change, but the top regio level vanishes. When a regio level vanishes, it becomes utterly inaccessible, and all living things in it immediately drop down to the next-lower level and gain 3 Warping Points. This could even cause magi to lose access to their sancta and possessions. It is a matter of speculation whether such disappeared regio levels are destroyed or merely dormant, but there is at least one documented case of a "lost" regio level reappearing intact after many years of absence.

If the aura score of a regio increases, then the strength of the top regio level will usually increase. This does not cause any new regio levels to come into existence. The exception is if there exists a vanished or dormant regio level of strength equal to the new, higher aura score; in this case the dormant level might become accessible again.

## *New Spells and Spell Guidelines for Auras*

Although magi have yet to master the art of manipulating and creating Magic auras and regiones, that doesn't stop them from trying, and some have invented Ritual spells that they claim will strengthen auras or even create regio levels. The few magi and covenants that have tried these spells, however, report varying degrees of success (and, more rarely, disaster).

Magic auras might conceivably be created or improved simply by the repeated expenditure of vis, although this is certainly not a cost-effective use of vis. The ability to create permanent tethers lies beyond standard Hermetic magic, although magi who have been initiated into the Mystery of Hermetic Architecture have a reliable — albeit difficult — method of improving a magic aura by such means; see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, page 100. Under the rules presented here, a Creo Vim structural enhancement to increase the aura score by 1 point should be interpreted as creating a new preternatural tether of sufficient strength to increase the preternatural aura score by 1 point. It is also possible that other Mercurian rituals may exist that can accomplish this feat. The Founder Verditius was rumored by some to have the ability to create portable tethers, known as magestones. Durenmar and an urban covenant in the Rhine Tribunal are secretly in possession of a small number of such stones.

#### **New Creo Vim Guideline**

**General:** Potentially strengthen a Magic aura; roll on the Aura Strengthening Table with a modifier equal to magnitude; the modifier must be 0 or greater, thus the minimum possible base level is 4 (Ritual).

#### **New Creo Vim Spells**

**Feeding the Font of the Covenant** CrVi General

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Boundary, Ritual Causes an immediate roll on the Aura Strengthening Table for the Magic aura in which it is cast, with a modifier equal to the spell's magnitude minus five, adding one to the number of botch dice for this roll and for subsequent yearly rolls. The modifier must be 0 or greater, thus the minimum possible spell level is 25. The yearly aura modifier (including the +1 bonus from the casting of this spell) does not add to the roll. If the casting of this spell is botched, a suitable outcome might be either to roll as above, but on the Aura Weakening Table instead, or to make the roll an automatic botch, resulting in the regio outcome.

(Base effect, +1 Touch, +4 Boundary)

**Stratifying the Subtle Realities** CrVi General

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Boundary, Ritual Req: Muto

A variant of *Feeding the Font of the Covenant*, this spell likewise causes an immediate roll on the Aura Strengthening Table for the Magic aura in which it is cast, with a modifier equal to the spell's magnitude minus 6, but treating a roll of 2 as a 0 and adding five to the number of botch dice for this roll and for subsequent yearly rolls, meaning that a regio (or new regio levels) is somewhat more likely to result. The modifier must be 0 or greater, thus the minimum possible spell level is 30.

(Base effect, +1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +1 Muto requisite)

#### **New Intellego Vim Guideline**

**Level 4:** Discern the alignment of an aura.

#### **New Perdo Vim Guideline**

**General:** Potentially weaken a Magic aura; roll on the Aura Weakening Table with a modifier equal to magnitude; the modifier must be 0 or greater, thus the minimum possible base level is 4 (Ritual).

#### **New Perdo Vim Spell**

**Stripping the Superfluous Realities** PeVi 30

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Boundary, Ritual Req: Muto

An inverse variant of *Stratifying the Subtle Realities*, this spell causes an immediate roll on the Aura Weakening Table for the Magic regio in which it is cast, with a modifier equal to 0, but treating a roll of 2 as a 0 and adding five to the number of botch dice for this roll and for subsequent yearly rolls. If a botch results then the desired effect occurs, which is that the regio level in which it is cast is destroyed. Even if this spell does not immediately remove the targeted regio level, the extra botch dice for subsequent rolls in following years might cause it to later vanish. Depending on the outcome of the roll, this spell might have the (probably) unwanted side effect of weakening the aura instead. If the casting of this spell is botched, suitable outcomes might be to roll as above, but on the Aura Strengthening Table instead, to inadvertently destroy the wrong regio level, or to otherwise corrupt the structure of the regio.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +4 Boundary, +1 Muto requisite)

## *Aligned Auras*

Most Magic auras are not aligned in any special way, and few magi are aware of the existence of such unusual auras. No aura has more than one special aspect, of which the following are a few examples. If it happens that more than one of the following is applicable — for example, if an aura is sustained by a natural feature tether of level 5 aligned with Auram and is the home of a Magic creature aligned with Greed that is powerful enough to generate a tether of level 2 — the level of the aura benefits from both but only the Auram alignment is discernible since it is the stronger. An Intellego Vim spell similar to *Sense of Magical Power* (**ArM5**, page 157) can be used to determine whether the aura is one of the following special types, but a different spell is required from the one used to establish that the aura is Magic, and the spell must be modified to test for each variant. For example, an Intellego Vim spell might be cast to ask the question "Is this aura aligned with hunger?"; a slightly different spell is needed to ask the question "Is this aura aligned with thirst?", and another to test "Is this aura aligned with Mentem?".

Auras of this type up to and including level 5 are generally safe to inhabit. At higher levels, those who live there without having a Magic mystical ability (e.g. The Gift) suffer permanent Warping and thus gradually become attuned to the locale, while even visitors may be affected temporarily. At its most extreme, inhabitants become so adjusted to the demands of the place that they find it very hard to leave.

## *Auras that Enhance Emotions*

There are some Magic auras that can have a direct effect on the emotions and behavior of those who venture into them. This does not affect characters with a supernatural ability derived from the Magic realm, (for example The Gift), but others find that they acquire a new Personality Trait or that an existing one is modified. The exception is that this cannot alter an Essential Trait. After spending a few minutes in such an aura, a character gains a temporary new Personality Trait or a modification to an existing one, if he happens to have something that supports or opposes the nature of the aura, according to the Aura Effect Table. The temporary effect fades within minutes once the character leaves the aura, although any permanent Warping acquired there remains.

To the perceptive, the nature of the aura may be apparent in their surroundings. At low aura levels, things that spend all or most of their time within the aura show slight changes in line with the nature of the aura. At higher levels, the effects become stronger and become noticeable in things temporarily under their influence. At the highest levels, the enhancements are very obvious and resident creatures are archetypes embodying the Trait or feeling.

Examples of such emotion-enhancing auras include:

**Aggressive:** Leaves are pointed and have sharp edges, many plants have big, sharp thorns; flowers shed irritant pollen; scents

| Aura Effect Table |                   |  |
|-------------------|-------------------|--|
| Aura              | Personality Trait |  |
| Level             | Adjustment        |  |
| 1 – 3             | +1                |  |
| 4 – 6             | +2                |  |
| 7 – 10            | +3                |  |

are unpleasant. Insects and animals are more aggressive than normal and have the armaments (bigger horns and claws, larger stingers, sharper teeth, etc.) to carry it through; at high levels some creatures acquire natural weapons not normal to the species. Edged weapons grow sharper. People become more aggressive such that spontaneous fights break out.

**Carefree:** Creatures display less wariness than usual; people become relaxed, losing all motivation to do anything but take their ease in the stronger auras.

**Communicative:** Plants gesticulate. Animals are very vocal at low levels; as the aura increases in strength they may sound as if they are trying to talk, and at the highest levels they actually can. Stone, even landscape, molds itself to try to convey information (usually about itself). People become more garrulous and may be unable to keep secrets.

**Respectful**: People become more concerned for the feelings and well-being of others, first other people then creatures and plants; in the strongest auras they acquire a reverence for life so extreme that walking on grass is impossible.

## *Aligned Aura Example*

Two of the covenant's grogs are escorting Bernard, a young novice, back to the priory where he lives. They have to go through the forest but he assures them he knows the way. Before long they are lost and enter an area under the influence of an ancient standing stone. It has started to get dark so they decide to make a temporary camp for the night. Bernard is already anxious about the dangers he perceives all around, but puts his faith in prayer and says nothing as he settles down to try and sleep.

They have camped in a place with a Magic aura of level 3 that induces fear. The grogs, Paul (normally Brave +3) and Ignatio (normally Courageous +2), are feeling just a little less confident about the strange noises in the dark than usual. Their Personality Traits are adjusted by Fearful +1 and are now at +2 and +1 respectively. Bernard is normally Cowardly +2 but the aura has enhanced this to +3 and he is soon begging the others to draw their swords and protect him from the wild beasts he knows are coming to eat them.

## *Story Seed: Uniformity*

A scroll at Harco reports a possibly unique locality with a Magic aura that was once visited by a Redcap. She describes walking through a region that was entirely typical of the area she was traveling through, and soon finding that the environs were becoming more uniform and eventually devoid of identifiable landmarks. It became so much the same in all directions that she started to feel disorientated and feared becoming lost in this featureless landscape. Eventually she found her way out, or was helped by a resident of that bland place, but was unable to say for sure where she had been.

![](_page_14_Picture_19.jpeg)

## *Auras Aligned with Arts*

Rarely, an aura promotes activities in a way that magi interpret as an Art alignment.

Sometimes such an aura is found where magic of a particular sort was practiced over a long time. Often these are sites associated in folk memory with pagan worship or working of ancient magic. Some in the Order claim that study of such places was a key component in the development of Magic Theory.

There are powerful Magic creatures in the world closely aligned with one Form. The long-term abode of that creature gradually acquires a Magic aura, and sometimes this becomes colored by the nature of the entity.

Some strong auras that develop around natural features are similarly aligned with one of the Forms of Hermetic magic (see above). At the storyguide's discretion, instead of the Warping effects suggested above, manifestations of the Form may occur (see below).

Because auras of this type behave as if aligned with the Techniques and Forms, they provide a bonus equal to the aura level to the Casting Score for any spell cast under their influence that uses the relevant Art. Thus, the aura modifer counts double when calculating the Casting Score. In the same way, the aura strength gives a bonus to appropriate laboratory activities, so counts double when calculating the Lab Total. Benefits also apply to spell-like effects produced in other ways; for example, by non-Hermetic magic. A creature with Might of the same type as the aura's alignment need expend 1 point less than usual to use a Power, if the usual cost is greater than 0. Such auras do not impose a penalty for use of an "opposed" Art; i.e. alignment with Perdo does not hinder use of Creo, and alignment with Aquam does not penalize Ignem.

Some examples of Art-aligned auras are: **Animal:** Inhabitants gradually acquire characteristics — physical, behavioral, or

both — of a suitable animal. The choice may be obvious from the nature of the character, or can be selected by the storyguide.

**Aquam:** Inhabitants may find their skin cracks if not kept wet. A character with a Warping Score over 8 may move by flowing.

**Auram:** Inhabitants may become oblivious to weather. A Warping Score of 8+ can push a character to lose solidity, becoming gaseous.

**Corpus:** Inhabitants become less likely to suffer minor illness, and scratches heal quickly. This isn't strong enough to affect recovery from wounds and disease until a Warping Score of 6 is reached, when the character gains a bonus to Recovery Totals based on aura strength.

**Creo:** Things are healthy and grow strongly, and are more abundant and/or larger than usual for a Magic aura; at the highest aura levels, things spoken of appear. An example is the site of fertility rites.

**Herbam:** Inhabitants may grow hair of grass or wooden toenails and fingernails. Warping Scores of 6+ cause skin to become bark and slow down movement significantly.

**Ignem:** Inhabitants may develop body temperatures above or below the norm, or their skin may start to glow softly.

**Imaginem:** Inhabitants with a Warping Score of 6+ may be perceived more strongly by one sense than any other; they may be vivid to sight but scarcely audible, or perhaps almost invisible but easy to hear or smell.

**Intellego:** There is a particular clarity in the air; sounds travel well; at the highest levels, intuition is strong. For instance, at a site where the stars were studied to learn of current and future events.

**Mentem:** Inhabitants may acquire a degree of telepathy, or an affinity with ghosts.

**Muto:** At low aura levels, things never look quite the same twice; at the highest levels, changes are so blatant that it is perilous to be there — grogs can turn into pigs, a sword into a flower, etc. An example is Circe's cave.

**Perdo:** At low aura levels, things decay and crumble faster than usual; at higher levels, the damage is dangerous. For instance, at a site of funeral rites or destructive rituals.

**Rego:** At moderate aura levels, a regularity in the landscape, in the spacing of trees, and the like. A site where magic was used to exert control would be one example.

**Terram:** Inhabitants may develop stone toenails and fingernails, or mottled skin like the local rock type, and reactions are slower.

**Vim:** Inhabitants may develop any type of weirdness that the troupe agrees is interesting. At a Warping Score of 6, unGifted characters are likely to acquire the Magical Air Flaw.

## *Other Aligned Auras*

There are a very few auras with alignments that manifest that are not part of an Art. Such an aura has an effect on what goes on inside it in an appropriate way, depending on the strength of the aura. A few examples follow:

**Healing:** Add half the aura strength (round up) to the Recovery Total for wounds or disease.

**Luck:** At the storyguide's discretion, add a bonus of +1, +2 (for an aura of strength 5 to 8), or +3 to rolls where luck plays a significant role in the outcome for all characters in the aura, including those who already have an advantage from the Minor Virtue Luck.

**Distracting:** Characters daydream or their attention flits about. Concentration rolls should be more frequent, and at aura levels of 5+, concentration is hard to maintain (set Ease Factors 3 higher than normal).

## *Aligning an Aura*

The library at Durenmar contains several reports of experiments to deliberately impose an alignment on an existing Magic aura. One researcher tried using an enchanted item to repeatedly cast Creo Ignem spells over a long period in hopes of aligning an aura with Ignem, without success. Another set grogs to telling jokes and singing comic songs, in hopes of creating an aura alignment with jollity. As yet no reliable way of imposing an alignment has been discovered, although serious botches have produced detrimental alignments on more than one occasion.

## *Covenant Boons and Hooks*

When designing a covenant, the troupe may select from the following, in addition to those given in **ArM5**, Chapter 6 and *Covenants*, Chapter 2. The aura may have only one alignment, but that may produce both a Boon and a Hook.

#### **Major Site Boon**

**Fine Aura:** The Magic aura of the covenant has an alignment that benefits most of those within it. For example, it is has the characteristic "lucky" or is favorable for healing.

#### **Minor Site Boon**

**Favorable Aura:** The Magic aura of the covenant has an alignment that favors one particular activity. For example, it is aligned with one of the Arts, or with a characteristic that is often beneficial, such as "attentive" or "respectful."

#### **Minor Site Hook**

**Troublesome Aura:** The Magic aura of the covenant has an alignment that sometimes makes activities that should have been simple much harder, and thus provokes stories. An aura aligned to Perdo is an example, as would be one aligned to "rashness," or "discourtesy."

## *Chapter Three*

# *The Magic Realm*

The Magic Realm is one of the greatest mysteries of Mythic Europe. Many magi are confident that this parallel to Heaven, Hell, and Arcadia exists, for a few of those who traveled there have returned to tell of what they discovered. But these accounts vary so wildly that no one has a clear idea of how this place functions or what it contains. It is regarded as extremely dangerous and remote, but a great challenge for a masterly magus to conquer or explore. Magi cannot even agree on a name — there are as many words to describe it as there are ideas about its nature, and so the only generally accepted and understood term is "The Magic Realm." (In this book, "Realm" is capitalized to distinguish the place, as opposed to references to the realm of Magic in general.)

No one in Mythic Europe understands the Magic Realm very well; it is hard to reach, and would be difficult to understand even if one could examine it at leisure. Thus, while this chapter includes some story hooks and descriptions that can be used to narrate adventures in this land of mystery and majesty, its primary purpose is to present the rules governing travel, magic, and long-term events in the Magic Realm. It also outlines three different perspectives about what is really going on, which are held by magi and others with knowledge of the realm of Magic.

## *Magic Perspectives*

Throughout history, many magi and others aligned with the realm of Magic have entered the Magic Realm, but few have returned, and those who do give conflicting reports of what they discovered there. No one knows enough about the place to be able to describe it with certainty, and only a master of Magic Lore would have the knowledge to even theorize about its properties. A saga that features a visit to the Magic Realm should seem a wholly new experience for those involved, as characters must discover how the Realm functions and adapt to it over time.

There are essentially two parts to the Magic Realm. The first part is the Realm proper, believed to be comprised of an infinite number of magical locations connected by magical boundaries, which can contain magical beings or objects and are often filled with semi-illusory objects and images called vestiges. Many of these locations are aligned to one of the Hermetic Forms, and the things found there tend to be especially representative of the ideals of that Form. The second part is known as the Twilight Void, and is generally thought to be sparse, dark, and foreboding, filled with omens and portents, and home to ancient and powerful beings that it is wisest not to disturb.

The Twilight Void is described in more detail below. For the rest of the Magic Realm, here follows three different theories about what may be found there, each based on interpretations of the rules that govern the Magic Realm (see Rules of the Realm,

![](_page_16_Picture_10.jpeg)

![](_page_16_Picture_11.jpeg)

below). Characters who have studied or visited the Magic Realm may come to their own conclusions, of course, which may be very different from these. Each interpretation is designed to serve as a starting point for storyguides interested in developing a story that takes place in the Magic Realm, and so each theory has a story hook that can be used to introduce the idea to a saga.

## *Worlds Within Worlds*

Many travelers imagine the Magic Realm as a collection of individual worlds each contained within a single thing. For example, it is said among certain philosophical magi that a single tree can hold within it an entire forest. The Magic Realm is thought to be the forest that may be found inside every tree. Every location a traveler can visit in the Magic Realm is another world, where everything is somehow connected back to something else. Each of these worlds is called a **cosm**, and has a distinct place in the Magic Realm.

A cosm can be bigger than the thing to which it is connected. For example, a single pebble found on a road can contain an entire country inside it. This is known as a microcosm — a tiny world inside a larger one. Or, a cosm can embody one aspect of a greater

![](_page_17_Picture_6.jpeg)

Changes to a cosm are usually reflected back upon the connected worlds. Imagine that a badly injured man enters a microcosm of his own body, where all of his natural functions are depicted as part of a great castle. Yet there is a great breach in the wall of the castle, and the man struggles to repair it with the stones and mortar he finds nearby. When he returns to life outside the Magic Realm, he finds the worst of his wounds are patched and have begun to knit closed.

Cosms generally relate back to things in the mundane realm, but not always. It is thought to be possible for a microcosm to contain another microcosm within it, or even to be part of a macrocosm elsewhere in the Magic Realm. Legend tells of an artist who drew a landscape so perfectly that he walked into it, and when he looked back over his shoulder he saw the face of a woman admiring his work, and he knew this was his true love. He quickly sketched a portrait of her, and it was so lifelike that she came to life. Soon after she died of a mysterious illness — the lady in the mundane world had pined away, for love of the man who she could see inside the drawing but could not touch.

Cosms usually resemble the mundane world superficially, but many natural laws are often suspended, especially those concerning geography and the natural tendency for objects to travel downward (what modern people usually think of as gravity). For example, the microcosm of a precious stone might be an elaborate system of smooth, polished tunnels that continually double back upon each other and even overlap in space. A traveler can descend down a passage and find himself back at the top again, and if he happens to drop something, it might continue to fall endlessly, speeding past him again every few hours.

## *Story Seed: The Stubborn Summer*

A prosperous covenant has an unusual problem: summer has never transformed into autumn and winter has not come. The temperature of the entire region has remained at a warm constant for the whole autumn season, and shows no sign of cooling off for winter. Drought and famine is likely to follow in the next year. Then, one of the residents of the covenant experiences a vision — with the help of a human outsider, the lord of summer has taken the lady of winter captive, and holds her prisoner in his magic forest. This act has thrown the climate of the region out of balance, since according to the natural order of things, summer yields his power to winter every autumn, and winter yields her power to summer in spring.

The reason the lord succeeded in overpowering the lady is that he had the aid of a human minstrel who has entranced the lady with his song. The lord of summer rewarded the singer by promising him eternal life, but now he is as much a prisoner as the lady, since the lord fears he will need his song again if she tries to escape.

The forest of summer is located within a cosm, which is connected to every deciduous plant in the region. An enormous castle may be found there, where the lord lives, beneath the hot summer sun and made of wood as hard as stone, surrounded by mighty oaks. The land superficially resembles the region surrounding the covenant, and the geography may seem to make sense — perhaps the castle appears to be located deep within a great forest near the covenant — but when travelers try to leave the area, they become turned around and soon return to the castle after a few hours.

The lord of summer and the lady of winter are said to have the power to visit the mortal world, and to court with their subjects at their palaces every season. If there are any magical trees in the area, they may be convinced to allow a representative of the covenant to accompany them to such an audience. Or, if the characters find some way to gain the attention of the lord or lady, such as by magically altering the climate, they may find themselves summoned by the lady to ask for their help, or by the lord to explain their challenge to his authority.

The members of the covenant could set things right by helping the lady to escape and return to her own palace. They might also ransom her, by offering the lord something of great value for her release — their service to his cause, for example. In either case, this is likely to lead to war between the two nobles, since summer must be conquered to force him to relinquish his dominion to winter. Another possibility is marriage — if summer and winter are wedded, their lands would belong to both of them, and order might be restored.

(Note: While this story may seem to resemble a fairy tale, all of the supernatural players are clearly part of the Magic realm, since they are based in the natural world and do not particularly care about the humans who live within their demesne. Since people in Mythic Europe do not necessarily recognize the differences between the realms of Faerie and Magic, though, they might very well describe obviously inhuman beings like these as "fairies.")

## *The Magic Archipelago*

Some travelers imagine the Magic Realm as a physical place, part of the world's sphere that is somehow connected to the rest of Mythic Europe, overlaying it like a giant regio — over it, like a sphere of magic found just below the lunar sphere; or beneath it, as a kind of underworld at the center of the earth; or even beside it, on another end of the globe. Each location in the Magic Realm

![](_page_18_Picture_1.jpeg)

can be described as an island within a great sea, or perhaps as distant countries separated from each other and the rest of the world by mighty rivers. According to this perspective, the Magic Realm is an enormous chain of these metaphorical islands, called **insulae** (singular *insula*).

Insulae usually appear as places in the mundane world, but supercharged with magical power, like a very strong Magic aura or high-level regio. Some travelers with experience in insulae theorize that the Magic Realm is made up of nothing but a series of high-level Magic regiones where the aura and boundary levels exceed 10, and where the inhabitants are magical creatures that otherwise live as normal human beings, working and praying and making war like other medieval people.

It is possible for some travelers to navigate the "waters" between insulae, ferrying themselves and others back and forth between islands and between the magic and the mundane worlds. Like sea journeys in the mundane world, these magical journeys are perilous, for strange creatures are said to live in the deep Twilight Void, and all manner of snags and whorls can assail and delay those who risk their lives in the unknown. Those who live in the Magic Realm often have great respect for these "Ferrymen," as travelers might hear them described.

The culture of this version of the Magic Realm is remarkably exotic. An insular city might appear extremely foreign, with oddly shaped architecture, strange animals, and very alien ways among its people. Other islands might seem isolated and sparse, dotted with structures built from scavenged materials, and people who have become stranded there or who have been so changed by the power of Magic that they cannot live without it.

## *Pages of History*

An idea that may especially appeal to more academic characters is the idea that the Magic Realm is a sort of record of events in the mundane world — traveling into the Magic Realm is like traveling through the memories of the past. According to this view, each location in the Magic Realm is a specific moment in history, called a **tempus** (plural *tempora*). As travelers journey further from the mundane realm, they find records of older and older events, so that the most powerful magical places and things are especially ancient. This idea is especially popular

## *Story Seed: South of the Sun*

If the Magic Realm directly corresponds to the mundane world, some scholars of Magic Lore theorize it should be possible to travel there directly, by exploring beyond the furthest edges of Mythic Europe. Citing fabulous tales in ancient histories and the desire to see the lands described in them before he dies, an elderly magus commissions a fleet of ships to sail south, beyond the equator and around the *finis Africae* (the edge of Africa) to reach India and the magical kingdom of Prester John. He asks for younger magi to accompany him on the journey, to bring back word of their discoveries once they reach their goal.

Each magus who accepts the invitation will receive an item invested with *Leap of Homecoming* and probationary membership in the magus' covenant, which will become theirs once he reaches the Magic Realm. Each ship has two laboratories for the use of the junior magi, and during the first part of the journey they are free to leap back and forth between their home covenant and the ships. After the expedition sails past the Pillars of Hercules they will soon pass into the Magic Realm, where a number of interesting challenges might present themselves to the characters.

- The waters thicken and coagulate until the ships can go no further. The air is dry and parched, and oars placed in the ocean become stuck fast. (The sailors call this phenomenon the Liver Sea.)
- The ships are attacked by an enormous sea monster that tries to pull the travelers down into the Void beneath the surface of the water.

- The magi land at a strange port to ask directions and seek supplies, where men have the heads of animals instead of faces and only assist those who best them in battle.
- The waters become completely transparent, so that the sailors and magi can see down to the bottom of the ocean, where they see evidence of an ancient civilization.
- The characters rescue a group of sailors who have been stranded on an island for hundreds of years, who are halfmad from isolation.
- A water siren attempts to seduce the sailors, first charming them with her song, then summoning a terrible storm to dash them against the rocks.

The seas of the Magic Realm are bright and the air is healthy, though it may appear that the characters are sailing very close to the sun, which never sets. Diving into the water can take the traveler into the Twilight Void, as can passing through the many boundaries that surround the various islands and other features of the southern oceans.

Assuming the characters do eventually find Prester John's kingdom, and he agrees to accept the magus as his subject, the characters must then return home to claim their prize. Unfortunately, they will find that their *Leap of Homecoming* spells no longer work, since they have lost their Arcane Connections to the mundane world. They must journey back the way they came, or find another route that leads to their homelands.

among Criamon magi, many of whom believe that Twilight is a place outside of the circle of time, and that there they can alter the past with their actions in the present.

To explain this concept through analogy, travelers might describe the Magic Realm as the Book of St. Peter, in which all of a person's thoughts and deeds are recorded for the Final Day of Judgment. Each moment in the subject's narrative is a single page in the book, and by turning the pages, St. Peter can travel from one moment to the next in that person's life, traveling forward or backward through the book, in order to better judge how well the person has lived his life. So too can travelers in the Magic Realm pass from one tempus to another, visiting different events in the subject's history.

In a tempus, time might seem to behave very strangely, perhaps held in place and endlessly repeating a single event or series of events, or proceeding backward instead of forward. Magical beings who live in these locales often believe themselves to be part of the moment, so that travelers who discover what seems to be a famous battlefield might find and speak with the character who thinks he is the commander. These historical reenactments are believed by those who favor this interpretation to be scrupulously accurate views of history, as long as they have not been tampered with by outsiders.

![](_page_18_Picture_23.jpeg)

## *Empedocles Was Sometimes Right*

Many Criamon magi teach that time is a great circle, and that parts of the Magic Realm that they call Twilight exist outside of that circle of time — ideas originating from an ancient philosopher named Empedocles (see House Criamon, *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*). By entering the Magic Realm, they believe that they can throw off the chains that bind them to the physical world, escaping the endless repetition of history it represents, and that it is their own actions that determine what they will find there, good or ill.

None of these beliefs are demonstrably false, but few magi outside House Criamon give them much credence. However, there is much in the Magic Realm that would seem to support their viewpoint. For example, travelers do not age there, a fact magi could take as a sign that the Realm exists at least partly outside of time. Whether or not these magi are correct about the reasons for this phenomenon, or about the nature of the Realm itself, cannot be objectively determined.

## *Fact and Theory*

Although these three theories seem very different, it has not, so far, been possible to determine which, if any, is true. This is because each theory can account for locations within the Magic Realm that seem to fit better in the others.

For magi who believe that the Magic Realm is composed of cosms, insulae are simply particularly allegorical cosms, while areas that appear to be tempora are cosms that capture a moment of time that is particularly important for some object, although the object itself need not be important. The Twilight Void is described as the space between cosms.

The Ferrymen have the easiest time explaining the locations; there is nothing to stop an insula looking like a cosm or a tempus. They have more trouble explaining why changes in certain insulae influence the mundane world, but argue that this is not universally true, so the cosms theory cannot be right. Cosm theorists, on the other hand, accept that not all changes to the Magic Realm are reflected in the mundane world, because not all changes to a cosm are fundamental to the mundane thing to which it corresponds.

Those who see the Magic Realm as pages of history concede that magical creatures living within a tempus can change it. Realms that do not look like history once did, they claim. And it is very difficult to disprove this. For these magi, the Twilight Void is the time between times, which is why there seems to be even less time there than in the rest of the Magic Realm. These magi claim that there are sequences of tempora representing history; magi supporting other theories tend not to have visited them, and thus remain unconvinced. On the other hand, the magi supporting a temporal theory would dismiss accounts of a sequence of tempora that depicted things that never happened.

If a group of magi devoted themselves to exploring the Magic Realm over a considerable period of time, they might be able to make one or more of these theories more difficult to sustain. It has, simply, not yet happened, but it might happen in your saga. If so, the storyguide needs to decide on the fundamental truth of the Magic Realm, and provide evidence pointing toward it.

## *Rules of the Realm*

Perhaps the most basic principle of the Magic Realm is the idea that its inhabitants do not grow or mature; while there, they are immortal, essential, and ideal. This is not to say that they cannot do things or alter themselves or their surroundings, only that while they are in the Magic Realm, they do not develop or improve as characters. It is almost as if time stands still while they explore the Realm, though the events of the mundane realm still proceed as normal while they are gone, and time rushes to catch up with them as soon as they return.

To represent this concept in game terms, characters do not receive experience points while they are in the Magic Realm. Instead, they can collect vis. Knowledge is power in the Magic Realm, and quite literally so. Over the course of a season, vis of a single type chosen by the player manifests within the character, a number of pawns equal to the number of experience points he would have earned for that season. This vis might form

![](_page_19_Picture_14.jpeg)

Because of this timeless quality, characters do not need to make Aging rolls while in the Magic Realm, though time still passes and their actual age increases for each year they remain there. They heal wounds and recover Might and Fatigue levels as normal. Magical durations greater than Momentary do not end once their time has elapsed, however: durations of Diameter, Sun, and Moon always last until the end of the current season instead, and Year durations are effectively permanent for as long as the target remains in the Magic Realm.

Arcane Connections to things outside the Magic Realm are interrupted when they are brought into the Magic Realm, though they are re-established once the object is returned to the mundane realm. Arcane Connections do not decay while in the Magic Realm (except when brought through boundaries or vestiges, as described below), so something touched by a person in the Magic Realm is magically connected to that person for as long as he remains in the area.

The entire Magic Realm has a Magic aura of 10.

## *Into the Magic Realm*

Finding passage to the Magic Realm from the mundane realm is in itself a great discovery, for there are only three ways by which travelers can move from one to the other. These same methods can also allow travel within the Magic Realm, and can sometimes magically transport a traveler between regiones and other places associated with Magic in the mundane realm, causing the person to pass through the Magic Realm only briefly.

#### **Magic Regiones**

By crossing over the boundary of a Magic regio, travelers can sometimes enter the Magic Realm. This is done in the same way that a traveler passes through a regio boundary to another level, by following a particular ritual or applying a supernatural power or

![](_page_19_Picture_22.jpeg)

![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)

Ability that allows him to see through the boundary. There are very few of these gateways into the Magic Realm known to exist, and legend tells that they are always guarded by fierce creatures on the other side. It is also said to be rare for a regio boundary to open in both directions; most of the ones in myth and lore are said to have allowed passage into the Magic Realm but not out of it.

Some say that passage to the Magic Realm may be found occasionally on "the exterior side" of high-level regiones, meaning that the traveler steps past a regio boundary but does not move through it to the lower level. As he travels further from the boundary his surroundings begin to change, and once he leaves the area that is defined by the largest aura of the regio, he passes into the Magic Realm. However, this is not always the case; sometimes the traveler is unconsciously turned back to the regio level he left, or simply returns to the mundane level.

#### **Magic Powers**

Magic creatures occasionally have powers that allow them to travel from the mundane realm into the Magic Realm, and to take others with them as they go. They may also be able to use these same powers to return to the mundane realm, though this is thought to be more difficult. Magi who have been transformed into magical beings may invent spells that duplicate these powers. This means that they can enter the Magic Realm at will, assuming they can manage the effects — see Magic Realm Magic, below, for guidelines.

There are some things in the mundane realm that have a special connection to things in the Magic Realm. All characters with a Magic Might Score have the power to pass into the Magic Realm through these, and lead others through them as well, as long as the object through which they are passing is associated with the same Form as their Magic Might. This process is described in more detail below; see Boundaries and Vestiges for the sorts of things that have a connection to the mundane realm, and Magic Travel for the rules that govern the use of this power.

#### **Magical Disasters**

When the raw power of Magic becomes too much for the wielder, it can have unpredictable and disastrous effects. One of these effects is to transport the wielder or the things in the wielder's immediate surroundings directly into the Magic Realm. Magi are quite familiar with one version of this phenomenon (Wizard's Twilight), but many of them may not realize that it can also affect other things aligned with Magic, including inanimate objects and even the entire region in which a magical disaster has occurred.

Magical disasters are the most dangerous means of entry, for they can leave the traveler anywhere, potentially so far within the Magic Realm that it is impossible for him to ever leave. Among the most learned authorities of Magic Lore it is often suggested that this is what happened to Plato's sunken island of Atlantis, and the search for that lost city has driven and ultimately consumed many explorers of the Magic Realm.

Characters affected by a magical disaster can attempt to avoid it in exactly the same way as magi avoid Twilight, by making a Twilight Avoidance roll (**ArM5**, page 88), substituting the number of botches on the disaster roll for the number of Warping Points gained. If successful, characters may still suffer consequences as their immediate surroundings are affected — if a great deluge of water fills the empty space where their island once was, for example.

Some magical disasters are considered acts of God — no one knows exactly why they happen, but they are presumed to happen for a good reason. When a character finds himself in the Magic Realm and he doesn't know how he got there, it is probably because of this sort of disaster.

## *Boundaries and Vestiges*

The Magic Realm is a seemingly infinite array of interconnected places that travelers call by many different names — cosms, insulae, and tempora being the most popular. These are all joined together not just by their proximity or their similarities, but also by two other unique features of the magical environment, what those schooled in Magic Lore generally refer to as boundaries and vestiges.

Nearly every location in the Magic Realm is outlined by a realm **boundary**. This is similar to how different levels of a Magic regio are separated from each other by a regio boundary.

Realm boundaries have a level that ranges from 0 to 10, like regiones, and this is added as a bonus to all magic activities within the area, like a Magic aura. (This is in addition to the bonus a character receives for the constant Magic 10 aura.) Thus, a place with a boundary level of 1 would give a bonus of +11 to magical activities, while another place could have a boundary level of 10 and give a +20 bonus. Supernatural activities from a dif-

## *Story Seed: Crimes Revisited*

A magus has a caller whom he has never heard of before — an almost impossibly old man who requests a private audience with him. This man informs him that the magus himself has been accused of a crime, something he did many years ago when he believed no one else was watching. The man identifies himself as the appointed advocate for the magus in a court of Magic, where the complaint has been brought against him. This is not a Hermetic crime, but a crime in mundane society, such as murder or theft, and the advocate describes an eyewitness account of the event that is eerily accurate. In fact, for a small fee (perhaps ten pawns of vis), the advocate can bring the magus into the Magic Realm, to a tempus that demonstrates the entirety of the events in vivid detail as if they were both present when the crime was committed. While there, the two of them can investigate the facts of the matter and prepare their case.

If it seems clear the magus is guilty, the advocate suggests that the defendant try to make restitution for his act in the intervening seasons. If there are special circumstances that warrant arguing his innocence, they gather as much evidence as possible. Then the advocate returns the magus to the mundane world and promises to return in a year's time to accompany him to his trial. He also warns the magus that others in the court will be watching him and will know what he does, so he should not think to flee or commit any other crimes.

After a year passes, the advocate does not return and there is no word from this supposed court of magic. Has the magus been hoodwinked, or has something else happened to the advocate? Perhaps the court has dropped the case, or maybe in his absence they have found him guilty. It may behoove the magus to find some way to get himself to court and defend himself, rather than wait for the advocate to fetch him.

ferent realm do not receive the bonus.

Like creatures with Might, every boundary is somehow aligned to a particular Form of magic, such as Animal, Auram, Aquam, and so on. As with aligned auras (see Chapter 2: Magic Auras), this makes effects associated with that Form more powerful by doubling the bonus for the boundary. Thus within a Corpus boundary of level 4, Corpus effects would receive a +18 bonus (4 x 2 for the boundary, +10 for the aura). Like regiones, however, boundaries bring with them greater risk, and add a number of botch dice equal to the level of the boundary to every roll that benefits from the Magic aura.

Boundaries also produce vis. A number of pawns equal to (the modified level of the aura divided by 10, rounded up) appear somewhere within the boundary every season, usually in non-magical things that have been brought to the Realm from outside. This vis is typically the same type as the boundary, and fades within a season if it is not harvested. Thus, there will always be two pawns of Terram vis to be had within a Terram boundary of level 4.

Boundaries allow magical creatures to travel through the Magic Realm by passing through them like regiones. They often define an area that a traveler cannot go beyond if he does not pass through the boundary, though if they do not hinder passage then leaving the area encompassed by the boundary takes the traveler to another place, usually with the same boundary level or aligned to the same Form. The connection between these places may not be obvious, and they can even be wholly disconnected; for example, from an area that seems to be an underground cave, a traveler might pass through a tunnel and emerge from the archway of a ruined city on a hill, where there is no tunnel at all.

The Magic Realm also contains what learned travelers call **vestiges**. Vestiges are like perfect illusions — ghostly images aligned with a particular Form that encompass all five senses, but which are ultimately insubstantial to all but magical creatures of the same Form. A traveler may pass through vestiges as if slogging through mud or swimming through water. Their solidity depends upon their size — a mouse vestige would hardly hinder a person at all, while the vestige of a castle is impossible for even a giant to move through. Roughly speaking, if the traveler could move the thing in the mundane world, he can pass through it in the Magic Realm. Vestiges do not have enough substance to suffocate a person, and so a traveler who dives into the vestige of a lake might choke and gasp at the sensation of being surrounded by water, but would not drown.

Some vestiges are animate, and others are not. There are said to be places in the Magic Realm that are fixed in a single moment captured in time, seeming like a living painting where falling fruits hang motionless in the air and people stare unblinkingly at the horizon. Vestiges may be associated with unusual forms, such as a Corpus castle built of bones rather than stone, or Aquam "animals" made of water instead of flesh. Vestiges may even appear solid to multiple forms, or behave in ways that seem very unnatural and strange, such as a person who removes his head from his shoulders in order to get a better look at the traveler, or a fire that burns cold and dark, dripping with water instead of ashes.

Every vestige has a connection to something in the mundane world, though the precise nature of this relationship is a matter of great debate. Some call the vestiges reflections of the mundane world, while others say it is the vestiges that are reflected. These connections might be between two similar things, such as a tree and a vestige of that tree; or they can be smaller or larger, such as a single tree that is the vestige of an entire forest, or a forest that is the vestige of a single tree. Concepts that do not fit neatly into Hermetic Forms may be represented with vestiges, such as the vestige of the ownership of Lord Theobald's lands, or the vestige of the first day of winter in the Alps.

Sometimes, changes to one cause changes to the other; if a traveler destroys the vestige of a mundane tree, for example, that same tree will sicken and die in the mundane realm. As Theobald grows unpopular, the vestige of his lands in the Magic Realm will change to reflect this. Should a magical creature capture the Alpine winter and enslave it, spring will not come to the Alps until it is released. Some magi argue that this is always the case, but that it is not always obvious what a vestige connects to in the mundane realm. A vestigial tree may be connected to a mundane leaf, for example, so that destroying the vestigial tree only causes the leaf to fall.

Things with Magic Might do not form vestiges in the Magic Realm, though they may be affected by vestiges of concepts that encompass them. For example, imagine a sleeping dragon that lives beneath a covenant. The covenant has a vestige in the Magic Realm, and this vestige might look like the sleeping dragon. If a traveler were to slay this vestigial dragon, the actual dragon would not be killed. However, perhaps the consequence of slaying the dragon is that the covenant's aura fades to nothing, and this might wake the dragon from its slumber.

Just as boundaries are interconnected in the Magic Realm, so too are vestiges. All vestiges that are associated with to the same thing in the mundane realm are connected to each other, and magical powers can allow travelers to pass between them in the same way that they can pass through boundaries, moving from one vestige to another. Like boundaries, vestiges have a level that represents the

![](_page_21_Picture_14.jpeg)

![](_page_22_Picture_0.jpeg)

strength of the connection to the rest of the Magic Realm, which ranges from 0-10. An extremely powerful vestige might be level 8, and an average vestige would have a level of 4. A vestige with a level of 0 is not connected to anything, and cannot be used for travel.

Not everything in the Magic Realm is a vestige, and the proportion of vestiges in a region seems to be quite variable. Some magi have reported regions containing no vestiges, but magi in the Magic Realm rarely search closely enough to be sure. On the other hand, some regions seem to contain nothing but vestiges; regions like frozen moments of history seem to be particularly common, and are one of the main pieces of evidence used by those who argue that the Magic Realm consists of tempora.

## *Magical Travel*

Traveling through boundaries or vestiges is very similar to passing between levels of a regio. The character attempts to see the destination he wishes to reach by looking through the boundary or vestige, and then steps into it and beyond. Only characters with Magic Might or special powers like Second Sight or Magic Sensitivity can do this, although they can lead others through with them. Do not include the aura bonus in this roll, but you may add Form bonuses that correspond to the boundary or vestige. For example, a magus with Second Sight could add his (Herbam / 5) to the roll to see through the vestige of a tree or an Herbam boundary. The more powerful the vestige or boundary, the easier it is to travel through it.

**Boundary Travel: stress die + Perception + appropriate Ability + Form bonus vs. ((10 – current realm boundary level) x 3) – Familiarity modifier**

**Vestige Travel: stress die + Perception + appropriate Ability + Form bonus vs. ((10 –level of the vestige) x 3) – Familiarity modifier**

The Familiarity modifier is based on how well the character knows the destination, and reduces the Ease Factor for seeing through a boundary or vestige as shown on the chart below. Use only the highest Familiarity modifier for any given attempt. If the character has never been to the place he wishes to reach but is looking for something specific, or if he simply wishes to explore without a set destination in mind, his Familiarity modifier is 0. You should also note the amount by which the roll exceeds the difficulty, as this is the character's initial Speed modifier (see below).

| Familiarity F                        | amiliarity Modifier |  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|--|
| Enigmatic Wisdom                     | score               |  |

| the destination                      | 15                  |  |

Vestiges and boundaries that are connected to a specific location count as Arcane Connections to that location, but note that other Arcane Connections to places in the Magic Realm decay at a faster rate when traveling through the Twilight Void (see below).

The destination must be connected to the origin boundary or vestige, or else it must have a boundary or vestige level of at least 1, because otherwise there is nothing from which the characters may emerge. It is possible to return to the mundane realm through a boundary or vestige, but only if the destination is connected to the boundary or vestige, because places in the mundane realm do not have boundary or vestige levels.

If successful, the traveler and those he is leading with him find themselves in the strange magical landscape called the Twilight Void. While there, the characters are drawn to their destination at a constant speed, like floating down a river, using the character's initial Speed Level on the chart below.

| Speed Level L | ength of journey                            |

| 30+           | Momentary                                   |

The character leading the group is aware of the distance that must be covered, as he can perceive their destination (if he had no destination in mind, this is the same place where they started). This is the maximum length of their stay in the Twilight Void, and acts as a constant — they will reach their destination once this amount of time has elapsed, no matter what else they do.

The character who brought the group through the boundary or vestige can attempt to speed the journey by concentrating: treat the result of the following formula as the group's new Speed Level for as long as this character concentrates. As the Twilight Void is essentially timeless, it is possible for a character to maintain concentration indefinitely, but he cannot do anything else on the journey. If he stops concentrating, they revert to their initial speed.

Like the initial travel total, this roll does not include a bonus for the aura, but if the character has a Form bonus, the player can apply the bonus based on the type of vestige or boundary he is passing through. For example, when traveling through a Terram boundary, a magus can apply his (Terram / 5).

#### **Twilight Void Travel: stress die + Stamina + Concentration + Form bonus**

A botch on either of these travel rolls suggests that the leading character and his group are further delayed. Reduce the Speed Level by one step on this chart for each botch on the roll, so that two botches make a Sun journey into a Moon journey instead. If this lowers the Speed Level below 0, the leader loses his connection to the boundary or vestige for which he is heading, and the group is stranded in the Twilight Void.

It should be apparent that travel through the Twilight Void is very dangerous. Few magi ever return once they embark upon this path. It is not very difficult to pass through a vestige or boundary, especially one with a very high level, just as it is not very difficult for a magus to throw himself into Twilight. Once through, however, it can take a very long time to reach the destination, so long that the character will effectively leave the game. Unless this journey is the focus of the saga, players should be cautioned that blithely stepping into the Void could remove their characters from play indefinitely.

The durations of all supernatural effects expire as soon as they are brought into or out of the Void, even unusual durations such as Until (Condition). This includes the Parma Magica — magi must perform the ritual again each time they pass through a boundary or vestige — but not Longevity Rituals or other laboratory enchantments such as a talisman or familiar bond that do not have a spell Duration.

![](_page_22_Picture_22.jpeg)

Passing into (but not out of) the Twilight Void also causes all Arcane Connections to or from the character to degrade one level (see the chart on **ArM5**, page 84), so that an Arcane Connection with a duration of Months would become Weeks instead, and an Arcane Connection that normally lasts for Decades would only last Years. This does not affect Arcane Connections with Indefinite duration, though note that the connection is interrupted as long as only one of them is in the Twilight Void.

## *The Twilight Void*

The Twilight Void is a part of the Magic Realm that is fundamentally different from the rest of it. It is often described as a place that connects other places — many experts think of it as the moment between moments, what some Criamon magi call Twilight or their Founder's realm outside of time. Others call it the spirit realm, or the "machina mundi" — the mechanism underlying nature. Classicists consider it to be the incarnation of Plato's Realm of Forms, the place from which all things originate. It is a mysterious, ghostly setting that, apart from a magical disaster, may be reached only by stepping through a boundary or vestige.

There are at least ten different versions of the Twilight Void: one for each of the different Forms that are associated with Magic Might (Animal, Aquam, Auram, etc.). These are called **provinces** — when a traveler is in the part of the Twilight Void associated with animals, he is said to be in the Animal province, and when in the part that corresponds to water and other liquids he is in the Aquam province (magi and other travelers fluent in Latin would use the proper case, i.e. *Provincia Animalis* and *Provincia Aquae*).

As travelers pass through the Void, they may recognize the ghostly images of the places that make up the rest of the Magic Realm, but only those things associated with the province in which they travel. For example, in the Herbam province, the traveler would perceive plants, trees, and other vegetation in a forest, but no animals. Instead, animal shapes might appear as shadows interposed between the trees. No rocks would be visible except when outlined by moss, no sound of wind or water heard except the rustle and creak of trees as they move. Even the sky would appear dark and empty, with no clouds, stars, or sunlight.

All of these images are insubstantial, like

vestiges in the Magic Realm. They cannot affect travelers in the Void, and travelers cannot affect them. There are some things in the Void with substance, usually things that have been brought into the Void from the

## *Is This Twilight?*

While many magi call the Twilight Void by that name, it is not absolutely clear that this is where magi go when they are in Twilight. In particular, travelers who believe they have met magi in the Twilight Void have not been able to confirm that those magi were in Twilight at the time they met them, and magi who have gone into Twilight and met travelers during their experience cannot be sure that these travelers were not apparitions or figments of their imaginations. On the other hand, the Twilight Void is very big, and few of the magi able to travel there have specifically gone looking for other magi to investigate this phenomenon. The arguments in favor are mainly circumstantial: magi in the Twilight Void are unaffected by the mundane realm and time in much the same way as magi in Twilight, and there are no other obvious candidates for places for magi to go at that point. Many Criamon do not think that the Twilight Void is where magi go in Final Twilight, however, because it does not seem to them to be fully outside the cycle of time.

world beyond, but these are rare and typically guarded jealously by the natives who possess them. These beings are Daimons, powerful magical creatures who live in the Void but cannot leave it without forming an Aspect (see Chapter 7: Magic Spirits).

Travelers in the Void are immune to the hardships of nature: they do not need to eat, drink, or breathe. They do not age at all, and do not suffer Acclimation (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters). Their wounds neither heal nor worsen naturally while they are there, and they do not regain long-term Fatigue. For characters without Might Scores, or characters who have Might Scores that are not aligned to the province in which they travel, the Twilight Void is exactly like being in Twilight. They are insubstantial and unaffected by their environment.

In the Void characters do not gain experience, but they also do not accumulate vis like they do in the rest of the Magic Realm. They are essentially unaffected by the time spent within its provinces, and so travelers can simply pass through the Void without interacting with their surroundings at all. However, some travelers can also choose to explore the Void, and these adventures can lead to other rewards if the traveler can make sense of the environment and navigate it successfully.

To determine how well a traveler can make his way through the magical environment by striking off of the path and going in search of a particular goal, the player makes a Twilight Comprehension roll (**ArM5**, page 88), substituting a magic character's (Might Score / 5) for his Warping Score.

**Twilight Comprehension: Intelligence + Enigmatic Wisdom + stress die vs. Warping Score or (Might Score / 5) + stress die**

Success means that the character has a positive experience. This can also speed the character's journey back to the Magic Realm: subtract Enigmatic Wisdom from the character's Comprehension total, and if this exceeds the character's Speed Level, use that score instead. Failure means the character has a negative experience. If the character botches, this can delay his progress further, possibly stranding him in the Void forever. Reduce the character's speed by one step on the Travel Time chart above for each botch.

As when a magus comprehends Twilight, a positive experience in the Twilight Void has beneficial results. The character gains an appropriate Essential Trait at +1, or increases an appropriate Essential Trait by 1. If the character does not comprehend the experience, the results are negative: the character gains an appropriate Essential Trait at –1, or reduces an appropriate Essential Trait by 1. Then, roll a simple die. The character gains or loses twice this many experience points in an appropriate Art or Ability, and like other experience points gained in the Magic Realm, this experience may manifest as vis if the player so chooses. Then, if the character does not have a Might Score, he also gains this many Warping Points.

During this process, the character generally experiences the Void as a series of choices. It is said that everything in the Void is connected to everything else, and so each choice serves to narrow down the myriad possibilities of what the traveler is seeking to one unique thing. As an example, suppose a magus is seeking a friend of his in the Corpus province, a youthful Criamon maga believed lost. He leaves the path on which he entered the Void

## *Senses in the Void*

Travelers in the Twilight Void only perceive species associated with the province in which they travel. Here are some ideas of what that might be like.

**Animal:** Within the Animal province, travelers pick up powerful, musky smells, and animals out in the open are brightly illuminated against the darkness. Animals hidden under brush and behind rocks are obscured, but might be barely recognizable. Sounds of animals or other creatures with Cunning are magnified, such as their calls or breathing, and these transmit their thoughts (such as they are) in a manner intelligible to the aligned character. Animal products can be easily seen, so that the shape of a man dressed in skins might be invisible, but identified by his floating pair of lambskin boots, woolen leggings, leather hauberk, and fur hat, for example.

**Aquam:** Water and other liquids shine out through the gloom, and moistness and temperature can be sensed by touch, so that a being suffering from chills might feel recognizably colder — many things more properly belonging to the Auram and Terram provinces can be easily recognized by this, such as wet rain or cold stone. Travelers can move through water like walking through air, and can see shadows that suggest the presence of fish, plants, boats, or submerged objects. They can even walk upon the surface of liquids as if they were solid if they wish. Visibility under water is lessened, but sensitivity to motion in the water is heightened dramatically.

**Auram:** The world of the Auram province is misty and electric, charged with energy. Moistness and heat can be felt and even smelled upon the air, and the sound of wind and weather is so strong that a traveler can follow a breeze simply by listening carefully. Clouds and smoke shine brilliantly white against the black sky, and aligned travelers can pass through these phenomena as normal, or they can walk upon them as if they were solid, climbing upon them like hillocks in the air. Warmth and wetness are perceptible to the touch, just as they are in the Ignem and Aquam provinces, and any movement can be felt in the air as a breeze against nearby travelers.

**Corpus:** The dark landscape of the Corpus province is broken up by glowing human figures and human remains, shrouded by clothing, so that a monk in a cloak and cowl would appear as a pair of hands, a disembodied nose and a chin wrapped in shadows. Health and age are visibly recognizable and wounds and illnesses shade the image of the person, so that a young and healthy person with no injuries shines more brightly through the darkness than one who is old, frail, and suffering. Unlike the province of Mentem, where people appear ghostly and translucent, here they appear solid and starkly colored in the seemingly eternal night.

**Herbam:** In the Herbam province, everything seems full of life and the power of nature. All growing vegetative materials can be seen, healthy plants brighter than struggling ones, their colors changing depending upon the season: green in spring, yellow in summer, red in autumn, and brown in winter. Dead wood and other nonliving plant products appear nearly colorless. Wooden structures often blend in with nature, so that a village on a hill might seem a part of the forest surrounding it, and wooden tools and weapons feel stronger and heavier. A lush aroma permeates the environment, and it is possible to find a particular plant or tree by its smell alone.

**Ignem:** The Ignem province is an almost monochromatic place of light and shadow, heat and cold. The brightest things appear as pure white against the utter blackness of the darkest, and the hottest things appear fiery red and golden against the silvery-gray of coldness. A room would seem ruddy and closed-in when lit by torchlight, but open and bright in the pale yellow of the sun. Living beings normally give off heat, and may thus have a recognizable shape of color against the colder surroundings. The sensation of temperature is also increased, so that a traveler can sense movement within a few paces via a warmth or chill in the air.

**Imaginem:** Images nearly bombard the senses in the Imaginem province: colors are more vibrant, sounds are louder, and smells are more potent. Species travel much further in the Imaginem province than they do in the mundane realm, making it possible to eavesdrop on a conversation taking place as far away as the eye can see. Environmental images typically show the events of a particular moment, and this can create a bewildering sense of redundancy and the feeling that time is out of sync, as the same birdsong might echo endlessly in the distance, or the same figures on a road appear to walk the same stretch again and again.

**Mentem:** Emotions, thoughts, and minds make up the Mentem province, and these things are perceptible to anyone aligned with it. This means that travelers can easily understand all forms of speech. Intelligent beings appear as ghostly outlines of their physical forms, more or less solid depending upon the power of their emotional states, and tinted different shades of color roughly corresponding to the type of emotion they are experiencing — red for anger, green for envy, blue for sadness, and so on. Other objects may also appear if they are emotionally associated with an intelligent being who is present (such as his clothing or other possessions).

**Terram:** In the Terram province, the traveler's surroundings brighten as they become more solid. The most remarkable objects are precious gems and metals, which shine like the sun through the dark. Base metal and stone appear slightly less bright, packed dirt even less so, and dust can be only barely seen. Travelers can actually see color through loose material, making it easy to spot buried treasure. Solid objects made of organic materials also give off a faint light, much like loose dirt or clay, but have no distinguishing features. Through vibrations in the ground, travelers can sense movement far beyond their normal range of hearing.

**Vim:** The Vim province usually combines the properties of other spheres into a strange supernatural mixture. Magic things are visible to those aligned to Vim and become brighter as their magnitude increases, but many of the rules that places in the Magic Realm seem to follow do not always apply in that sphere. Spells and magical effects usually appear with properties of the sphere appropriate to their Form, as do magical beings. Divine, Faerie, and Infernal powers or beings are not visible unless they are somehow aligned with Magic (such as infernal powers made to appear magical, or faerie spells cast using the Faerie Magic of House Merinita).

and comes upon two figures, a man and a woman. He speaks to the woman, who steps aside to let him pass. Then he sees an old woman and a young girl, and when he touches the girl on the shoulder, she points to the passage behind her. Further choices distinguish the color of her features, her temperament, when she lived, where she grew up, and so on.

The traveler may never be aware of the effects his choices have or what qualities are being distinguished by any given set of possibilities, which is why it is not easy to comprehend the experience. Also, the more supernatural the traveler, the harder it is for him to succeed at this, since his greater effect upon his surroundings makes it harder for him to seek out anything other than himself.

## *Advancement*

As stated above, characters accumulate vis instead of experience while in the Magic Realm. Before returning to the mundane world, this vis may be used to transform a character that does not have a Might Score, allowing him to gain new Virtues and Flaws, or to change his existing Virtues and Flaws.

Generally only Hermetic, Supernatural, or General Virtues and Flaws may be affected in this way, and they should be somehow appropriate to the character's experiences in the Magic Realm. For example, a character who journeyed there to learn from the ghost of a former Criamon maga might gain Enigmatic Wisdom, and a character who sought out the blessing of the king of the wolves might receive a pelt that allows him transform into a wolf (Skinchanger).

Characters do not experience more than one transformation in a single season, though they do not have to use all of their vis at once. New Virtues or Flaws may take a little time to manifest once the character returns from the Magic Realm, giving him time to adjust to his new and improved self. If a Virtue or Flaw is transformed into a different Virtue or Flaw, the two should be somehow related, and characters cannot transform Virtues or Flaws that affect character creation, such as an Affinity with an Ability or Skilled Parens.

**Vis:** 0

Transform a Minor Virtue into another Minor Virtue, a Minor Flaw into another Minor Flaw, a Major Virtue into another Major Virtue, or a Major Flaw into another Major Flaw

**Vis:** 5

Gain a Minor Virtue and a Minor Flaw

**Vis:** 10

Gain a Minor Virtue

**Vis:** 15

Gain a Major Virtue and a Major Flaw

**Vis:** 20

Transform a Minor Virtue into a Major Virtue, a Minor Flaw into a Minor Virtue, or a Major Flaw into a Minor Flaw

**Vis:** 25

Gain a Major Virtue and a Minor Flaw

**Vis:** 30

Gain a Major Virtue

A Major Virtue commonly gained through transformation is Transformed (Being), which gives the character a Magic Might Score and is described in more detail in Chapter 3: Magic Characters.

## *Positive and Negative Traits*

Characters can become more magical by exploring and comprehending the Twilight Void. A common way for this to manifest is with Twilight Scars and Essential Traits (described in Chapter 3: Magic Characters, Essential Traits). These are typically associated with the province in which the character traveled, as the following effect suggestions indicate.

**Animal:** Traits that describe how the character responds to animals, or Traits that describe a form the character inhabited in the Magical Realm or that make the character resemble a particular animal.

**Aquam:** Traits having to do with the physical qualities of water, such as being cold to the touch or changing in response to the moon, or Traits that describe the character's Intelligence, Cunning, or Stamina.

**Auram:** Traits having to do with qualities of air and weather, such as crackling with electricity or being light and sanguine, or Traits that describe the character's Perception or Communication.

**Corpus:** Traits that describe the character's apparent age, or anthropomorphic Traits that make the character appear more human or look like a particular person, or any physical Traits.

**Herbam:** Traits that describe the color and texture of the character or that involve endurance and patience, or Traits that give the character properties of a plant or tree.

**Ignem:** Traits having to do with qualities of fire and heat, such as being quick to judge, passionate, or giving off light, or Traits that describe the character's Quickness or Presence.

**Imaginem:** Traits that affect the sound of the character's voice or the strength of his appearance, or Traits associated with specific colors or images encountered in the Magic Realm.

**Mentem:** Traits that affect what the character perceives or that influence the character's Personality in a particular way or to resemble a particular person, or any sort of mental Traits.

**Terram:** Traits having to do with qualities of earth and stone, such as being dependable, heavy, or cold, or Traits that describe the character's Dexterity or Strength.

**Vim:** Traits that describe the character's magical focus or that make the character resemble a magical being, or Traits that affect how the character interacts with magical beings or how he practices his magical influence.

## *Magic Realm Magic*

Hermetic magic works well in the Magic Realm, and magi typically enjoy the increase of power that comes with an effective Magic aura of over ten. Spells of a particular Form affect anything associated with that form, so that Rego Corpus spells, for example, affect Corpus vestiges, human-like bodies, or magical creatures associated with Corpus, no matter what they look like.

Standard Hermetic magic, however, cannot affect the unique features of the Magic Realm, such as boundaries and vestiges. There is no profound reason for this; it is simply that neither Bonisagus, nor any of the other Founders, had ever developed spells to do this, so that the techniques were not incorporated into Hermetic magic at its creation.

It is, however, not very difficult to extend Hermetic magic to cover this case. All of the guidelines given in this section become available as a result of a single Minor Breakthrough requiring 30 Breakthrough points (see *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages,* page 26). However, a magus may not start researching such a Breakthrough until he has visited the Magic Realm and dealt with either vestiges or boundaries, although not necessarily through his own magic.

![](_page_26_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **New Creo Guidelines**

The Art of Creo allows magi to create vestiges in the Magic Realm. By incorporating an Arcane Connection into the effect, a vestige can be created so that it is linked to that place for the spell's duration, enabling the character to travel through that vestige.

Creo also allows the magus to create boundaries in the Magic Realm, or increase the strength of existing boundaries. These boundaries are magically connected to other boundaries, and characters can travel across them, though it is impossible to predict exactly where in the Magic Realm this path may lead. If the caster has an Arcane Connection to another place in the Realm, he may connect a newly created boundary to it.

**General:** Create a boundary in a part of the Magic Realm that has no boundary, with a score equal to (the magnitude of the effect – 4), so that a Base Level 25 spell creates a level 1 boundary. The boundary is associated with the Form of this spell, which must use T: Boundary.

**Level 10:**Increase the score of a Magic Realm boundary associated with the Form of this effect by 1, to no greater than 2. Each additional magnitude increases the maximum score or the amount by which the boundary level is increased.

**Level 15:**Create a magical vestige, which is tangible to creatures of the associated Form. If the caster has an Arcane Connection to something in the Magic Realm, including another vestige, he may connect it to this vestige.

#### **New Creo Spells**

**Locus of the Literatus**

CrIm 20

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

With this spell, the caster creates a drawing of his location as a vestige, illuminated on a page inside a book that he carries with him. By casting this spell in several different places, the caster produces a map that may be used with InIm spells to travel more easily through the Magic Realm.

(Base 15, +1 Touch)

**Adoration of the Magical Isle**

CrAq 50

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual

This Ritual permanently increases the strength of an Aquam boundary in the Magic Realm by one, to a maximum of 5. This effectively boosts the aura in the region by 1, or by 2 when casting Aquam effects.

(Base 10, +1 Touch, +4 Bound, +3 maximum level)

#### **New Intellego Guidelines**

Intellego makes a magus able to recognize the connections between vestiges and boundaries, allowing him to more easily see through them when attempting to travel into the Twilight Void. Once there, he can also make it possible for him or others to perceive vestiges that are not associated with the province in which they travel.

**Level 3:** Detect a vestige or boundary associated with this Form. If it is cast with a Vision target, this effect provides enough information for the caster to pass through it (see the rules for Magical Travel, above).

**Level 4:** Perceive the Twilight Void through a target vestige or boundary. This gives the caster a +3 bonus to his Travel roll, and each additional magnitude increases this bonus by 3, so that a base 15 spell gives a +12 bonus.

#### **New Intellego Spells**

**See the Paths through the Void** InAu 20

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision

This spell allows the caster to recognize the level of all boundaries or vestiges he can see that are associated with Auram, and to pass through any of them into the Twilight Void if he should desire to do so.

(Base 3, +1 Conc, +4 Vision)

**Comprehending the Mystic Doorway** InHe 30

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Str

The caster can see into the Twilight Void through the vestige of a wooden structure in the Magic Realm, and lead others through it with a +9 bonus to his Vestige Travel Total.

(Base 10, +1 Touch, +3 Str)

#### **New Muto Guidelines**

Magi use the Art of Muto to change the way that things interact with the basic nature of the Magic Realm.

**Level 5:** Change the Form of a boundary or vestige. (Requisite)

**Level 10:**Associate a target with the Magic Realm, as if it had Magic Might of the same Form as this effect. This means it can affect things of that Form with other Magic Realm effects.

**Level 15:**Cause a target in the Magic Realm to become perceptible as a vestige to travelers in the Twilight Void. Many features of the Magic Realm, but not all, have this property naturally.

OR Cause a target in the Twilight Void to become visible as a vestige in the Magic Realm.

#### **New Muto Spells**

**Torch of the Realm-bound Reveler** MuIg 25

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

For the duration of the spell, the target may affect fiery objects with Magic Realm Magic in the mundane world, as if it had Magic Might associated with Ignem. For example, he could use an Intellego Ignem effect to see through a flame into the Magic Realm, and pass through it to a microcosm of that flame.

(Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

**Visions of Olympus**

MuMe 35

R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Group

This spell causes a group of intelligent beings in the Mentem province of the Twilight Void to become perceptible to others outside of the Twilight Void. For example, a traveler in the Twilight Void might find his way to the lair of a particular creature with which he wishes to communicate. This effect makes the creature able to see and hear him and several others for the duration, as if they were vestiges in the place where that creature lives.

A magus who accumulates vis in lieu of experience in the Magic Realm may also opt to convert those points of vis into an Insight into the magical manipulation of the Magic Realm (see *Ancient Magic,* page 8). For every pawn of vis he converts into an Insight, the associated effect has one magnitude. This Insight allows the magus to create a single effect according to the guidelines given below; the details of the effect should reflect the magus' experiences in the Magic Realm. A magus may only gain one Insight per season.

Since this is a Minor Breakthrough, a magus can also gain access to the guidelines by inventing a spell using them from a Lab Text created by a magus who has completed the research. (Lab Texts for effects created during the research process are no use for this.) It is quite possible that this Breakthrough has been achieved in the history of the Order, but not widely disseminated; most magi are not particularly interested in the Realm of Magic.

These new effects can make travel in the Magic Realm easier and more comfortable by magically manipulating vestiges and boundaries, or even transporting travelers to or from the mundane world. However, these effects draw upon the special Magic properties of the Magic Realm, and so only work there or through links between the Magic Realm and the mundane realm. Characters with Magic Might are considered to have a link to the Magic Realm, of the Form associated with their Might Score.

pired the effect ends immediately. The spells below use a wide variety of Forms as examples, but the guidelines are the same no matter what the target. You may also use these guidelines to design powers for magical creatures.

## *New Magic Realm Spells and Spell Guidelines (con't)*

#### **New Perdo Guidelines**

With Perdo, magi can temporarily destroy vestiges and other things in the Magic Realm, banishing them to the Twilight Void for a time. For as long as the effect lasts, the target is invisible and insubstantial, and trapped in the part of the Void that corresponds to his current location. The target often has no memory of the intervening time, as if he had been asleep or removed from the world entirely. Some magi speculate that this is exactly what happens when a magus goes into Twilight.

Hermetic Magic can also reduce the strength of a boundary in the Magic Realm, even destroying it altogether, though this always requires a Ritual. A place with no boundary and no vestiges is almost completely isolated from the rest of the Magic Realm, since it is impossible to travel there without an Arcane Connection.

**Level 5:** Destroy a vestige for the effect's duration. Destroyed vestiges can no longer be used for travel, either from or to.

**Level 10:**Remove a target to the Twilight Void for the duration, so long as it is in the Magic Realm or the caster has Magic Might associated with this Form.

**Level 15:**Permanently reduce the score of a boundary in the Magic Realm (of no greater than Level 1) by one level. Each additional magnitude increases the maximum level of the boundary or the amount by which it is reduced by 1.

#### **New Perdo Spells**

**When Fortuna Blinks** PeCo 10

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

The magus disappears from the Magic Realm for a moment, long enough to avoid a killing blow or a blast of flame, or any threat that immediately endangers him. If the danger is something physical, such as a large rock falling on the magus, he reappears either beside or on top of the intervening material, never underneath or inside it.

While good for desperate situations, this effect is somewhat inconvenient for magi, since the disappearance cancels their Parma Magica ritual. It is useful for characters with inherent Magic Resistance, though

(Base 10)

**Repose of the Eternal Moment** PeCo 35

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual

This ritual, which must be cast within the Magic Realm or by a character with Corpus Might, causes the target to disappear into the Twilight Void. As long as it lasts, it is as if he doesn't exist; he will have no memory of the intervening time when, and if, he returns. Note that when the effect is cast in the Magic Realm, it is effectively permanent. A magus determined to ensure he no longer ages might use this effect on himself, first creating a vestige of himself that can be used as a link to draw him back.

(Base 10, +1 Touch, +4 Year)

#### **New Rego Guidelines**

As in the mundane world, Rego gives increased control over one's surroundings in the Magic Realm, and allows magi to increase the rate of travel through vestiges or boundaries. It can allow passage from one province to another in the Twilight Void.

When traveling through vestiges or boundaries, the traveler experiences the journey as if he were passing through the boundary or vestige as normal, though the effect may be too swift for him to recognize any of the intervening details.

**Level 5:** Transport a target from one province into another. (Requisite)

**Level 10:**Reduce the length of a target's journey through the Twilight Void by one step. Each additional magnitude reduces the journey by another step.

**Level 35:**Transport a target instantly through a vestige or boundary, so long as the target is either in the Magic Realm or the caster has Magic Might associated with this spell's Form.

#### **New Rego Spells**

**The Night-Badgers' Burrow** ReAn(Te) 20

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group

Moves the targets from the Animal province to the Terram province in the Twilight Void. This can allow them to leave the Void through a Terram vestige or boundary.

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group)

**Swift Wings of Timeless Days** ReVi 20

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

The length of the caster's journey through the Twilight Void is reduced by three steps from his initial Speed Level. With a Speed Level of 6 the caster would return to the Magic Realm after a year, and this spell would increase his Speed Level to 18, meaning that he emerges after only a day.

## *Chapter Four*

# *Magic Characters*

For the purposes of this chapter, "magic characters" are characters that have a Magic Might Score, either because they have been created using the rules for Magic Character Creation below, or because they have somehow gained a Virtue that gives this to them, such as the Transformed (Being) Virtue described below — these characters are different from characters that are merely aligned with the realm of Magic, like magi or hedge wizards. They have many innate advantages beyond those accorded to all supernatural beings in the **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition core rules (page 191), and these are described here.

the course of 24 hours, so that a character with Magic Might 12 would recover one Might Point every two hours. Resting in a Magic aura can also increase this recovery rate (as described in the Auras and Might Recovery sidebar, below).

Certain spells and powers (such as Perdo Vim spells) can directly attack the Might Score of a character. A magic character is destroyed if his Might Score is reduced to 0 or less. Magic characters usually have a Might Score of at least 1, but it is possible for a very weak character to be designed with a Might Score of 0. Such characters are destroyed by deprivation or exposure, magic characters do not recover Might Points or Fatigue levels, and their wounds have an immediate chance of worsening, just as if they have overexerted themselves while injured. (Some magic characters struggle against this fact, especially if they were not born magical — it may be difficult for a magic human to remember that it does not need to sleep at night, or should not inhale when underwater.)

Magic characters can consume vis, activating it in the same way that magi do. Each pawn of vis from the same Form as the character's Might Score will immediately replenish 5

![](_page_28_Picture_7.jpeg)

As mentioned in **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition, Magic Might gives the character innate Magic Resistance equal to its Might Score, and this does not stack with other forms of resistance, though it is compatible with the Form bonuses magi receive from their Arts. Magi who become magic characters, for example, can add these bonuses to their Magic Resistance, just as they do with the Parma Magica, but they cannot add their Parma Magica to their Might Scores; they must use either their Parma or their Might for their base Magic Resistance.

Magic characters also have Might Points, which they spend to activate their powers. These are recovered at a constant rate over any effect designed to reduce their Might Score if it penetrates their resistance. The form of the destruction varies: a spirit might be banished to the Magic Realm, whereas an elemental may simply become inert. A character transformed into a magic being during play may be rendered mundane again. Other characters may simply die. The fate of characters who are destroyed by the loss of their Might Score is up to the storyguide.

Magic characters do not need to eat, drink, or sleep; they do not age, they have no need for shelter, and they do not even need to breathe. However, they cannot benefit from this, because in conditions that would cause a character without Magic Might to suffer from Might Points, or 2 Might Points if this vis is associated with any other Art; and when consumed, a pawn of vis will give the character a +2 bonus to its Penetration when activating powers appropriate to that type of vis. Magic characters can also study vis or use it in other ways described under Advancement, below, but the character can never spend more pawns of vis than its Might Score on a single activity.

Finally, by virtue of their Magic Might, magic characters have a mysterious connection to the Magic Realm that allows them to travel through it more easily and to interact with certain of its unusual features while they are there. This is described in more detail in Chapter 3: The Magic Realm.

## Magic Character **Oreation**

These rules show how to design characters that have Magic Might, for use as companion characters such as familiars or ghostly warders, as antagonists for a story involving the realm of Magic, or to fill other roles in an ongoing saga such as magical servants, contacts, allies, enemies, or resources of a covenant. They are for characters that begin the game with Magic Might, whether or not they were born with it or were somehow transformed by magic there are also ways for characters who do not have Magic Might to gain it, but these characters should be designed in the normal way and then given the appropriate Virtue later in the saga, rather than use these rules.

## Concept

The first step of making a magic character is determining its essential qualities and shape - what is often referred to as its "true form." This is basically what the character would be if it were not magical, though it may have natural advantages that make it especially suited to the realm of Magic. True form determines a great deal about the character, including its appearance and instinctive behavior, and also determines the character's initial Characteristics scores and starting Size.

Once you have the character's true form, vou should determine its base Characteristics.

## Magic Character Creation Summary

#### 1. PICK A CHARACTER CONCEPT

Choose the character's true form (animal, human, spirit, or thing), and determine its Characteristics, Virtues and Flaws, and Size.

Characteristics: 7 points assigned as in standard Detailed Character Creation (see ArM5 page 29), no Characteristic more than +3 or less than -3.

Virtues and Flaws: Assign the character's Virtues and Flaws as in standard Detailed Character Creation, including a Social Status Virtue or Flaw.

Size: Assign Size, with 0 indicating an average adult human. Add twice this value to the character's Strength, and subtract it from Quickness.

#### 2. DETERMINE SEASON AND ASSIGN ABILITIES

Season determines the magic character's starting experience points, which are used to assign it scores in any Abilities the character can learn, based on its Virtues and Flaws. A spring character receives 120 experience points, a summer character receives 360, an autumn character receives 720, and a winter character receives 1200.

#### 3. DETERMINE MAGIC MIGHT SCORE, AND CHOOSE MAGIC QUALITIES AND INFERIORITIES

Magic Might Score depends upon the power level of the saga and the character's role within it. (See the table under Magic Might, below.) Then choose Magic Qualities, magical powers, and other advantages, taking a number of Quality points equal to the character's Might Score. Magic Inferiorities give the character additional points to spend on Magic Qualities; like Virtues and Flaws, Minor Qualities and Inferiorities are worth 1 point, Major Qualities and Inferiorities are worth 3 points. Grog characters cannot take Major Inferiorities or Qualities.

#### 4. Finishing Touches

Choose appropriate equipment, combat scores, Confidence (if applicable), and inherent vis. Choose at least three Personality Traits that describe the character's behavior, and an Essential Trait that describes its true form.

Like any other character, you should begin with all eight scores at 0 and assign 7 points to them — negative points in one Characteristic give positive points in another, though at this stage they should not exceed +3 or -3. These should be assigned as seems appropriate regardless of whether or not the character's form would be able to use these scores, such as when the character is an inanimate object or even just a figment of the imagination.

You should also decide if the character is intelligent or not. Many magic beings have human intelligence, as the power of the Magic realm often affects a character mentally

## Auras and Might Recovery

Magic characters can recover Might Points more quickly when they rest in a Magic aura, though like mundane characters recovering Fatigue, the magic character cannot engage in strenuous activity while resting. The time in which the character's entire Might Pool replenishes depends on the strength of the aura modified by the magnitude of the character's Might Score, as shown below.

ENTIRE RECOVERY TIME: Subtotal = Aura - (Might Score / 5), then refer to chart

| SUBTOTAL | RECOVERY TIME |
|----------|---------------|
| 0        | 24 hours      |
| 1        | 12 hours      |
| 2        | 6 hours       |
| 3        | 3 hours       |
| 4        | 90 minutes    |
| 5        | 45 minutes    |
| 6        | 22 minutes    |
| 7        | 10 minutes    |
| 8        | 5 minutes     |
| 9        | 2 minutes     |

To determine how quickly individual Might Points are regained, divide the Recovery Time by the character's Might Score.

RECOVERY RATE: 1 Might Point per (Recovery Time / Might Score)

In a Magic aura of 3, a Might Score 10 character recovers all Might Points in 12 hrs., or 1 Might Point per 1 hr. 12 min. of rest.

In powerful auras, characters with low Might Scores recover almost instantly, making them especially dangerous if given even a few seconds to rest.

![](_page_29_Picture_29.jpeg)

![](_page_30_Picture_1.jpeg)

as well as physically, though it is uncommon in animals and extremely rare in magic things like elementals. While it is possible to play a recurring character that does not reason as humans do, this is generally not recommended (see the Cunning Characters sidebar).

During this step, you should also choose the character's Virtues and Flaws, which represent the natural advantages and disadvantages associated with its true form. First, you should take one of four Special Virtues that describe the type of magic being you are playing, described below. These include **Magic Human**, **Magic Animal**, **Magic Spirit**, or **Magic Thing**. (There is also a Virtue called Transformed (Being) that gives a character a Magic Might Score, but it is intended for standard characters to gain through play, not for use with these rules.)

You must also assign the character one of five Social Status Virtues and Flaws that generally describe how it interacts with human society and how it will be treated by others in the saga. These are **Magical Master** (Major Virtue), **Magical Champion** (Minor Virtue), **Magical Covenfolk** (Free Virtue), **Magical Friend** (Minor Flaw), and **Magical Monster**  (Major Flaw), and are described in more detail under Abilities, Virtues and Flaws, below.

You may then take as many additional points of Flaws as the character is typically entitled to, balanced with the correct number of Virtues. If your character concept requires any Virtues or Flaws, you must take them before choosing any others. You can take Virtues and Flaws that are associated with the character's magical nature later (these are called Magic Qualities and Inferiorities), so these should be natural advantages and disadvantages that describe the character at its most basic level.

Once you have finished choosing Virtues and Flaws, determine the character's Size and modify its Strength and Quickness, adding two times Size to Strength, and subtracting Size from Quickness. (If Size is negative, you will end up subtracting two times this value from Strength and adding it to Quickness.) Size can also be increased or decreased later in the character creation process, so you should always choose Size based on how the character would look if it were not magical.

#### **Magic Animals**

Magic animals are the most common sort of magic characters, having a beast for their true form. For the most part they look like the animals upon which they are based, though they may seem larger, wilder or stranger than

## *Character Guides*

To quickly describe a magic character intended to fulfill a supporting role in an adventure, or a character that will not regularly associate with the other characters' covenant, the storyguide can use a **character guide** instead of a full character sheet. This is a summary of requirements for designing magic characters that conform to a particular type or purpose in the saga, such as a species of magical animal or a race of magical human beings. It specifies what the character *must* have in order to function in the game session, but ignores other aspects of the character that are unlikely to come into play.

A character guide usually consists of:

**Magic Might:** This is the character's Might Score and the Form associated with the character's magical nature. It is often listed as a range of values, to accommodate similar characters designed to fill different roles in the saga.

**Characteristics and Size:** These scores are the minimum values after points have been assigned, including modifications from Virtues and other aspects of the character.

**Virtues and Flaws:** These are the character's required Virtues and Flaws, but these do not have to balance out as with a typical starting character, and if the character guide requires more Virtues or Flaws than that character can have, all of the character's choices must come from this list. For convenience, required Qualities and Inferiorities (see below) may be listed here as well, with an asterisk to distinguish them from Virtues and Flaws.

**Personality Traits:** Any Personality Traits listed here are required, and those with an asterisk are Essential Traits (see Essential Traits, below).

**Abilities and Combat Scores:** These are the minimum values the character can have in its Abilities, and calculated combat scores based on these values. The character cannot spend experience points on any other aspect of the character until all of its scores have reached these levels.

**Powers:** If the character has any powers, they should be described here.

The magic characters listed in the Bestiary section of **ArM5** (pages 193–194) may be used as character guides, as can the animals in the Book of Mundane Beasts appendix or those created using the rules in *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* on pages 38–43.

## *Character Guide: A Magic Hound*

**Magic Might:** 0-10 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Cun 0, Per +2, Pre –2, Com 0, Str 0, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik +2

**Size:** 0

**Virtues and Flaws:** Magic Animal; Improved Fatigue\*, Keen Sense of Smell\*, Lesser Power\*, Long Winded, Sharp Ears, Tough\*

**Personality Traits:** Hound\*

**Combat:**

*Bite:* Init +2, Attack +10, Defense +9, Damage +1

**Soak:** +5

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0/0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties**: –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 5 (distance running), Awareness 4 (keeping watch), Brawl 5 (bite), Hunt 4 (track by scent)

**Powers:**

*The Inexorable Hunter*, 5 points, Init –1, Animal or Corpus

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Once the hound is set on the scent of a creature or person, it can follow flawlessly for as long as is needed to locate it. The hound is not fooled by the various ruses of his prey, such as heading through water or doubling back. If the prey has Magic Resistance, this effect has to Penetrate in the usual fashion. Level 25 effect (Base InCo 3, +4 Arc, +1 Conc, +1 An requisite), Lesser Power (25 levels)

This is a sample character guide for a magic hound, such as one that belongs to a character with the Magical Animal Companion Flaw. It has everything a storyguide needs to run the creature for a game session, and if it were to join the saga as a permanent character the other details (Flaws, Inferiorities, Season and the rest of its Abilities) could be fleshed out quickly using the Magic Character Creation rules.

![](_page_30_Picture_37.jpeg)

mundane animals. To generate a magic animal character, you can use the stats of the mundane animal as a character guide (see the Character Guides sidebar). These might be taken directly from the Book of Mundane Beasts appendix, or generated using the rules in the Bjornaer chapter of *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* (pages 38-43), but note that animals created using those rules have free Qualities that are used to determine their base Characteristics and other natural features, and that these are different from the Magic Qualities described below.

All magic animals have innate equivalents of the No Hands and Mute Flaws. In addition, mundane animals usually have several minimum Ability scores and required Virtues and Flaws, and these are required for magic animal characters based on those animals as well, except that any Personality Flaws are optional — the player can take them as Personality Traits instead. Many magic animals also take the Unaffected by The Gift Virtue (see New and Modified Virtues, below).

During the Magic Might phase of character creation, you must subtract the character's Size from its Might Score, or add to it if Size is negative. (This does not change the number of Magic Qualities the character receives, as described below.)

#### **Magic Humans**

Magic humans are typically associated with Corpus, but have otherwise been so changed by the Magic Realm that they can no longer pass for human in their natural forms. They are perhaps the easiest character type to design, because for the most part they are designed like other human characters. However, all magic humans also have a monstrous appearance, giving them a –6 to all social interactions with mundane humans or animals (see Major Inferiorities, below). This does not necessarily mean that the character is ugly, just that it is supernatural in some obvious way: it could shine with a nimbus of golden light, for example, or appear unnaturally skinny or old.

While magic characters that have The Gift do exist, it is difficult to design such a character as a magus using these rules, as the way magic characters learn Abilities and Arts is different from the normal Hermetic apprenticeship and not very compatible with it. It is best to design the magus as a normal character and then allow him to obtain the Transformed Human Virtue (see below) after he has completed his apprenticeship. Note, however, that many magi do not consider

![](_page_31_Picture_7.jpeg)

#### **Magic Things**

There are some magic characters made up of otherwise stationary matter from any Form made animate by the raw power of nature and the influence of the Magic Realm. This can include living things such as a magical tree or a statue of an animal made flesh, or nonliving things made up of nothing but raw material held together by magic. In either case, it is dependent upon its Size for its Magic Might — to gain more Might, its true form must somehow become larger. The following chart shows the minimum Size required for each level of Might Score.

| Might Score M | inimum Size |
|---------------|-------------|
| 0             | –21         |
| 1             | –18         |
| 2             | –15         |
| 3             | –12         |
| 4             | –9          |
| 5             | –6          |
| 10            | –3          |
| 15            | 0           |
| (+5)          | (+3)        |

A magic thing can become larger either physically, by absorbing some of its surroundings into itself, or metaphorically, by becoming part of something more magical than itself. This relationship depends upon the magic thing being in constant contact with the larger entity — if they are separated, the character's Might Score is immediately reduced until they are reunited again. For example, a magical sword could increase its Might by acquiring a human wielder, but if that person should ever set aside or lose the weapon, then it would lose all of the power it had invested in that person by extension of its magical nature until they are reunited.

Magic things do not necessarily have hands to grasp with, or feet to walk with, but they can still move themselves about, though they travel very slowly. They can pick up objects that are smaller than they are, and even carry them as long as they can touch them. This is often frightening and strange to see, and it may appear that an invisible spirit is carrying the objects through the air or dragging them across the ground. Though magic things can speak and make other noises appropriate to their form, few of them do. Many of these characters will have

![](_page_31_Picture_13.jpeg)

![](_page_32_Picture_1.jpeg)

the Crippled, Mute, or No Hands Flaws (or Limited Movement, Limited Voice, or Limited Gestures if they are grogs; see Minor Inferiorities, below).

Like the claws of a magic animal, or a magic person's fists, magic things are not blocked by Magic Resistance unless they are subject to an active supernatural effect. Since they do have Might, wards against magic things must in turn penetrate their Magic Resistance.

Magi can enchant a magic thing as an invested device just like any other object, and there are said to be secret paths of knowledge that allow magi to take advantage of a magic thing's Might Score (such as Hermetic Empowerment, page 64 of *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, or Bind Magical Creatures, page 134 of *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*). It is not possible for most magi to have anything but an animal as their familiar, but there are mysteries for binding a spirit familiar, and there may be variations on these Virtues for bonding with a magic thing instead (see Spirit Familiar, *The Mysteries Revised Edition,* page 66).

Magic things always have Temporary Might (see Major Inferiorities, below), which means that they do not easily or quickly regain their spent Might Points and their wounds are bound to their Might Scores, so that each injury a character suffers reduces its Might Pool and manifests as vis. All magic thing characters receive the No Fatigue Quality at no cost.

#### **Magic Spirits**

Many types of magic characters have an insubstantial form, like ghosts, animate illusions, or Daimons. These characters' true forms are not physical and cannot generally be perceived or affected except by other magic characters of the same form. Without the power to manifest, they are invisible to all others and can pass through solid objects with ease; but when interacting with other spirits, they are as vulnerable as if they were flesh and blood.

Ghosts played as characters are always aware of their incorporeal nature, and thus recognize their magical limitations (they are not able to unconsciously assume a solid form, for example) and know the advantages and disadvantages of their spectral form (see Chapter 7: Magic Spirits).

To design a spirit as a magic character, begin with the Characteristics for a physical being: a human, an animal, or even an inanimate object. For example, an Imaginem spirit that is based on the sound of a dog's

## *Cunning Characters*

Characters with animal intelligence are generally not as much fun to play as characters with human intelligence, because Cunning limits what the character can reasonably know. Unintelligent characters are mostly concerned with their next meal, or what they are going to do that day, but rarely plan for the less immediate future. They do not learn or study except when trained by an intelligent master, so rarely gain experience points through any means other than Exposure, and they cannot increase Abilities that they do not possess naturally. They cannot use Confidence Points unless they have the Ferocity Virtue. They can follow instructions, but if they encounter a situation that requires a decision or a judgment call then they are unable to proceed; they either abandon the task or return to their master for guidance. They may seem to have a personality, but they do not interact with humans or others of their species beyond a superficial and predictable level, as they are motivated only by their natural instincts in response to stimuli.

Because the power of the Magic realm tends to improve characters over time, whenever an unintelligent character is significantly changed by the realm of Magic, perhaps by gaining a Virtue or Flaw through Warping or exposure to the Magic Realm, its player may choose to transform its Cunning score into Intelligence. Most players' regular characters will be intelligent, since there are no mechanical benefits for choosing to play an unintelligent character.

bark might look like a dog, while the ghost of a human might appear as that particular person did at the moment of his death. A fire spirit might look like a column of smoke and flames. Within the Magic Realm, or among other beings with the same sort of Might, this is the character's true form.

Spirits are generally considered immortal, though if a magic spirit's true form is somehow destroyed or banished, it ceases to exist as a character. It may return later and appear exactly the same as it did before, but for the purposes of the game this new spirit is essentially a different being. Magi familiar with the secrets of magical theurgy might call each manifestation an "Aspect" of the original.

Magic spirits always have an innate Magical Air that is very difficult for them to overcome. Even the spirits of magi who possessed the Gentle Gift make others very uncomfortable with their presence.

#### **Example: Aeolus**

*Neil's character at Semita Errabunda, Victor of Mercere, rides a magical horse named Aeolus, indicated by his Magical Animal Companion Flaw, and Erik decides to design it as a magic character for him or one of the other players to play in the saga. Neil has already described most of the character's personality and powers, so Erik will simply be applying those ideas to these rules.*

*Erik looks up the stats for a horse in the Book of Mundane Beasts, and decides that Aeolus is a charger. For reference, he copies down the charger's Character-* *istics (Cun –2, Per 0, Prs 0, Com –4, Str +4, Stm +3, Dex –2, Qik +2). These scores give Erik an idea of what Aeolus should eventually look like. He begins assigning points to his Characteristics, and ends up with Int –2, Per 0, Prs 0, Com +1, Str 0, Stm +3, Dex –2 and Qik +3 (the horse's +2 Size will increase Strength by 4 and decrease Quickness by 2).*

*Looking at Virtues and Flaws, Erik sees that he must assign Aeolus Long-Winded, Improved Characteristics, and Great (Quickness). With Improved Characteristics, he increases his Presence to +2. He also has to take a Social Status, and chooses the Minor Social Status Flaw Magical Friend to describe his relationship with the covenant and with Victor. He then takes two Minor Personality Flaws: Proud (like all chargers, Aeolus is rather self-centered), and Lecherous (Aeolus is an expert in animal husbandry, so to speak). He must also take Horse +3 as an Essential Trait.*

*Aeolus is Size +2. After this is applied to his modified Characteristics, his final scores are: Int –2, Per 0, Prs +2, Com +1, Str +4, Stm +3, Dex –2, and Qik +2.*

## *Season*

The next step in magic character creation is determining the character's experience with the world in which it lives. In **Ars Magica**, the number of experience points a starting character receives is usually determined by his age, since characters generally gain experience over the course of a year. Magic characters can still gain experience and develop like other characters, but it is

## *PCs and NPCs*

Every magic character in **Ars Magica** is designed the same way, no matter what its role in the saga, so that there really is no practical difference between a "player character" and a "non-player character." That said, sometimes it is useful to make a character that is more or less powerful than the others, perhaps to act as an antagonist in a conflict or to serve as a temporary ally for other characters in the saga — as a storyguide, you should feel free to assign these characters any Might Score that seems appropriate for their purpose without regard for their role in the saga, and to give them any Virtues or Qualities they like without worrying about whether or not the characters are properly balanced. You can also use character guides (see the sidebar above) to make these stats easier to read, and so that if the character ever becomes more involved in the saga, you can then develop it more fully, so that it is suitable for the long-term.

more difficult and not something that they can do every year. A very old magic character is not necessarily more experienced than one who has only been around a short while, since it may not have advanced as much or as often in the intervening time.

**Season** is a new statistic that replaces age for magic characters, and indicates how experienced the character is compared to other characters. Much like magi use this concept to explain the development of their covenants, Season divides a magic character's existence into four distinct stages: spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

**Spring characters** are underdeveloped, like children who are still adapting to their forms. They have only recently come into being, and have little practical experience with either the Magic Realm or the mundane realm. A spring human would be approximately five years old. While they have little practical experience, they also tend to seek out knowledge and new ideas.

**Summer characters** more closely resemble young adults in outlook and maturity, the equivalent of a human being of about twenty years of age. Where spring creatures wish to explore the world, summer characters generally seek instead to make themselves part of it, establishing communities and forming friendships with others of their kind, and embarking upon adventures together.

**Autumn characters** are more mature creatures; for a human being, this would be similar to a person of about 35 years of age. Their experience tends to be focused in two or three particular areas of knowledge, like a master of his craft, and their involvement with the world is more limited, confined to interaction with only a few worthy of their attention. They often adopt the role of mentors to other characters.

**Winter characters** are the eldest of beings, ancient creatures with countless years of experience. A mundane human in the winter season would be no younger than 50 years old. They are considered extremely wise and powerful, but also distant and detached, rarely involving themselves in the events of the outside world. Such creatures often retreat to the Magic Realm where they will not be disturbed.

Season is how you will determine the character's starting experience points. Choose which Season best describes the character, and consult the following table. These points may be spent as you would for any beginning character; you must have an appropriate Virtue or Flaw to purchase Abilities that are not General. If your character concept includes innate Abilities (as many animals do) you will need to spend your starting points on these scores first.

| Character S<br>S<br>eason E | tarting<br>xperience |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Spring                      | 120                  |
| Summer                      | 360                  |
| Autumn                      | 720                  |
| Winter                      | 1200                 |

This will almost certainly be too few experience points to properly describe the character, but you can gain additional experience in the next step of this process, as part of the character's magical nature.

#### **Example: Aeolus**

*Starting with Season, Erik decides that Aeolus is a Summer character. This gives him 360 experience points to spend. As he is a horse, he must take Athletics 4, Awareness 3, Brawl 2, and Survival 3 as innate Abilities. This leaves Erik 235 points. He increases Brawl to 4, and takes Area Lore 5, Charm 3, Folk Ken 2, Living Language 4, Profession: Mount 2, and Stealth 2. He also assigns appropriate specialties to all of these.*

![](_page_33_Picture_16.jpeg)

You must decide upon the character's Magic Might Score, and the magical Form with which the character's Might will be associated (usually based on the character's true form). Magic Might determines the supernatural strength of the character, and should vary depending upon the power level of the saga and the role that the character will play within it. This is probably the most important score on the character sheet, as all of the character's powers and everything about its magical nature follow from this, and so here are some guidelines to help you choose an appropriate starting value.

| Power G   | rog C | ompanion M | agus |
|-----------|-------|------------|------|
| Low       | 0     | 5          | 10   |
| Medium    | 3     | 10         | 20   |
| High      | 5     | 15         | 30   |
| Legendary | 10    | 25         | 50   |

**In this chart, a grog-level character** is about the same power level as a grog, though it does not necessarily protect the covenant or act as another character's bodyguard. The role works best for characters that will be shared by several players in the troupe, or that will be played as a direct extension of another character — often a good choice for a familiar or a character like a Ghostly Warder.

**A companion-level character** has special status at a covenant, and is typically played by only one member of the troupe. For many familiars, this might be the most appropriate role, especially if the creature is particularly independent or especially powerful — in these cases, one player typically plays the magus, and another plays his companion. Most characters associated with Magical Animal Companion are designed to fill this role.

A **magus-level magic character** is a character played instead of a magus, or designed to be approximately equal to a magus of the same power level. It is also possible for an actual magus to transform himself into a magical being, though it is often better to do this with the Transformed Human Virtue (see New and Modified Virtues, below), or through methods described in other sourcebooks.

These values are intended to produce a character that is similar in power to others in the saga, but of course the storyguide should feel free to assign the character any Might Score that seems appropriate to the circum-

![](_page_33_Picture_23.jpeg)

![](_page_34_Picture_1.jpeg)

stances. For example, if a magus manages to enchant as his familiar a beast with Magic Might 42, you should design the character that way, even though that value does not appear on this chart. (You could also design it with Might 30 and then increase that value with Magic Qualities.)

Magic Might gives the character its powers, but also limits the character's development, as described under Advancement, below. You must subtract the character's Might Score from all Advancement Totals, including exposure, adventure, and other forms of study. This means that it is very unlikely for a character with a Might Score of 10 or more to ever increase any of its Abilities through normal advancement.

Once you have determined the Might Score of the character, you also receive this same number of points with which to buy Magic Qualities. Qualities are supernatural aspects of the character that give it special advantages. Minor Qualities cost 1 point, and Major Qualities cost 3 points. You can also choose to take Inferiorities, supernatural disadvantages that allow a corresponding number of additional Qualities in the same way that Flaws allow a character more Virtues. These are also similar to Virtues and Flaws in that grog characters cannot take Major Qualities or Inferiorities.

See Qualities and Inferiorities, below, for a list of how these points may be spent.

#### **Example: Aeolus**

*For Magic Might, a base value of 10 seems about right for Aeolus's role at the covenant (it is a medium-power saga and Erik will play him as a companion), and this Might is obviously associated with Animal. Because he is a magic animal, his Might Score is adjusted by his Size, giving him a score of 8. He also has 10 points to spend on Magic Qualities.*

*Erik takes a Lesser Power that allows Aeolus to change his appearance, a level 15 effect, and converts the 10 spell levels left over into 2 points of mastery, reducing the casting cost from 2 Might Points to 0. He then takes Gift of Speech, as Aeolus is a talking horse. He also gives Aeolus three more Minor Virtues: Venus's Blessing, Unaffected by The Gift, and Improved Characteristics, which raises his Intelligence to 0. He spends the remaining points on Improved Abilities, since Aeolus has spent a lot of time with Victor in the mundane world, giving him 300 more experience points to spend. Erik does not see any Inferiorities that seem particularly appropriate to the character, so he decides he is done assigning Qualities.*

## *Aeolus, Magical Horse*

**Personality Traits:** Horse\* +3, Randy\* +3, Vain\* +3, Skittish +2

**Combat:**

size), Lesser Power (15 levels, cost -2)

**Equipment:** Victor's magical amulet, comfortable harness, ornate and expensively tooled saddle

**Vis:** 2 Animal, in head.

**Appearance:** His natural appearance is that of a horse of good but not exceptional breeding, with a chestnut coat and well-groomed black mane and tail. For appearances' sake when in public, he will wear a bridle, but this has been especially fashioned for his comfort and has no bit, since "he carn't tork pwopuhlee wiv a bah ih hih mouf." Victor has obtained a fine, expensively tooled and ornamented saddle for Aeolus, to match his vanity, and Aeolus prefers to wear it as much as possible. It annoys Aeolus no end that Victor will insist on pointing out how the saddle's value draws undue attention to them, and so they must generally share a plain saddle in public.

Aeolus is the Magical Animal Companion of Victor of Mercere, from Semita Errabunda. Out of earshot, Victor might say that Aeolus is "his" horse, but Aeolus would have it that Victor is merely "his" rider. It is Aeolus' considered opinion that he is the more intelligent and better-looking of the pair of them. It is he who comes up with all the bright ideas, though he allows Victor to believe otherwise as it is less confusing to outsiders. They often spend many hours on the road discussing the meaning of life and the nature of existence. Aeolus shares Victor's mad passions for the chase and the hunt, and is particularly vain and proud of his superior nature and his "way with the females." He is an intact stallion (with no intention of ever being gelded), and while he will often attempt to charm any human ladies who admire him or will listen to what he has to say, he generally prefers to put his magical good looks to use on other horses.

Victor owns a magical amulet that he has woven into Aeolus's mane. When someone speaks the command word, the charm grants the horse touching the amulet the power to ride across water, mud, or any other surface once per day. Since Aeolus can talk, he is generally the one who decides whether the charm is used or not. (Aeolus wants a charm that will let him gallop through the skies, but Victor has not yet been able to afford it.)

*It would be possible to make Aeolus as a grog instead of a companion, since all of his Virtues, Flaws, and Qualities are Minor. For a medium-power saga,*  *he would have a Might Score of 1 and only 3 points of Qualities to spend, though he could take Inferiorities to make up the difference.*

There are four Magic Qualities that give magic powers to a character, and these powers are designed like Hermetic effects of four different types. Each Quality includes a number of spell levels, a Might cost, and an Initiative score, which vary depending upon the type of power. These are summarized here for easy comparison. Note that with the exception of Lesser Power and Personal Power, all of these are Major Qualities. There are also Virtue equivalents for characters who do not have a Might Score (see New and Modified Virtues, below).

Like Ritual spells, Ritual Powers are always at least Level 20, and all powers with effects of Level 50 or more must be designed as Ritual Powers. An effect that would require a Ritual spell (such as a Boundary Target or Year Duration) also requires a Ritual Power.

A Greater, Lesser, or Personal Power can be made **constant**, triggering automatically at both sunset and sunrise and continuing perpetually as long as the character has a Might Score and the Might Points needed to activate it. The effect must be designed with Sun duration, and costs an additional magnitude on top of that. If the power has a Might cost, it is subtracted from the character's Might Pool every sunrise and sunset, whether the character is aware of it or not. If the character does not have enough Might Points, the power is temporarily interrupted until the next activation. A character can also spend a Confidence Point to prevent a constant power from triggering.

Penetration for a Magic Power is calcu-

## *Finishing Touches*

Magic characters are completed just like standard characters: make sure it has at least three Personality Traits, and that any Reputations are described. If the character is intelligent, is not a grog and does not have the Low Self Esteem Flaw, or if the character Fifth Edition: Might Score – (5 x Might Point cost) + Penetration bonus. This means that to increase a power's Penetration Total, you must decrease the power's cost, increase the character's Might Score, or improve the character's Penetration score. If a magic character receives an Inca-

lated as shown on page 191 of **Ars Magica**

pacitating wound, in addition to the usual effects (**ArM5**, page 178–179) the character cannot spend any Might points. He can still activate any powers with a zero cost. If the character has constant-effect powers with a non-zero cost they expire at the next sunrise or sunset and cannot be reactivated until the character is no longer Incapacitated.

A character whose Might pool has reached zero can no longer activate any powers unless they have a cost of zero. Powers that have already been activated continue until their duration expires; if they are constant-effect powers with a non-zero cost, then they cease at the next sunrise or sunset unless the character has regenerated sufficient Might points in the intervening period to reactivate them.

Wound and Fatigue penalties do not apply to powers. However, you can change this to make supernatural creatures less challenging, or to make their powers work more like Supernatural Abilities and other magical effects. One way to do this is to subtract Wound and Fatigue penalties from the character's Penetration Total. In a similar way, you could treat powers that cost Might Points to activate as spells that require Fatigue when determining whether a magic character's wounds worsen because of activities undertaken while injured.

has the Ferocity Virtue, give it a Confidence Score of 1 and 3 Confidence Points to start.

Every magic character has a special Personality Trait, typically at +3, that describes its true form. This is usually something simple, like "Raven," "Person," or "Tree," and is distinguished from other Personality Traits with an asterisk (\*). This is an Essential Trait (see Essential Traits, below) that helps en-

![](_page_35_Picture_15.jpeg)

You should calculate all of the character's combat scores, including its Soak and Wound level ranges, and assign any equipment you imagine it could have reasonably acquired and maintained, keeping in mind the character's strength and encumbrance. Finally, calculate the character's inherent vis, choosing its type, location, and the amount (this is typically equal to its Might Score divided by 5, rounded up).

## *Qualities and Inferiorities*

In much the same way that all characters have Virtues and Flaws, and covenants have Boons and Hooks, magical beings designed as characters have Qualities and Inferiorities. These represent how the character has been altered by the realm of Magic. They are classified as Major and Minor, like Virtues and Flaws, though they differ from Virtues and Flaws in that they can only be taken by characters with a Might Score, and in that they do not have to balance each other during character creation. A character starts with a set number of Quality points equal to its Might Score, and while taking Inferiorities gives the player more points, they are not required. Like Virtues and Flaws, the player spends one point for a Minor Quality, and three points for a Major Quality.

Qualities and Inferiorities are important for characters with Magic Might because they can gain new Qualities and Inferiorities through play more easily than Virtues and Flaws, and they can also lose them over time if they become too distant from the power of the realm. This distinction is unnecessary for characters that do not have a regular or recurring role in a saga, though — Qualities and Inferiorities can be treated as Supernatural Virtues and Flaws when it is not necessary to balance the character's statistics against other characters.

Most Qualities and Inferiorities can be taken more than once, but characters who are intended to serve a grog role in a saga may not take Major Qualities or Inferiorities, just as they cannot take Major Virtues or Flaws.

The term Qualities is also used to describe the natural advantages that determine

![](_page_35_Picture_22.jpeg)

### *Magic*

a mundane animal's Characteristics, found in the Bjornaer chapter of *House of Hermes: Mystery Cults*, pages 40-43. These "mundane Qualities" are not necessary for magic characters, and should not be listed on the character sheet to avoid confusion. However, they are especially useful for determining the required scores of a magic animal character (see the Character Guides sidebar, above).

Human characters with Magic Might may take Heroic Virtues and Flaws (*Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, pages 104-109) as Magic Qualities and Inferiorities.

## *Major Magic Qualities*

**Fatigue Mastery:** The character can spend its Fatigue levels instead of Might Points. Each Fatigue level is worth a number of Might Points equal to the character's (Might Score / 5).

**Focus Power:** The character has a magical power with a narrow range of effects, like the ability to cast spontaneous spells that are associated with a single type of magic. This power is like a magical focus, in that all of the possible effects have to be related to a specialty that is smaller than a single Hermetic Form.

The player receives 25 spell levels to spend on this power, which indicates the highest level effect that the power can produce. You can take it more than once to allow for more-powerful effects, but you are also limited by the character's Might Score — the level of effects that this power generates cannot exceed it. You can always take the power at a level higher than the character's Might and increase its Might Score later, and you can also allow the character to create effects of a level exceeding its Might Score with mastery points (see Minor Magic Qualities, Improved Powers, below). This power has a Might Point cost of the magnitude of the effect cast, and an initiative score of (the character's Quickness – the power's maximum magnitude). You should also note the Form or Forms associated with the effect, for the purposes of evaluating magic resistance.

Any spell levels that are left over may be used to increase the effect level of other Focus Powers, or converted into mastery points, with 5 full levels of effects equal to 1 mastery point. These may be spent like the mastery points gained from the Improved Powers Minor Quality on any of the character's Focus Powers. Note that the cost of a Focus Power cannot be reduced with mastery points.

**Gentle Air:** For those with Gifted or

Magical Air, this Quality removes all the social penalties associated with the character's magical nature, as if it did not have The Gift at all. If the character is both Gifted and has an inherent Magical Air, this lessens the penalty from a Blatant Magical Air to that of the normal effects of The Gift.

**Gifted:** The character has The Gift, or something very like it, in that it can learn Supernatural Abilities, can initiate new Virtues and Flaws through a Mystery Cult, and has a disturbing magical presence, as if it had the Magical Air Flaw. The character can even be opened to the Hermetic Arts, though its master's Intellego Vim Lab Total must equal or exceed ((30 + the character's Might Score) x 2) for the opening of the Arts to be successful. Only intelligent magic characters can take this Quality.

**Gigantic:** The character's Size is magically increased, making it obviously superior to mundane creatures. Because of this, the character is also stronger and proportionally slower to react. Consult the following chart to determine the amount by which the character's Size, Strength, and Quickness should be adjusted. Also note that this Quality does not change the relative shape or apparent age of the character, so that a Gigantic human child (Size –2) would become the size of a large adult (Size +1), but would still have the proportions and features of a child.

| Size        | Size<br>Increase | Bonus | Strength Quickness<br>Penalty |
|-------------|------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| –11 or less | +5               | +10   | –5                            |
| –6 to –10   | +4               | +8    | –4                            |
| –2 to –5    | +3               | +6    | –3                            |
| +1 to –1    | +2               | +4    | –2                            |
| +2 or more  | +1               | +2    | –1                            |

If the character has other Virtues, Flaws, Qualities, or Inferiorities that modify its Size, you should apply them in this order: Flaws, Inferiorities, Virtues, Qualities. You should determine its Characteristics first, so that they may be modified appropriately. For example, a base Size 0 character with Str 0, Qik 0, Improved Characteristics, Small Frame, and Gigantic would apply Improved Characteristics first, increasing its Str to +2; then Small Frame, reducing Size to –1; and finally Gigantic, increasing Size by +2, Str by +4, and reducing Quickness by –2, for a final result of Size +1, Str +6, and Qik –2.

This Quality may be taken more than once. If it is, apply the effects one at a time, and base the Size increase on the Size after

![](_page_36_Picture_16.jpeg)

![](_page_36_Picture_17.jpeg)

the previous Qualities have been applied. For example, a base Size 0 character who took Gigantic twice would increase to Size +2 from the first, and then, because his Size is now +2, by +1 for the second, to a final Size of +3.

**Greater Power:** The character has a spelllike power designed like a formulaic spell. Taking this Quality gives the character 50 spell levels to spend on this power, and these can be combined with the spell levels gained when taking this Quality more than once to allow for greater level effects. The power has a Might Point cost equal to (the magnitude of the effect / 2), and an initiative score equal to the character's Quickness – (the magnitude of the effect / 2). You should also note the Form or Forms associated with the effect, for the purposes of evaluating magic resistance.

![](_page_37_Picture_4.jpeg)

the character's Greater or Lesser Powers. **Improved (Characteristic):** Increase by one

## *Common Magic Powers*

The following powers are common among beings associated with Magic, and are good examples of the sorts of things that a magic character might be able to do.

#### **Crafter of (Form)**

Variable points, Init equal to (Qik – 5), appropriate Form

R: varies, D: varies, T: varies

Duplicates any of a range of non-Ritual Creo or Rego spells pertaining to the specified Hermetic Form, at a cost of 1 Might point per magnitude of the effect. The level of the effect cannot be greater than the creature's Might, or 25, whichever is lowest. This power affects only one Form, but some creatures have this power more than once, for different Forms.

Cr(Form) or Re(Form) 25: Focus Power

## **Enliven the Gross (Elemental Form)**

4 points, Init equal to (Qik – 10), appropriate elemental Form

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

This ritual-like power rarefies (creates) an elemental of the appropriate type (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Elementals) from a sufficient amount of raw elemental matter. The elemental can have any Might less than that of the creature using this power. The elemental is automatically under the control of the creature; this power can also be used to control elementals which are not of the creature's own making, but in this case must Penetrate the elemental's Might. When the creature has no further use for the elemental, its control lapses but the elemental remains.

CrFo 30 (base 25, +1 Touch): Ritual Power x2 (20 levels, –2 Might Cost, +2 Init)

#### **Equine Shape**

2 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Animal R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character can transform into a horse until the sun rises or sets.

MuFo 25 (base 10, +2 Sun, +1 size): Personal Power (25 levels)

#### **Flight of the Hummingbird**

0 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), appropriate Form

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character can fly through the air in any direction, simply by concentrating. If distracted, this control is lost but the power still holds the character aloft indefinitely.

ReFo 15 (base 4, +2 Sun, constant): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost)

#### **Grant (Major Flaw)**

10 points, Init equal to (Qik – 20), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

Imposes the named Major Flaw upon a victim. Each creature may have more than one power of this type, each bestowing a different Flaw. The creature can decide to bestow the Flaw permanently or temporarily. If permanent, the power is a ritual-like power and costs points from the creature's Might score as well as Might pool (see Ritual Power, below). If temporary, the Might points spent on this power are only recovered when its effects are withdrawn.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power x 2

#### **Grant (Minor Flaw)**

5 points, Init equal to (Qik – 10), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual Imposes the named Flaw upon a victim. Each creature may have more than one power of this type, each bestowing a different Flaw. The creature can decide to bestow the Flaw permanently or temporarily. If permanent, the power is a ritual-like power and costs points from the creature's Might score as well as Might pool (see Ritual Power, below). If temporary, the Might points spent on this power are only recovered when its effects are withdrawn.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power

#### **Grant Puissance in (Ability)**

4 points, Init equal to (Qik – 3) Corpus R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

Bestows prowess in a given activity. For every Might point invested, ten men can be given a +1 to all rolls in a general situation (such as combat, or woodcraft); or 1 man can be given a +3 to a specific Total or Ability (such as Soak or Hunt). Might points spent on this power are only recovered when its effects are withdrawn.

MuCo 20 (base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group): Lesser Power (20 levels, +1 Init)

#### **Grant (Major Virtue)**

10 points, Init equal to (Qik – 20), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

Imposes the named Major Virtue upon a target. Each creature may have more than one power of this type, each bestowing a different Virtue. The creature can decide to bestow the Virtue permanently or temporarily. If permanent, the power is a ritual-like power and costs points from the creature's Might score as well as Might pool (see Ritual Power, below). If temporary, the Might points spent on this power are only recovered when its effects are withdrawn.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power x 2

![](_page_37_Picture_43.jpeg)

a Characteristic that is already +5 or more. This boost is applied before the character's Strength and Quickness are adjusted for Size, so that a Size +2 and Quickness +3 character (Quickness +5 before Size is subtracted) who took this Quality could raise its Quickness to +4. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Magical Meditation:** This Quality gives the character the Supernatural Ability Magical Meditation at 1 (see New and Modified Abilities, below).

**Major Virtue:** The character gains a Major Virtue, usually either General or Supernatural (Magic), to represent an advantage of its magical nature. Note that while this Quality may be taken more than once, only Virtues that allow a character to take them multiple times may be duplicated multiple times. Also, if a Virtue has requirements or restrictions on the characters who may take it, the magic character must meet them. For example, only a magic character with The Gift (or the Gifted Quality described above) can take Hermetic Virtues.

**Natural Appearance:** The character appears to be a normal human being, with no traces of his magical nature. Just as the Gentle Gift hides all traces of The Gift in

## *Common Magic Powers (con't)*

#### **Grant (Minor Virtue)**

5 points, Init equal to (Qik – 10), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

Imposes the named Minor Virtue upon a target. Each creature may have more than one power of this type, each bestowing a different Virtue. The creature can decide to bestow the Virtue permanently or temporarily. If permanent, the power is a ritual-like power and costs points from the creature's Might score as well as Might pool (see Ritual Power, above). If temporary, the Might points spent on this power are only recovered when its effects are withdrawn.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power

#### **Guide**

3 points, Init equal to (Qik +1), Mentem R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group

Subtly influences a group of beings toward a specific course of action. Some creatures can use this power to direct the movement of a group, taking it to a desired location. Other creatures can guide humans toward rash actions, or brave actions, or wise actions. Each time this power is used, it can subtly influence the actions of a single person for a day. The storyguide should provide advice to the character in a similar way to the Common Sense Virtue, except that the advice serves the creature's agenda, not that of the character. There is no compulsion to follow this advice.

ReMe 30 (base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 Group): Greater Power (30 levels, +4 Init)

#### **Hands of the Magical Animal**

0 points, Init (Qik – 2), approp. Form R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

This allows an animal to manipulate and carry an item as if it had human hands and a Strength of +5. The character must concentrate to do anything other than carry the object, including dropping it or taking something else.

ReTe 15 (base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 constant): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost)

#### **Healing**

3 points, Init equal to (Qik – 9), Animal or Corpus

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

Heals a human or animal — the worst of the target's wounds improves by one level. The healing is achieved when the recipient performs a specific action, such as drinking from a sacred spring, or swearing a vow. This is a Ritual Power that subtracts from the creature's Might Score as well as from its Might Pool (see Ritual Power, below). If possessed by a genius loci and the target creature is indigenous to the spirit's locus, then all wounds are healed, not just the most serious one.

CrCo 30 (base 25, +1 Touch): Ritual Power x 2 (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +1 Init)

#### **Human Shape**

1 point, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Corpus R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character transforms itself into the shape of a normal human being, allowing it to move through mundane society relatively unnoticed.

MuFo 20 (base 10, +2 Sun): Personal Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost)

#### **Master of (Form)**

Variable points, Init equal to (Qik – Might cost), appropriate Form

R: varies, D: varies, T: varies

Duplicates any of a range of non-Ritual Muto or Perdo spells pertaining to the specified Hermetic Form, at a cost of 1 Might point per magnitude of the effect. The level of the effect cannot be greater than the creature's Might, or 25, whichever is lowest. This power affects only one Form, but some creatures have this power more than once, for different Forms.

Mu(Form) or Pe(Form) 25: Focus Power

#### **Oath-Swearing**

10 points, Init equal to (Qik – 10), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group, Ritual

Enforces the power of a solemnly-sworn oath between two or more parties. All parties must agree to the oath of their own free will, and it must Penetrate the Magic Resistance of all parties to take effect. If a participant in the oath tries to act in direct contravention of it, he immediately becomes aware of this. If he carries on regardless, then he is struck with a Minor Flaw. This Flaw can be removed by re-swearing the oath in front of the original participants. This power persists until there is no further record of the oath, either in the memories of the participants or in written form. New participants may be added to the oath by swearing to it in the presence of the creature, and if it pays the original Might cost again. Unlike the Grant (Flaw) power, the Might points spent on Oath-swearing regenerate normally.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power.

#### **Sight Beyond Sight**

1 point, Init equal to Qik, approp. Form R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision

All five senses of the creature operate at a distance, as far as the creature can see. This gives the creature supernaturally aware of everything which occurs, and it is exceptionally difficult to catch it by surprise

InIm 30 (base 5, +1 Conc, +4 Vision): Personal Power x 2 (20 levels, –2 Might cost, +2 Init)

![](_page_38_Picture_44.jpeg)

a magus, this allows Magic Humans to hide their inherently monstrous appearance, and Magic Things in the shape of humans or animals to seem to be living flesh and blood, rather than animated matter.

**No Fatigue:** The character is tireless, meaning that it has no Fatigue levels, does not suffer Fatigue penalties, does not need to make Fatigue rolls, and cannot fall unconscious. It also cannot exert itself as other characters do, though the character can still simulate the loss of a Fatigue level by spending a Confidence Point, if necessary.

The character does not need to sleep, which means that it effectively has two additional seasons each year in which to study. However, because of the limitations on magic character advancement, it is unlikely the character will be able to take advantage of this extra time.

**Ritual Power:** The character has 25 levels of powers that replicate Ritual-level effects, and if this Quality is taken multiple times, these spell levels can be combined to allow for an effect of greater magnitude. Any effect can be designed with this sort of power, even effects that break Hermetic limits. These powers have a Might Point cost, which defaults to the magnitude of the effect, and Initiative for the power is equal to the character's Quickness – (the magnitude of the effect x 2). You should also note the Form or Forms of the effect, for the purposes of evaluating Magic Resistance.

Besides reducing the character's Might Pool, Ritual Powers also require the player to subtract one from the character's Might Score for each point in the Might cost, whenever it activates the effect. This lost Might may return over time, at the storyguide's discretion, but at a much slower rate than recovering lost Might Points. For example, each point of lost Might Score could require the character to rest for an entire season in a Magic aura of no less than (its Might Score / 5), or perhaps to consume vis of the same type as its Might, a number of pawns equal to its original Might Score.

Alternatively, instead of reducing its Might Score, the character can lose one Confidence Point for each Might Point in the activation cost. It can do this whenever it has enough Confidence Points, even if the number of Confidence Points would exceed the character's Confidence Score. If the character has Confidence because of the Ferocity Virtue, it can only use them to activate the Ritual Power in the specific circumstances associated with that Virtue.

![](_page_39_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Vis Mastery:** The character may expend some of its magic as vis. Each pawn manifests as the same Form as that associated with the character's Might Score, and either costs the character a Confidence Point or subtracts one from the character's permanent Might Score.

The character may also consume vis in place of Confidence Points. Each pawn is equivalent to a single Confidence Point, and the player may spend them to activate any power the character possesses that requires Confidence Points, but the player cannot spend more pawns at once than the character's Confidence Score in this way.

## *Minor Magic Qualities*

**(Form) Resistance:** The character's Magic Resistance is aligned to a particular form, and it begins with a score of 1 in the corresponding Supernatural Ability (see New and Modified Abilities, below).

**Gift of Speech:** The character can speak and make sounds as a human. (This Quality allows a Magic Animal to overcome its natural inability to talk.)

**Improved Abilities:** You gain 50 experience points, which may be spent on any Abilities or Arts that the character can learn. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Attack:** One of the character's natural weapons is magically enhanced, making it more accurate. Increase its Attack value by 2. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Confidence:** The character's Confidence Score is increased by one. A starting character also gains two additional Confidence Points to spend. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Damage:** One of the character's natural weapons is magically enhanced, making it sharper, heavier, or somehow more dangerous. Increase its Damage value by 3. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Defense:** One of the character's natural weapons is magically enhanced, so that the character can better parry or dodge. Increase its Defense value by 2. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Fatigue:** The character can last

![](_page_39_Picture_20.jpeg)

![](_page_40_Picture_1.jpeg)

longer before becoming tired, as its resistance to fatigue is magically increased. The character gains an additional Fatigue level each time you take this Quality. The new Fatigue levels are added in descending order, not counting Fresh or Unconscious, so that a character with 2 additional Fatigue levels has 2 Winded levels, 2 Weary levels, and 1 of each of the others. A character with 6 additional Fatigue levels would have 3 Winded and Weary levels, and 2 each of Tired and Dazed.

**Improved Initiative:** One of the character's natural weapons is magically enhanced, making it faster. Increase its Initiative value by 3. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Might:** Increase the character's Magic Might Score by 1. Note that this does not give a starting character additional Quality points to spend. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Powers:** The character is more skilled with its magical powers, making them more potent, activate faster, or cost fewer Might Points. This Quality gives the character 5 mastery points to spend on any of his powers, and each point can increase Initiative by 1, reduce the Might cost of a power by 1, or give the character 5 experience points in Concentration, Finesse, or Penetration. Also, a mastery point can increase the maximum level of a Focus Power by 5, so that it exceeds the character's Might. Personal, Lesser or Greater Powers can have a Might Point cost of 0; Ritual Powers have a minimum cost of (the effect's magnitude / 2, rounded up), and you cannot modify the cost of Focus Powers at all.

At the storyguide's discretion, this Quality can also be used to modify a power in the same way magi can master a Hermetic spell. Each time this Quality is taken, the character's mastery score with the power is increased by 1, and this gives the character a spell mastery special ability (such as those listed on page 87 of **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition). Note that activating powers does not require a die roll, so many of the typical benefits of mastering a spell (such as reduced botch dice) do not apply to mastered powers. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Recovery:** The character recovers Might Points in half the normal time. Instead of completely refreshing its Might over the course of 24 hours, the character restores its entire Might Pool in only 12 hours. A magical being with Magic Might 30 and this Quality would recover 1 Might Point approximately every 20 minutes. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Improved Soak:** The character's natural protection is magically enhanced, making it more effective at warding away blows and physical injury. Increase the character's Soak by 2. This Quality may be taken more than once.

**Lesser Power:** The character has 25 levels of powers designed like a formulaic spell. If this Quality is taken multiple times, these spell levels can be combined to allow for an effect of greater magnitude. These powers have a Might Point cost, which defaults to the magnitude of the effect, and Initiative for the power is equal to the character's Quickness – (the magnitude of the effect x 2). You should also note the Form or Forms of the effect, for the purposes of evaluating Magic Resistance.

Any spell levels that are left over after the Lesser Power is designed may be used to increase the effect level of other Lesser Powers, or converted into mastery points, with 5 full levels of effects equal to 1 mastery point. These may be spent like the mastery points gained from the Improved Powers Minor Quality on any of the character's Lesser Powers.

**Minor Virtue:** The character gains a Minor Virtue, usually either General or Supernatural (Magic), to represent an advantage of its magical nature. Note that while this Quality may be taken more than once, only Virtues that allow a character to take them multiple times may be duplicated. Also, if a Virtue has requirements or restrictions on the characters that may take it, the magic character must meet them. For example, only a magic character with The Gift (or the Gifted Virtue described below) can take Hermetic Virtues.

**Personal Power:** The character has a spell-like power, which is designed like a Greater Power (see Major Magic Qualities, above) except that the effect is limited in some way. The effect must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- The effect must be Range: Personal, OR
- The effect must be constant (see the Magic Powers sidebar, above).

Taking this Quality gives the character 25 levels to spend on these powers, which can be combined with the spell levels gained from taking this Quality more than once to allow for a power with a higher level.

Personal Powers have a Might Point cost equal to (the magnitude of the effect / 2), and an initiative score equal to the character's Quickness – (the magnitude of the effect / 2). You should also note the Form or Forms associated with the effect, for the purposes of evaluating Magic Resistance.

Any spell levels that are left over may be used to increase the effect level of other Personal Powers, or converted into mastery points, with 5 full levels of effects equal to 1 mastery point. These may be spent like the mastery points gained from the Improved Powers Minor Quality on any of the character's Personal Powers.

## *Major Magic Inferiorities*

**Acclimation Prone:** It is twice as difficult for the character to protect itself against Acclimation (see Acclimation, under Advancement, below). You must treat the character's Might Score as double its actual value when remaining in a Magic aura or accounting for pawns of vis consumed, and double the number of seasons necessary to avoid Acclimation with magical effects. For example, each year a character with Might 25 would need to remain in a level 10 aura, consume 25 pawns of vis, or participate in a constant magical effect all year to avoid losing one of its Magic Qualities to Acclimation.

**Major Flaw:** The character has a Major General or Supernatural (Magic) Flaw, which represents a disadvantage of its magical nature. This Inferiority may be taken more than once.

**Miniature:** The character has been magically shrunk in size, making it smaller and harder to catch, and much weaker than other beings of its type. It is otherwise exactly the same, simply on a reduced scale. This reduces the character's Size and Strength, and increases its Quickness, as shown on the chart below.

| Size S      | ize S<br>Decrease P | enalty B | trength Quickness<br>onus |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| –10 or less | –5                  | –10      | +5                        |
| –5 to –9    | –4                  | –8       | +4                        |
| –1 to –4    | –3                  | –6       | +3                        |
| +2 to 0     | –2                  | –4       | +2                        |
| +3 or more  | –1                  | –2       | +1                        |

If the character has Virtues or Flaws that modify its Size, or other Qualities or Inferiorities with a similar effect, you should always determine its base Characteristics first, and then apply the changes for Size in this order: Flaws, Inferiorities, Virtues, Qualities. For example, a Size 0 character with Str 0, Improved Characteristics, Large, and Miniature would first apply Improved Characteristics to raise its Str to +2, then Miniature to reduce Size to –2 and Str to –2, and finally Large for a final result of Size –1 and Str –2.

This Inferiority may be taken more than once. If it is taken more than once, the Inferiorities should be applied one at a time, and the reduction is based on the Size after the previ-

![](_page_40_Picture_27.jpeg)

ous Inferiorities have taken effect. For example, a base Size 0 character who took the Inferiority twice would drop to Size –2 from the first, and then by a further –3 from the second because his Size is now –2, to a final Size of –5.

**Monstrous Appearance:** Something about the character looks strange and frightening, be it horns, scales, sharp teeth, claws, an enormous head, double-jointed arms, unnaturally colored skin, or other supernatural features. These qualities give the character a –6 penalty in all social situations, or to any rolls involving the trust or loyalty of others. Most people will attack or run away from the character on sight, rather than engage it in conversation.

All Magic Humans have this Inferiority inherently, for no benefit.

**Reduced (Characteristic):** This reduces a Characteristic that is already –5 or less because of the Poor (Characteristic) Flaw by a further 1. This penalty is applied before the character's Strength and Quickness are adjusted for Size, so that a character with Size –1 and Strength –5 would have Strength –8. Also, this Inferiority cannot reduce a Characteristic any further than the inverse value of the character's greatest Characteristic, again before Size is applied, so that a Size +2 character with Stamina +8 could not reduce its Quickness below –10.

**Temporary Might:** The character does not replenish its Might Pool every day, but instead only recovers Might Points when resting in a Magic aura of no less than (its Might Score / 5), and at an extremely slow rate. It takes the character an entire season to recover all of its spent Might in this way, though like other magic characters it can still regain Might Points immediately by consuming vis: 5 Might Points for every pawn of vis associated with same Form as its Might, or 2 Might Points for every pawn of vis associated with any other Art.

When the character is injured, it loses Might Points equal to the penalty of the wound — a Light wound removes 1 Might Point, a Medium wound 3 Might Points, and a Heavy wound 5 Might Points. When incapacitated, it loses 5 Might Points. Each time the character is wounded, part of its body is separated from the rest, and these pieces contain some of the character's vis, a number of pawns equal to ((total Wound penalty / 5) – the number of pawns already lost). For example, a Light wound would separate a pawn of vis from the character, and produce another pawn after five more Light wounds.

All Magic Things have this Inferiority inherently, for no benefit.

## *Minor Magic Inferiorities*

**Limited Gestures:** This Inferiority is similar to the No Hands Flaw, except that the character can still grasp and manipulate objects with its appendages, just like characters with hands. Its control is limited, so that it cannot make more than vague gestures, and cannot wield a weapon with any degree of skill. Magi with this Inferiority suffer a –5 to all spellcasting totals, though this penalty may be offset by taking the Subtle Magic Virtue. (Magic Animals and characters with the No Hands or Arthritis Flaws cannot take this Inferiority.)

**Limited Movement:** The character can move and turn in place, and even move about freely within a limited area, such as in a room or on horseback, but is otherwise unable to transport itself further than short distances without assistance. Magic Things may take this Inferiority; cloaks slither, for example, tables could walk, and a sword jerks along the floor. It is impossible for a character with this Inferiority to carry itself further than about ten paces in an hour's time, even when pushing itself in a cart or trolley. (Characters with the Crippled or Lame Flaws cannot take this Inferiority.)

**Limited Speech:** The character cannot speak intelligibly, though it can make noises that allow it to gain attention, and can shape these sounds into words that may be understood with effort. The character is probably silent most of the time, and suffers a –3 to all Communication rolls when it does speak. Magi with this Inferiority suffer a –5 to all spellcasting totals, though the penalty may be offset with the Quiet Magic Virtue. (Characters with the Mute or Afflicted Tongue Flaws cannot take this Inferiority.)

**Minor Flaw:** The character has a Minor General or Supernatural (Magic) Flaw that represents a disadvantage of its magical nature. This Inferiority may be taken more than once.

**Reduced Abilities:** Subtract 50 experience points from the character's existing Abilities — this represents the fact that the character has somehow lost some of its memories or has magically reverted to an earlier stage of life. This Inferiority may be taken more than once, but you cannot take this Flaw unless the character has at least 50 experience points to lose.

**Reduced Attack:** One of the character's natural weapons has been magically worsened, making it less accurate and less likely to hit. Decrease its Attack bonus by 2. This Inferiority may be taken only if the character's Attack bonus for that weapon is greater than 0, though it can be taken more than once.

![](_page_41_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Reduced Defense:** One of the character's natural weapons has been magically weakened, making it less effective at blocking or dodging other attacks. Decrease its Defense bonus by 2. This Inferiority may be taken only if the character's Defense bonus for that weapon is greater than 0, though it can be taken more than once.

**Reduced Fatigue:** Each time you take this Inferiority, the character loses one of its Fatigue levels, removed in descending order and not counting Fresh or Unconscious. Thus, a normal character who takes this Inferiority twice would have only Tired and Dazed Fatigue levels. You cannot take it more than four times unless the character has extra Fatigue levels.

**Reduced Initiative:** One of the character's natural weapons has been magically slowed, making the character less able to act quickly. Decrease its Initiative bonus by 3. This Inferiority may be taken only if the character's Initiative bonus for that weapon is greater than 0, though it can be taken more than once.

**Reduced Might:** Decrease the character's Magic Might Score by 1. Note that this does not give a starting character fewer Quality points to spend. This Inferiority may be taken more than once.

**Reduced Power:** Subtract 5 mastery points from any of the character's powers. Each lost mastery point increases the number of Might Points spent to activate a power by 1, or subtracts 1 from the character's Initiative score for a power. This Inferiority may be taken more than once, but the activation cost for a power may not exceed the character's Might Score, and you cannot reduce a power's Initiative below 0.

**Reduced Soak:** The character's natural protection is magically weakened, making it more vulnerable to physical damage. Reduce the character's Soak by 2. This Inferiority may be taken only if the character's Soak is greater than 0, though it can be taken more than once.

**Susceptible to Deprivation:** Unlike other magical beings, the character cannot survive without air, food, or water, and suffers all the normal consequences when going without them. The character is still immune to aging, unless it has the Age Quickly Flaw.

## *Abilities, Virtues & Flaws*

Here are new and modified Supernatural Abilities, Virtues and Flaws that characters can choose from when designing magic characters or characters that are somehow associated with the realm of Magic.

Unless otherwise noted, all of the Supernatural Virtues and Flaws described below are always associated with the Magic realm, and cannot be used with any other realm of power (with the possible exception of False Powers from *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, see pages 88-89 of that book).

## *New & Modified Virtues*

**Atlantean Magic**

*Minor, Hermetic*

The magus, or an ancestor in his lineage, has studied the magic of exiled Atlanteans and has developed several useful extensions to Hermetic magic. The magus has access to a special Range: Water-way, a special Duration: Storm, and a special Target: Body-ofwater, that he may utilize with Spontaneous magic and in Formulaic or Ritual spells.

**Water-way** *(Range)***:** The magus can target anyone, or anything, on (or in) the same water-way as him. For example, a river, or canal, or lake, or sea is a water-way. Tributary streams of a river are the same water-way as the main river, but are *not* the same water-way as other tributaries to the main river. In some cases the troupe will need to decide precisely where one water-way begins, and another ends.

The magus must touch the water-way, when casting the spell, and the target must be either also touching the water-way or floating on it (in a boat, for example). A person on the bank of a river cannot be targeted by this spell. The magus need not be able to see the target, but he must be able to sense it in some way, unless the spell is an Intellego effect intended to determine whether something is in the water-way.

For determining the spell level, waterway is the same range of effect as Sight.

**Storm** *(Duration)***:** A spell with this duration must be cast during a storm and lasts until the end of the storm. Normally, a storm lasts a number of minutes or hours, but some large storms may last for days. The form of the spell must be either Aquam or Auram, but the spell is not necessarily cast on the storm itself.

The length of an entirely natural storm can be quickly estimated by rolling a stress die and dividing the result by 2 — this gives the number of hours that the storm will last. A botch has no consequence, excepting that the storm will dissipate in a number of minutes. The storyguide should secretly determine how long the storm will last — although an InAu spell, or Wilderness Sense Ability Roll could easily reveal this information.

For determining the spell level, Storm is the same duration as Concentration.

**Body-of-water** *(Target)***:** A spell with this target targets an entire body-of-water, whether this is a lake, a river, or a sea. Use the same guidelines as water-way to determine where a body-of-water begins and ends.

For determining the spell level, body-ofwater is the same level of Target as Structure (remember to increase the spell magnitude to effect a very large body-of-water, like a sea or the ocean).

#### **Composer of Power**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character is a recognized composer of magical music. This means that he can teach songs of power to other characters. Such a song allows the character that learns it to replicate the effect of a single Power that the composer character knows, by expending vis of the appropriate Form equal to (1 + the Might Point cost of the Power). For example, a bird that is taught to sing *Call the Flock* must expend 3 Animal vis each time that it sings the song.

In a season, the character can teach a single song to a number of characers equal to his Leadership Ability score, and the students only retain the ability to sing the song for a year.

**Essential Virtue** *Major or Minor, General*

The character receives one generally beneficial Essential Trait at either +3 for Minor or +6 for Major, which either positively affects rolls associated with a particular Characteristic in certain situations, like Intuitive +3 or Good Aim +6, or gives the character a beneficial Personality Trait that is part of its essential nature and cannot be influenced by magic (see Essential Traits, below).

You can take this Virtue more than once, so long as you choose a different Essential Trait each time.

#### **Extractor of (Form) Vis**

*Minor, Hermetic*

The magus can extract (Form) vis from a Magic aura, but only if the features of the aura exemplify the Form. For example, an aura on the shores of a lake might exemplify Aquam, an aura at a burial-site exemplifies Corpus, etc. Extracting vis in this way is a Laboratory activity; the magus extracts a number of pawns of Vis equal to a tenth of his Creo Vim (Form) Lab Total (round up). Obviously, he needs to have a Laboratory in the aura too, and of course, the magus can chose to extract Vim vis instead (see **ArM5**, page 91). This Virtue may be taken multiple times (once for each Form).

#### **Ferocity**

*Minor, General*

This Virtue may only be taken by magic characters played as grogs, or who do not have Intelligence, or who have the Low Self-Esteem Flaw.

The character has Confidence Points, like a magus or companion character, but you may only use these Confidence Points in certain situations where the character's natural ferocity is triggered. Describe the circumstance that activates the character's Confidence, and take three Points to use when those conditions are met.

## *Possible Abuses of Storms*

A ReAu spell with Storm duration intended to "keep a storm raging" will *not* result in a storm that lasts indefinitely. It will keep the storm raging for whatever its original life-time was. A ReAu spell with a duration of Sun, for example, can be used to keep to a storm raging for a day, of course, and repeated castings of such a spell will keep the storm present until the caster gives up.

Similarly, a CrAu spell with Storm duration will *not* create a storm lasts indefinitely. It merely creates a storm that lasts for the duration of whatever storm existed prior to the casting of the spell. That is, if no storm previously existed this spell will have no effect. A CrAu spell with a duration of Storm cast on an existing storm will however help to prevent the storm from being dissipated by PeAu effects before it should naturally expire. A CrAu spell with a duration of Sun can be used to create a storm with a duration of a day, of course.

#### **Focus Power**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character has a magical power activated at will. This is designed like a Focus Power, as described under Major Magic Qualities, but since the character does not have a Might Score the calculation of maximum level of effect and Penetration is different.

This Virtue grants a pool of 25 points. The maximum level of effect and Penetration both start at zero. It costs 2 points to raise the maximum level of effect by 1, and 1 point to raise the Penetration by 1. Thus, 25 points can allow a maximum level of 10 with a Penetration of 5, or a maximum level of 5 with a Penetration of 15, or combinations in between.

It costs a number of Fatigue levels to activate this power equal to (the power's Might Point cost divided by 5, rounded up). This means it is always at least one Fatigue level, and if the effect is greater than level 25, it costs two Fatigue levels.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the points gained may be combined.

#### **Giant Blood**

*Major, General*

(See the Virtue on page 43 of **ArM5**.)

This Virtue represents a character with both the blood of giants and the blood of humans in his lineage, not a true giant. Full-blooded giant characters use the rules for magic humans, taking the Major Magic Quality Gigantic during character creation.

#### **Greater Immunity (Deprivation)**

*Major, Supernatural*

(See the Virtue on **ArM5**, page 43.)

Much like magical beings, the character is immune to deprivation, suffering no loss of Fatigue or wounds from going without air, food or drink. However, like magic characters, she cannot regain long-term Fatigue without rest and sustenance, and if she is injured deprivation could cause her wounds to worsen.

#### **Greater Power**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character has a magical power that he can activate at will. This is designed like a Greater Power as described under Major Qualities above, but since the character does not have a Might Score, it costs him a number of Fatigue levels to activate equal to (the power's Might Point cost divided by 5, rounded up). This Virtue may be taken more than once. You may trade in levels for Mastery Points, as normal, and use them to reduce the Might Point cost, and thus Fatigue cost. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero, as the character has no Might Score.

![](_page_43_Picture_55.jpeg)

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character always knows precisely how to get from where they are to a number of locations equal to her Intelligence Score (a minimum of 1). To add a location to the character's repertoire she must be at that location, the location must be open to the air (so it cannot be inside, for example), and the player must make an Intelligence + Concentration Roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If this would increase the number of known locations beyond the character's limit, then another location must be "forgotten."

For example, all Birds of Nephelococcygia (see Chapter 5: Magic Animals) know the location of Nephelococcygia, and this location cannot be "forgotten." In addition, the character has a fixed Arcane Connection to locations that she knows, which may be exploited in the usual ways (see **ArM5**, page 84). This Arcane Connection is an artifact of the mind, and so may not be given to another character.

#### **Imbued with the Spirit of (Form)**

*Minor, Hermetic*

The magus has absorbed some of the powers of an elemental or other magic object (perhaps by consuming it). This act taints the magus, so that any being with a Magic Might associated with the Form of this Virtue can sense his nature when nearby. Typically, weak creatures will be afraid of the magus and powerful ones will attempt to kill him.

Whenever casting a spell or performing a Laboratory Activity that requires vis of the chosen Form, the magus may substitute Long-Term Fatigue Levels for the vis. Each Long-Term Fatigue Level lost reduces the vis requirement of the spell or effect by 1. When casting a spell the Fatigue Levels are lost *after* the spell is cast. For Laboratory Activities the Fatigue loss lasts for the duration of the Laboratory process (that is, at least a season), and Fatigue Levels substituted for vis do not count towards the magi's limit of vis expenditure in a season.

Note that studying vis is not a Laboratory activity, so the magus may not substitute Fatigue Levels for vis when studying.

For example, a magus casting an *Enchantment of the Scrying Pool* ritual (InAq 30, **ArM5**, page 122), requires 6 pawns of some combination of Intellego and Aquam vis. If the magus is Imbued with the Spirit of Aquam, he may tire himself (losing three Long Term Fatigue Levels), and reduce the vis requirement by 3.

![](_page_43_Picture_65.jpeg)

**Inoffensive to (Beings)**

*Minor, General*

Only characters with The Gift or an inherent Magical Air may take this Virtue.

The character's magical presence does not disturb a single type of being: animals, spirits, or those aligned with the Magic realm.

This Virtue may not be taken more than once; to design a character that is not disturbing to more than one sort of being, instead take the Gentle Gift and the Offensive to (Beings) Flaw, below.

#### **(Land) Regio Network**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character has access to an extensive network of regiones, perhaps located in the depths of many lakes throughout Mythic Europe, or hidden above the clouds in the sky, or buried in subterranean caves under the ground. The character is associated with one particular type of regio network.

Once the character is in such a regio he may travel to any other regio in the network; travel time is one Diameter regardless of geographic distance. To determine whether the character knows the location of a networked regio in a particular locale an Intelligence + (Area) Lore roll is made against an Ease Factor of 9. The character knows how to enter these regiones and can, if he chooses, guide other characters into the regiones — although other characters must be able to survive in the environment of the regio.

Access to the network may be ultimately controlled by other characters or powers.

#### **Large**

*Minor, General*

(See the Virtue on page 44 of **ArM5**.)

This Virtue changes a magic character's Size, but does not modify Strength or Quickness.

#### **Lesser Power**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character has a power which is limited in some way, designed as a Lesser power described under Minor Magical Qualities, above. Activating it costs the character a number of Fatigue levels equal to (the power's Might cost divided by 5, rounded up). This Virtue may be taken more than once. You may trade in levels for Mastery Points, as normal, and use them to reduce the Might Point cost, and thus Fatigue cost. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero, as the character has no Might Score.

![](_page_44_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Magic Animal**

*Special*

The character is a magical animal, either a perfect example of its species that is generally known as a Beast of Virtue, or else some other sort of magical being born in an animal shape. It is designed using the Magical Animal rules for Magic Character Creation, above, which gives it a Magic Might Score and other advantages over mundane creatures. It must also deal with the innate limitations of an animal form, such as having no hands. Subtract the character's natural Size from its starting Might Score.

#### **Magic Human**

*Special*

The character is a magical human, maybe descended from an ancient race of magical beings or somehow blessed with magic in his blood, born with a Magic Might Score and the Monstrous Appearance Inferiority (though he is not necessarily ugly). He should be designed using the Magic Human rules for Magic Character Creation, above.

**Magic Spirit** *Special*

The character is a mind, memory, image or idea somehow brought to life by the power of Magic. It is designed with a Magic Might Score according to the Magical Spirit rules for Magic Character Creation, above. Such characters are insubstantial and always have the Magical Air Flaw, as if they possessed The Gift, and only a Gentle Magical Air can lessen this effect. If the character has the Gifted Quality, this gives the character a Blatant Magical Air instead.

#### **Magic Thing**

*Special*

The character is a magical thing made up of elemental atoms or possessed by the raw power of nature, something that gives it a semblance of life and provides it with a Magic Might Score. Magical beings of this sort always have the Magic Inferiority of Temporary Might, which means that it takes them a very long time to recover their spent Might Points, and whenever they are injured, some of their Might is separated from their physical bodies as vis. They also receive the No Fatigue Quality at no cost. They should be designed according to the Magic Thing rules for Magic Character Creation.

![](_page_44_Picture_29.jpeg)

![](_page_45_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character's essential nature has been improved through exposure to the Magic realm, often from a magic being, which gives her true form special supernatural properties. This typically changes the character's appearance enough that others can recognize that there is something unusual about her, and people might say that she has magical blood — or "faerie blood" (since many people in Mythic Europe do not understand the differences between the Magic and Faerie realms).

The character may learn Magic Lore during character creation, and is resistant to aging, receiving a –1 bonus to all of her Aging rolls. In addition, she receives a minor physical advantage appropriate to one of the four different types of magic beings (magic animals, magic humans, magic spirits, and magic things), the one that is associated with the character's background. Some examples are below, or you can make up your own.

**Magic Animal:** The character has a physical feature normally associated with animals, such as wings, scales, gills, teeth, or claws. These give as much as a +3 bonus to appropriate activities, or may allow the character to perform actions that a normal character could not manage (such as fly, or breathe underwater). This feature is very difficult to hide, making the character obviously different from other humans.

**Magic Human:** The character may increase one of his Characteristics by 1, but not above +3. This is often Strength or Stamina (to represent the blood of giant ancestors), or Presence (to represent the blood of godlike beings). This often gives the character an otherworldly appearance. The character also has a positive Reputation at level 3 among others of his bloodline.

**Magic Spirit:** The character gains an appropriate Supernatural Ability (one associated with a Minor Virtue), such as Magic Sensitivity, Premonitions, Second Sight, or Wilderness Sense, with an initial score of 1, though whenever the character uses this Ability, her appearance becomes obviously supernatural. For example, her eyes might turn black, she might rise a foot from the ground, or her hair might be blown about by a wind no one else can feel.

**Magic Thing:** The character has a Lesser Power associated with an object or thing. Whenever she activates the effect, her appearance also changes in a way appropriate to the form of the power. For example, a power that protects against flames would cause her skin to become dark with soot and smell like smoke, and a power that lets her walk on water might cause her to become semi-transparent, like water.

#### **Magical Champion**

*Minor, Social Status*

Only characters designed using the rules for Magic Character Creation may take this Virtue.

A small group of individuals considers the character to be their particular representative, by virtue of its magical nature. They might be the grogs at the covenant, or all the animals in a single pack, or all the magical trees in a particular forest. These beings give the character special respect, and so others typically recognize and deal with the character as the leader of the group. Outside of this group, the character does not command any special respect because of its magical nature; if it looks human it will be treated like a person, otherwise it will probably be perceived as either a dumb beast or a monster.

This Virtue may be combined with other Social Status Virtues and Flaws that are appropriate to the character's form.

#### **Magical Covenfolk**

*Free, Social Status*

Only characters designed using the rules for Magic Character Creation may take this Virtue.

The character is a magical being that is generally accepted by the other people at the covenant as an equal. The character does not command any special respect because of its magical nature, however, and how outsiders treat it depends upon its appearance; if it looks human it will be treated like a person, otherwise it will be seen as either a dumb beast or a monster.

This Virtue may be combined with other Social Status Virtues and Flaws that are appropriate to the character's form.

#### **Magical Master**

*Major, Social Status*

Only characters designed using the rules for Magic Character Creation may take this Virtue.

The character is recognized as a higher power by a relatively large group, and this status depends on its magical nature. This group might be everyone in a particular village or covenant, or all the animals in a single forest, or all of the trees of a particular variety in Mythic Europe. There is something about the character's powers or physical appearance that allows members of the group to easily recognize the character. Members of this special group generally defer to the character, and perhaps even worship or venerate it depending on their sophistication and beliefs. Outside of this community, the character does not command any special respect; if it looks human it will be treated like a person, otherwise it will probably be perceived as either a dumb beast or a monster.

This Virtue may be combined with other Social Status Virtues and Flaws that are appropriate to the character's form.

#### **Magical Mount**

*Minor, General*

The character has a mount, beast-ofburden, or "guard dog," a creature that has Cunning instead of Intelligence and a Magic Might Score of up to 25. It has an extra Personality Trait (Loyal 0) and will obey simple verbal commands. If it has a positive Cunning score, the creature is also able to perform limited acts on its own initiative. If the character is incapable of training the creature himself, it must have been a gift from another character (probably a powerful magus) and the character must take the Major Story Flaw: Favors, to represent his debt to his patron — in this case, only a companion or magus-level character can take this Virtue.

#### **Magical Warder**

*Major, General*

The character has a magical being that accompanies him, watches over him, and sees that he comes to no harm. It does not require anything from the character in return for its service, but note that the more powerful the warder, the less willing or able it is to help the character, and the less often it is available to protect him. Design this being as a magic character — a Ghostly Warder is a good example of a companion character; less powerful and it is basically an extension of the character's will, while a more powerful Warder's assistance is rarer and even more circumstantial.

(Besides enabling other sorts of warders, this version of the Virtue makes it possible to take a Ghostly Warder designed with a Might Score that is more appropriate to the power level of the saga and the character's role within it.)

#### **Master of (Form) Creatures**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character can tame animals and other unintelligent beings whose Magic Might is aligned with a particular Form. During character creation, the character may take Magic Lore, and this Virtue may be taken multiple times, once for each Form.

![](_page_45_Picture_36.jpeg)

![](_page_46_Picture_0.jpeg)

![](_page_46_Picture_1.jpeg)

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character has a power which is limited in some way, designed as a Personal power described under Minor Magical Qualities, above. Activating it costs the character a number of Fatigue levels equal to (the power's Might cost divided by 5, rounded up). This Virtue may be taken more than once. You may trade in levels for Mastery Points, as normal, and use them to reduce the Might Point cost, and thus Fatigue cost. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero, as the character has no Might Score. If the Power has a range of Personal, it does not need Penetration, as it can affect the character without needing to penetrate.

#### **Ritual Power**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character has a magical power that he can activate at will. This is designed like a Ritual Power as described under Major Qualities above, but since the character does not have a Might Score, activating it always costs him a number of Fatigue levels equal to (the effect's Might Point cost divided by 5, rounded up). In addition, activating the power costs a number of Confidence Points equal to the Might Point cost of the power. This Virtue may be taken more than once. You may trade in levels for Mastery Points, as normal, and use them to reduce the Might Point cost, and thus Fatigue cost. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero, as the character has no Might Score.

#### **Transformed (Being)**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character has been transformed by the power of Magic, losing his mundane nature and changing into a supernatural being — see the Special Virtues Magic Animal, Magic Human, Magic Spirit, or Magic Thing, above, for examples of how Magic changes a character.

Initially the character has a Might Score of 0 and no Magic Qualities, though the player may take a number of Magic Inferiorities equal to his maximum allotment of Flaws during this transformation — three points for a grog character, and ten for a magus or companion — and gaining a corresponding number of Magic Qualities. The magic character also gains an Essential Trait at +3 that describes the character's origin or true form, what the character is at a fundamental level. This should be related to the Form of the character's Might in some way.

Characters with a Might Score associated with any realm of power other than Magic cannot take this Virtue. If the character has Supernatural Virtues or Flaws associated with other realms, these are also affected by the transformation. Generally, divine powers are lost, faerie powers become magic ones, and infernal powers become magic but tainted with evil (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal* for more information about tainted powers). For example, a character's Strong Faerie Blood might become a Greater Power, infernal Entrancement would become magical but would be infernally tainted, and True Faith would be gone forever.

#### **Unaffected by The Gift**

*Minor, General*

The character is not affected by the negative effects of The Gift or Magical Air in others. Even a Blatant Gift does not especially bother the character.

#### **Variable Power**

*Minor, Supernatural*

One of the character's magic powers (Greater, Lesser, or Ritual) becomes more powerful over time, based on either (age / 10), (Might Score / 5), Warping Score, or his score in an appropriate Ability. (Age and Warping should not be allowed as variables if the character is immune to their effects.) For example, an effect that allows the character to change his shape into an animal might be associated with a special Ability, and his score in that Ability would determine how many different animals he could become.

Generally speaking, a single power can have its effect level increased by five, or include another effect of the same level that is similar the original, for each level of variance. For a character with Variable Powers based on his age, for example, this would mean the effectiveness of one of his powers would be increased by a total of five magnitudes after he has lived for 50 years.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, if the character has more than one power, but it only applies once to a single power.

#### **Voice of the (Land)**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character can speak with any creature whose natural habitat is a particular environment associated with this Virtue (including animals and magic beings), and the character is not normally perceived as either a threat or a prey object by these creatures.

## *New & Modified Flaws*

**Anchored to the (Land)**

*Minor, General*

The character suffers from feelings of loneliness and depression when she cannot see or hear a particular type of environment. In game terms, the character has a –3 penalty to all rolls when traveling through any other sort of environment (it is assumed that once the character has time to recover from the journey, she will find some reminder of her natural environment to help her rest). For example, a character who is Anchored to the Sea would suffer the penalty when traveling overland, but once settled can easily comfort herself — with the sound of the sea heard in a sea shell, perhaps.

#### **Age Quickly**

*Major, Supernatural*

(See the Flaw on page 51 of **ArM5**.)

If this Flaw is taken by a character with a Magic Might Score, or by a character who later gains a Magic Might Score, the character is not immune to aging like other magic characters, but only has to roll for aging once a year. For these characters, this aging cannot be halted with a longevity ritual as it is already slowed by their magical natures.

#### **Baneful Circumstances**

*Minor, Supernatural*

Something about the character's supernatural nature weakens him in relatively common circumstances, such as when touching the ground or when in the presence of women. At these times, the character cannot recover Fatigue, heal wounds, or recover Might, and if at the end of the year the character has spent more than half of his time subject to these conditions, he must make an additional Aging roll even if he is normally immune to aging because of a longevity ritual or Might Score.

#### **Blatant Magical Air**

*Major, Supernatural*

Only characters with a Magical Air or The Gift may take this Flaw.

The character is especially disturbing to others, so much that they can barely tolerate its presence. The character suffers a –6 penalty to social actions, and is immediately hated and feared by members of the mundane population. This effect is the same as the Blatant Gift, and a character may not have both Flaws.

![](_page_46_Picture_39.jpeg)

![](_page_47_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Bound to Magic**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character is no longer able to survive in the mundane world, and sickens if it is outside a Magic aura for an extended period of time. The character must live in a Magic aura of 5 or greater to remain healthy; if it spends most of a season outside such an aura, make a Stamina Roll against an Ease Factor of (9 – Size). If you fail the roll, the character sustains a Heavy wound, unless the previous season it also failed such a roll, in which case it sustains an Incapacitating wound instead.

Other versions of this Flaw may exist for the other supernatural realms.

(This Flaw is especially appropriate for animals that have been Warped by Magic; see Chapter 5: Magic Animals, Transformed Animals.)

#### **Deteriorating Power**

*Minor, Supernatural*

Like the Variable Powers Virtue, this Flaw reduces the effectiveness of one of the character's powers (Greater, Lesser, or Ritual) over time. This penalty is linked to either the character's (age / 10), (Might Score – Might Pool / 5), or Warping Score. For example, a magic character with Deteriorating Powers linked to Might and a Might Score of 25 would have one of his powers reduced by 5 magnitudes when his Might Pool is empty.

This Flaw may be taken more than once, if the character has more than one Power.

#### **Dwarf**

*Major, General*

(See the Flaw on page 53 of **ArM5**.)

This Flaw represents a human being who is born much smaller than average, but who is still mundane. For a character of magically reduced Size, take the Miniature Inferiority instead.

#### **Environmental Magic Condition** *Major, Hermetic*

All of the character's Casting and Lab Totals are halved in certain common conditions related to his environment. For example, whenever he is inside. Note that this should be significantly more restrictive than the Hermetic Flaw Deleterious Circumstances (**ArM5** page 53).

#### **Environmental Sensitivity**

*Minor, General*

The character is unusually sensitive to an uncommon environmental feature, such as bad air, salt water, or extreme temperatures. Whenever the character is exposed to these conditions, he has a –3 penalty to his Stamina for any debilitation checks (see **ArM5,** page 180).

#### **Essential Flaw**

*Major or Minor, General*

This Flaw gives the character an Essential Trait that negatively affects rolls associated with one of his Characteristics in a particular situation, such as Poor Runner, Face Curdles Milk, or Stutter, with a starting score of –3 if Minor, or –6 if Major. The effects of this Flaw are always detrimental to the character. Magical powers cannot help you overcome this limitation because it is part of your essential nature (see Essential Traits, later in this chapter).

You can take this Flaw more than once, but only affecting a different Characteristic each time.

#### **Exiled Atlantean**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character is an exiled Atlantean; she is tainted by her contact with the surface world, and cannot return to her magic regio. This exile is enforced by the very nature of the magic regio to which the Atlanteans are native, so there is no authority figure to which she may appeal, or any obvious method of returning to favor. The exile applies even if the Atlantean left her native magic regio involuntarily.

#### **(Form) Monstrosity**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character is a monstrosity with a monstrous feature, or mutation, which corresponds to a magical Form. The feature may be beneficial in limited circumstances, but generally gives the character no advantage over its non-mutated peers.

Animals are not usually bothered by monsters — the character still has the correct scent, and behavior — and a single monstrous bull might be found happily living among a herd of otherwise normal cattle, for example. People, on the other hand, are highly troubled by the appearance of monstrosities, which they invariably attribute to malign influence; obviously monstrous animals are usually killed by peasants. Often, 1 pawn of Muto vis may be extracted from the corpse of a monstrous character, found concentrated in the monstrous feature.

Some examples of possible monstrosities are listed below, but the troupe may devise their own, as required:

![](_page_47_Picture_34.jpeg)

![](_page_48_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Aquam** gills, or webbing on land animals **Auram** wings on a land or sea animal **Corpus** human-like limbs or eyes

**Herbam** a branch for a tail

**Ignem** fiery breath, or an extremely

elevated body temperature

**Imaginem** unnatural hide (tiger fur on a

horse, for example)

**Mentem** sensitivity to spirits (animal can

both sense and is afraid of spirits)

**Terram** teeth or claws of stone

**Vim** sensitive to magic (animal feels pain when in a magical aura)

(This Flaw is especially appropriate for animals Warped by Magic; see Chapter 5: Magic Animals, Transformed Animals.)

#### **Hunger for (Form) Magic**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character has been repeatedly exposed to magic and has thus become dependent upon magic to survive. The character must consume 1 pawn of vis each season, corresponding to the Form that it has been mostly exposed to. If the character is unable to consume a pawn of vis in a season, it loses a Long-Term Fatigue Level that cannot be regained until a pawn of the appropriate vis is consumed. For example, a character that has Hunger for Ignem Magic and has not consumed a pawn of Ignem vis for a whole year will have lost 4 Long-Term Fatigue Levels, and so be Dazed with a –5 penalty to activities. If the character then consumes 1 pawn of Ignem vis, it will regain a Fatigue Level and become Tired after an hour has elapsed.

(This Flaw is especially appropriate for animals that have been Warped by Magic; see Chapter 5: Magic Animals, Transformed Animals.)

#### **Magic (Being) Companion**

*Minor, Story*

The character is accompanied by an intelligent magical being, one that is smart enough to follow orders or disobey them on its own initiative, which the character must regularly look after. This might be an animal, a spirit, a human-like creature, or even an animate object. Design this being as a magic character with the Magical Friend Social Status Flaw (see below), and note that the greater the character's Might Score, the more independent it will be. A grog-level character might be essentially an extension of the character's will, while a companion-level character might follow instructions but often do what it thinks

is best, and a magus-level character might be condescending or wild, and rarely act except on its own initiative.

(Besides enabling other sorts of magical companions, this version of the Flaw makes it possible to take a Magical Animal Companion designed with a Might Score that is more appropriate to the power level of the saga and the character's role within it.)

#### **Magical Friend**

*Minor, Social Status*

Only characters designed using the rules for Magic Character Creation may take this Flaw.

Like a Magical Monster, the character is considered to be less than human, but favored by one or more human characters (or other characters that are generally accepted as human). Among people who know the character's associate, the character is treated better than it would otherwise be, perhaps as that person's pet or bodyguard. Others most likely treat the character as an outsider or a brute, or perhaps as a dumb beast or a monster.

This Flaw is intended as the counterpart to another character's Magical (Being) Companion, but it is also particularly appropriate for Hermetic familiars or any characters with nonhuman forms that are strongly associated with someone at a covenant. Characters created to be Magical Companions cannot themselves have Magical Companion characters.

#### **Magical Monster**

*Major, Social Status*

Only characters designed using the rules for Magic Character Creation may take this Flaw.

The character is a magical being that has no strong connection to human society, such as a person who looks after it or a community that accords it special respect. Generally people treat it as an outsider if it appears human, or as a beast if it does not. The character might know how to interact with human beings, and might even be good at it, but even a well-spoken and social Magical Monster will never be treated as a person based on its own merits.

#### **Monstrous Blood**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character's essential nature has been changed through exposure to the Magic realm, often because of a relationship to a magic being, which gives her true form unfortunate supernatural properties. This changes the character's appearance enough that others can immediately recognize that there is something wrong about her, and people might say that she has tainted blood. The character is more resistant to age and receives a –1 bonus to all Aging rolls, and may learn Magic Lore during character creation.

However, the character also gains a minor physical deformity appropriate to the

![](_page_48_Picture_49.jpeg)

magic being type that is associated with the character's background. Some examples are below, or you can make up your own.

**Magic Animal:** The character has a physical feature normally associated with animals, such as wings, scales, gills, sharp teeth, or claws. These are not usable by the character, and give a –3 penalty to appropriate activities (such as running or climbing) as these deformities get in the way.

**Magic Human:** The character must decrease one of his Characteristics by 1, but not below –3. This might be Strength or Stamina to represent weakened blood, or Presence to indicate a dowdy appearance. The character also has a poor Reputation of level 3 among other magic beings.

**Magic Spirit:** The character has a mental block against many activities that are not supernatural, possibly due to a noticeable difficulty with retaining memories. Subtract 3 from all of the character's Intelligence and Perception rolls that do not involve a Supernatural Ability or Art.

**Magic Thing:** The character has a constant Lesser Power that is mostly detrimental to it in some way, such as a ward that prevents it from picking up wooden objects, or that causes books it touches to burst into flame. The effect normally occurs involuntarily, but the character can spend a Confidence Point to prevent it from triggering.

#### **Offensive to (Beings)**

*Minor, General*

The character has a magical presence very similar to The Gift that is especially disturbing to a particular type of creature: animals, spirits, or characters aligned with Magic. Only characters who are not Gifted (or whose Gift does not affect others) may take this Flaw.

#### **Poor Concentration**

*Minor, General*

While the character may have a mind that is quick to make decisions, he has a short attention span. The character has a –3 penalty to Concentration rolls.

#### **Restricted Power**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The character must perform some special ceremony to activate one of its powers, such as drawing symbols on the ground or gesturing and chanting like a magus, or else the power only functions on a limited class of targets (such as men, wolves, sounds, or sand) or in specific circumstances (like at night, under water, when touching iron, or after singing a song). This Flaw may be taken once for each power the character possesses.

**Servant of the (Land)**

*Major, Story*

Some powerful magical creature has saved the character from death and in return the character has been set a task. Possible tasks include: preaching a message, operating a lighthouse, or preventing hunting in a certain area. Usually the task is either difficult or time-consuming, and while it remains incomplete the character has the Minor Personality Flaw: Prohibition (**ArM5**, page 58), but this does not count toward the character's total number of Virtues and Flaws. The Prohibition means that if the character does not spend at least one complete season every year working toward his assigned task, a curse afflicts him. Possible curses include: a magical compulsion to return to the land where the character must explain himself to his master, turning into an animal, or acquiring a Supernatural Flaw.

#### **Slow Power**

*Minor, Supernatural*

One of the character's powers is very slow, so that it requires an additional round of preparation to activate. This Flaw may be taken more than once, if the character has multiple powers, but not more than once for a single power.

#### **Small Frame**

*Minor, General*

(See the Flaw on page 59 of **ArM5**.)

This Flaw changes a magic character's Size, but does not modify its Strength or Quickness.

#### **Wanderlust**

*Major, Story*

The character feels compelled to travel with a passion that is so strong that he cannot spend more than a season in the same place. The character can only spend two (nonconsecutive) seasons each year in the same Magic aura, and must spend the intervening seasons traveling to different locales — places he has never been. If for some reason he cannot travel, he will become very uncomfortable; this could manifest in many appropriate ways, such as being unable to spend or gain Confidence Points or restore Might Points until he leaves.

#### **Warped Senses**

*Minor, Personality*

The character has become overly sensitive to environmental conditions, which affects his behavior in certain uncommon circumstances. Some examples include:

**Sensitive (Sense):** One of your senses is so sensitive that it is overwhelmed under circumstances that others find normal. If it is sight, normal daylight dazzles you. If it is hearing, sounds above normal speaking volume hurt your ears. If it is taste, only bland food is tolerable. If it is smell, strong odors, good or bad, are nauseating. You suffer a –2 penalty on all activities under relevant circumstances. (It is inadvisable to combine Sensitive Sight with Keen Vision, and Sensitive Hearing with Sharp Ears, and these are incompatible with Blind and Deaf, respectively.)

**Weak (Sense):** One of your senses is so weak that it is useless under circumstances that others find normal. If it is sight, you can only see well in good illumination (e.g. broad daylight). If it is hearing, you can only hear sounds above normal speaking volume. If taste, only highly flavored food is palatable. If smell, you can only detect strong odors. You suffer a –2 penalty on all activities under relevant circumstances. (Weak Sight is incompatible with Sensitive Sight, Keen Vision, and Blind and you cannot take Weak Hearing with Sensitive Hearing, Sharp Ears, or Deaf.)

**Sensitive to Cold:** You function normally at temperatures considerably above the norm for your part of the world. You lose 1 Fatigue level for every hour you spend in an environment two steps or more below your accustomed conditions on the Environmental Temperatures chart (see sidebar). Your responses to heat are reduced in intensity by 2 (see **ArM5**, page 181).

**Sensitive to Heat:** You function normally at temperatures considerably below the norm for your part of the world. You lose 1

## *Environmental Temperatures*

- Unnaturally hot
- As hot as being next to a raging fire, molten lava, or molten iron
- Tropical mid-day
- As warm as a fine summer's day in southern Europe
- Comfortable for a normal inhabitant of the Normandy, Rhine, Stonehenge, and Hibernia Tribunals
- As cold as a chilly winter's day in Western Europe
- Arctic winter
- Unnaturally cold

![](_page_49_Picture_46.jpeg)

![](_page_50_Picture_1.jpeg)

Fatigue level for every hour you spend in an environment two steps or more above your habituated conditions on the Environmental Temperatures chart (see sidebar). Your response to ice is reduced in intensity to 0 (see **ArM5**, page 181).

This is a common Flaw for characters who become Warped by a strong magic environment (see Chapter 2: Auras, Aligned Auras).

## *New & Modified Abilities*

**Animal Handling**

Besides being able to train and take care of animals (as described in **ArM5**, page 62), you can apply the same principles when interacting with other beings that have Cunning instead of Intelligence. For example, with this Ability you can manage and train elementals, animate trees, or animal spirits.

**Specialties:** magical beings associated with a particular form, a type of magic being (magic spirits, magic things), a specific sort of handling (training Abilities, inspiring loyalty). (General)

**(Form) Resistance\***

Only characters with a Magic Might Score can possess this Ability.

Through exposure to a particular magical Form, the character has developed a natural resistance to things associated with that Form, in the same way that magi become more resistant by studying the magic of the associated Hermetic Form. You may add the character's score in this Ability as a bonus to attempts to resist damage from things of that Form (as described in the examples on pages 78-79 of **ArM5**). For example, you may add your score in Vim Resistance to rolls to resist Agitation and to your soak total against damage inflicted by your own magical powers.

Like Form bonuses for magi, this also increases a magic character's Magic Resistance against spells of that Form, but this is only compatible with Magic Might; it does not stack with the Parma Magica.

**Specialties:** a single source of damage inflicted by that Form. (Supernatural)

**Magical Meditation\***

Only characters with a Magic Might Score can possess this Ability.

By concentrating, the character enters a trance-like state in which it can absorb magic from its surroundings at an increased rate. This has two effects.

## *Social Abilities and Magical Beings*

When a person becomes a magical being, it ceases to be human, and so some social Abilities are no longer useful for describing its behavior or motivations. The same principle applies to social skills that deal with training animals and other unintelligent beings, since when they become magical they often also become intelligent (see Chapter 5: Magical Animals, Training).

Here is a summary of how different Abilities apply to magical beings.

**Animal Handling:** This Ability is useful for knowing how to take care of a being with an animal form, though not for social interactions with an intelligent animal. To predict how such an animal might respond or behave, use Magic Lore. As noted above, this Ability may also be used to manage other unintelligent beings.

**Animal Ken:** This is a Supernatural Ability with an effect that allows communication with any animal, magical or not, but does not affect other sorts of beings. It does not give any special insight into the mind of the animal.

**Bargain:** Used with any intelligent being.

**Carouse:** Used with any intelligent being.

**Charm:** Used with any intelligent being.

**Etiquette:** Used with any intelligent being.

**Folk Ken:** This is an understanding of human beings only, though it may provide insight into the motivations of human-like beings or magic characters who were once human.

**Guile:** Used with any intelligent being.

**Intrigue:** Used with any intelligent being.

**(Language):** All intelligent beings can learn to speak languages, and without a common tongue they must attempt to communicate through other means.

**Leadership:** Used with any intelligent being.

**Magic Lore:** This may be used like Folk Ken when attempting to understand the motivations and personality of magical beings.

**Teaching:** Used with any intelligent being.

- As long as the character concentrates, it recovers 1 Might Point for each level of the Magic aura over the course of about ten minutes, so that when concentrating in a level 5 Magic aura, a character with this Ability would recover 30 Might Points every hour.
- By concentrating within a Magic aura, the character may prevent Acclimation at twice the normal rate. For example, a character with 30 Might could prevent acclimation as if it had a Might Score of 15.

While concentrating, the character usually appears to be asleep. Magical beings with nonliving forms may appear completely inanimate to outsiders during this time. If disturbed, the character must roll on the Concentration table (**ArM5**, page 82), using this Ability instead of Concentration. Failure means that the effort is wasted for that period.

**Specialties:** recovering Might Points, preventing Acclimation, maintaining concentration (Supernatural)

## *Advancement*

For magic characters, advancement is the mystical process of becoming more magical. It is striving toward the truest embodiment of the concept that defines the character, enhancing and focusing the character's most essential nature. In this way the character can become more like what it already is: more powerful, more knowledgeable, more important, or more mysterious. It does this through a process called Transformation. Magic characters also need magic in order to survive, to feed the part of them that is sustained by magic. If they go too long without refreshing this magical thirst, some of their magical qualities are lost. This process of losing magic over time is called Acclimation.

Being fully part of the realm of Magic, such characters are not as concerned with mundane things. They are bound in a state of perfection, and cease to naturally grow or change over time. For this reason magic characters do not advance as other characters — they do not

![](_page_50_Picture_39.jpeg)

gain experience points each season or improve their knowledge and abilities through practice and discovery. Upon becoming a magical being, all non-magical learning ceases, and the character becomes only what it already is on a fundamental level: forever, eternal, and immortal, like a memory or an ideal.

This is not to say that a magic character cannot advance. It can, but it is much more difficult. Magic characters can accumulate and spend experience points just like normal human characters, save for one important limitation: the character's Might Score is always subtracted from its Advancement Total. For example, a character with Magic Might 10 that would gain 15 experience points must subtract 10 for his Might Score, yielding only 5 points to spend. For most magic characters, this is a significant enough penalty that the character will never improve its scores beyond their initial values at character creation, and it is not unusual for powerful beings with Might Scores of 20 or more to live for hundreds of years without significantly changing in the slightest.

There is a relatively simple way for the character to circumvent this limitation, however. If the character consumes a pawn of magic vis of any type, he may reduce the penalty to his Advancement Total by two. For example, if the character in the above example were to spend 5 pawns of vis, it could assign all 15 experience points in its Advancement Total. If the same character consumed 4 pawns, it would have 7 experience points to spend. (Note that this vis lessens the penalty, but does not increase the Advancement Total.)

Characters with the Gifted Virtue may learn Supernatural Abilities like other characters with The Gift, but they must also subtract the sum of their scores in all other Supernatural Abilities, in addition to their Might Score. They may spend vis to offset this penalty as usual, though they can use no more than a number of pawns equal to their Might Score in a single season. Gifted magic characters may also initiate new Virtues and Flaws through a Mystery Cult in the same way as magi (described in *The Mysteries, Revised Edition* and *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*).

## *Transformation*

Transformation is the term for bringing about permanent improvements to a magic character's form, making it more magical without changing what it essentially is. For this reason, these improvements cannot go against the character's essential nature — a magical dog that becomes more magical must still be a magical dog, even if it gains the power to fly, breathe fire, or change itself into a human shape. Any time a character experiences the

## *Magic Qualities and Initiation Scripts*

It is possible to teach other magical beings new Magic Qualities by writing a book about them, but this is an incredibly rare phenomenon, since few magic characters can read and write. Such a book might resemble an Initiation Script for a particularly esoteric Mystery Cult (see *The Mysteries, Revised Edition* pages 15-18), and at the troupe's discretion it may be adapted by a Mystagogue for the Initiation of an appropriate Virtue. Books on other mystic subjects — such as Magic Lore or a Mystery Cult's Organization Lore — that collect Initiation Scripts may also be treated as transformational study sources if they are particularly applicable to the Magic Quality in question, again with the troupe's approval.

process of transformation, the troupe should agree that the change does not fundamentally conflict with its true form, otherwise the transformation cannot happen that way.

The basic mechanic for transformation uses experience points. Magic characters can gain new Qualities and Inferiorities by devoting experience to their study. These can be experience points gained from practice, adventure, or a teacher who possesses the desired Quality. (Practicing a Quality that you already possess with the intention of improving upon it has a Study Total of 5.) You must still subtract the character's Might Score from the study total, as described above, and as usual the character can offset this penalty by consuming vis. The number of experience points necessary for each type of Quality is shown on the table below.

#### **Experience Points:** 0

Transform a Virtue into a Magic Quality of the same type (Major or Minor), a Flaw into a Magic Inferiority of the same type, a Magic Quality into a different Magic Quality of the same type, or a Magic Inferiority into a different Magic Inferiority of the same type.

![](_page_51_Picture_14.jpeg)

Gain a Minor Magic Quality and a Minor Magic Inferiority

**Experience Points:** 10 Gain a Minor Magic Quality

**Experience Points:** 15

Gain a Major Magic Quality and a Major Magic Inferiority

**Experience Points:** 20

Transform a Minor Magic Quality into a Major Magic Quality, a Minor Magic Inferiority into a Minor Magic Quality, or a Major Magic Inferiority into a Minor Magic Inferiority

**Experience Points:** 25

Gain a Major Magic Quality and a Minor Magic Inferiority

**Experience Points:** 30 Gain a Major Magic Quality

Magic characters may also consume vis as a transformational study source, and can spend the experience points to gain new Qualities and Inferiorities, without subtracting its Might Score from the Advancement Total. The character must use a number of pawns of vis of any type equal to its Might Score. Then, roll a stress die and add the bonus for the aura in which the character studies. The result is the number of experience points gained. If you roll a 0, you must roll one botch die for every 5 pawns of vis that the character consumed, and each botch gives the character a Minor Inferiority, or a Major Inferiority for every three botches.

## *Acclimation*

Magic characters are nurtured by the power of Magic, and they rely upon it to survive. Over time, those magic characters that do not maintain a connection to the realm of Magic slowly lose some of their magical power. This process is called **Acclimation**: the character becomes less magical as it becomes more conditioned to the mundane world and more distant from the Magic Realm.

Acclimation is handled as follows. At the end of every year, when other characters make Aging rolls, a magic character either loses a Magic Quality, or else reduces its Might Score by 1 — the player of the character may choose which of these takes place. This loss is permanent. If the character can-

![](_page_51_Picture_28.jpeg)

![](_page_52_Picture_0.jpeg)

not do either of these things, it ceases to be a magic character, losing the Virtue that made it a magic character and becoming a mundane being appropriate to its true form.

There are three ways to protect a magic character against this effect, and all magic characters should ensure that they meet at least one of these conditions every year. These are: living in a strong Magic aura, affecting or being affected by others with magic, and consuming a sufficient amount of magical vis.

Which method a magic character chooses to avoid Acclimation depends mostly upon its Might Score, but also upon its temperament. Magic characters with low Might generally rely upon the Magic aura where they live. Intelligent magic characters with low Might Scores often seek out a ward or master with which they can bond. More powerful intelligent characters might seek out people and things aligned to Magic that they can watch over or prey upon selectively throughout the year, or else retreat into the Magic Realm where they do not need to worry about Acclimation at all. Unintelligent characters of all sorts typically have a natural drive to seek out vis and consume it, ensuring both that they avoid Acclimation and grow more magical over time.

#### **Auras**

If a magic character lives in a Magic aura, or has a low Might Score and spends a lot of time there, it can avoid Acclimation. The strength of the aura required depends upon the character's Might (rounded up), as shown on the table below.

|                |                    | Minimum Aura Strength  |                  |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Might<br>Score | Always H<br>Within | alf Time F<br>Within V | requent<br>isits |
| 0              | 1                  | 5                      | 8                |
| 1–5            | 1                  | 6                      | 9                |
| 6–10           | 2                  | 7                      | 10               |
| 11–15          | 3                  | 8                      | -                |
| 16–20          | 4                  | 9                      | -                |
| 21–25          | 5                  | 10                     | -                |
| 26–30          | 6                  | -                      | -                |
| 31–35          | 7                  | -                      | -                |
| 36–40          | 8                  | -                      | -                |
| 41–45          | 9                  | -                      | -                |
| 46–50          | 10                 | -                      | -                |
| 51+            | -                  | -                      | -                |

To be considered "always within" an aura, the character must spend nearly all of its time there, though occasional forays into the outside world are allowed. More than about 40 days' absence, however, and the aura will not prevent Acclimation that year. Likewise, for "half time within" the character should at least reside within the aura, perhaps going there when other characters go to sleep, or else spending about two seasons each year within it. "Frequent visits" is about a quarter of the character's time, or one concentrated season every year.

As shown on the chart, a magic character with a Might Score of greater than 50 cannot avoid Acclimation by living in a Magic aura. The most powerful and reclusive magic characters typically live in the Twilight Void, that part of the Magic Realm in which they never gain Acclimation, and only occasionally manifest in the mundane world at all. For the purposes of a character that visits but does not remain there all year, treat the Magic Realm as an aura of 10 and halve the character's Might Score. For example, a character with Might 20 could avoid Acclimation by spending one season each year in the Magic Realm.

Magic characters can also protect

#### **Effects**

link between the two that sustains the magic character for as long as it lasts. Perhaps the most common example of this is the bond between magus and familiar, where the familiar becomes magically bound to the magus through magical cords that help it resist Acclimation — this explains why many intelligent magic creatures are willing to submit to the bond, since it means they will never suffer Acclimation again. Another example is when a magical being acts as a

being the targets of powerful Magic effects that do not originate from a creature with Might, or by using their own powers to periodically affect an individual that is aligned with the Magic realm, but who does not have Magic Might. This creates a supernatural

warder for a non-magical character, using its powers to protect and advise its charge throughout the year — by doing so, it ensures its own survival. The chart below shows the number of seasons each year that the character must af-

fect its counterpart with its powers (based on its Might Score), or must be affected by its counterpart's magic (based on the level of the effect), in order to avoid Acclimation. The first column shows how many seasons of

## *Vis Consumption*

Whenever a magic character avoids Acclimation by consuming vis, roll a stress die and consult the following chart. The number of botch dice is equal to the number of pawns of vis consumed.

| Roll R | esult                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| 0      | Possible botch, otherwise no effect |
| 2–4    | No effect                           |
| 5–6    | Side effect (negative)              |
| 7–8    | Side effect (positive)              |
| 9      | Special or story event              |
| 10+    | Transformation                      |

**Botch:** The character gains a Minor Inferiority for every botch, or a Major Inferiority for every three botches, though other negative effects appropriate to the situation are also possible, such as a personal injury, loss of Fatigue, or a ruined project.

**Side Effect:** The character (or something very close to it) is affected by a magical side effect, one that is either positive or negative and is somehow appropriate to the circumstances and the type of vis consumed. For example, the character might spontaneously generate a magical effect, temporarily gain or lose Might Points, or perhaps increase or decrease an appropriate Essential Trait (see Essential Traits, below).

**Special or Story Event:** This is usually something that involves the whole troupe, or that happens without the character's knowledge. It could also be an effect that adds to the story or that is not covered elsewhere. For example, perhaps the character becomes pregnant, experiences a vision of the past or future, or gains the attention of a more-powerful magical being.

**Transformation:** The character is changed for the better by the process of magical transformation, and gains a number of experience points equal to the result of the roll, which may be applied to a new Quality (see Transformation, above) or to any appropriate Abilities. The character does not have to subtract its Might Score from this Advancement Total unless the character is Gifted and wishes to learn a new Supernatural Ability.

second shows seasons of effects that are applied regularly (approximately once a day), and the last shows seasons of effects applied only occasionally (approximately once a week). For example, a magic character with Might 15 would need to constantly affect a mundane character for three seasons every year, and a level 30 effect cast by a character without a Might Score will protect a magic character for two out of every four seasons.

At the end of each year, the storyguide should determine whether the magic character affected its partner or was affected by its partner to a sufficient degree to prevent Acclimation. (Magic characters that are somehow associated with a covenant should be able to easily meet this requirement.)

#### **Vis**

Magic characters can consume vis to ensure that they do not suffer Acclimation. A magic character is safe any year in which it consumes (Magic Might Score / 2) pawns of magic vis, of any type. For example, a character with Magic Might 15 would need to find 8 pawns of vis every year. This is how many magic creatures survive in the wild, by hunting down vis and feeding on it. With preparation, magic characters with access to a lot of vis can endure being distant from Magic for a very long time.

Whenever a magic character avoids Acclimation by consuming vis, the player must make a roll on the Vis Consumption chart. This determines how exposure to the vis affects the character over time, since subsisting on vis can have interesting side effects and always carries some degree of supernatural risk.

## *Essential Traits*

Part of the power of the Magic realm is devoted to the pursuit of unchanging ideals, making things more of what they are at the most fundamental level, and because of this, characters with a Magic Might Score do not easily develop new Personality Traits, or increase or decrease their existing Personality Traits. Their Personality Traits become **Essential**, meaning that they are an unchanging part of the character's nature. However, these Essential Traits also define how magic characters behave, and so they become a kind of magical protection — magical effects that would force a character to act against its Essential Traits always mysteriously fail.

Many Essential Traits describe a specialty of one of the character's Characteristics (this is called a Character Trait to distinguish it from a Personality Trait, though it can be written under Personality Traits on the character sheet). For example, a character might be Sure-footed (Dexterity) +2, or he might be especially Shy (Presence) +3. These Essential Traits modify the appropriate Characteristic in circumstances applicable to the specialty like so: if the Characteristic is positive and the Trait is beneficial, use the greater of the two; if the Characteristic is negative and the Trait is detrimental, use the lesser of the two; otherwise, add the Trait to the Characteristic. (This is the same method used to determine a shapechanger's characteristics in *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*.)

Characters typically develop Essential Traits upon returning from the Magic Realm, in much the same way that magi gain Twilight Scars (and Twilight Scars are basically Essential Traits for magi). They can also be gained from Virtues and Flaws (see Essential Virtue or Essential Flaw, above), and all Personality Flaws come with a corresponding Essential Trait as well. To make Essential Traits easier to distinguish from Personality Traits, you should always mark them with an asterisk on the character sheet.

## *Chapter Five*

# *Magic Animals*

Magic animals cover a very wide range of creatures, from mice that occasionally cough fire to the mighty dragons. Many of them are not intelligent, but even so they are often sought out by magi, both as sources of vis and as potential familiars. Some magic animals seek magi out in turn, aiming to steal their vis sources or prey on more-mundane resources. This chapter details a variety of such creatures, suited to a wide range of saga roles.

## *Beasts of Virtue*

Beasts of Virtue are highly sought after by Hermetic magi, because they are well suited to being familiars. However, they are rare: in any given habitat of reasonable size (a forest, a lake, or so forth) there may be only one Beast of Virtue. Further, they aren't naturally distinguished from their mundane fellows without magic they are more-perfect creatures of their species, but this isn't always apparent to the eye. A Beast of Virtue epitomizes all the traits of its species, often to a supernatural degree. The mythic qualities assigned to animals in *Physiologus* and the Bestiaries are actually possessed by Beasts of Virtue rather than their mundane counterparts, and they only have powers that relate to the perfection of their mythic properties. Other magical beasts exist with different powers, but these are Transformed Beasts (see below), not Beasts of Virtue.

No Hermetic attempt to create a Beast of Virtue has succeeded; such attempts result in a Transformed Beast, if the creature manages to survive the experimentation process and the Warping. Many magi liken the Beasts of Virtue to a Gifted human, and thus in their arrogance make themselves the epitome of the human species.

The corpse of a Beast of Virtue typically contains 1 pawn of vis for each 5 points (or fraction) of Might it possessed; and often the part of the body that contains this vis may be made into an Object of Virtue by a hedge magician (see Chapter 8: Magic Things).

## *Designing Beasts of Virtue*

Beasts of Virtue should be designed according to the rules in Chapter 4: Magical Characters. The following sections provide guidance on how to use those rules specifically to create a Beast of Virtue. The key features that make a magical animal into a Beast of Virtue are the Inherited Virtues and Flaws listed below, and the absence of Flaws that represent physical defects.

**Inherited Virtues**: Magic Animal; Essential Virtue (Major or Minor)

**Inherited Flaws**: Any Personality Flaw (Major or Minor)

#### **Concept**

You have 7 points to spend on Characteristics, just as other characters. The creatures in the Book of Mundane Beasts appendix or those generated with the rules in *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* (pages 38–43) all have 7 points spent on the four physical Characteristics only, and have predetermined scores for the four mental Characteristics based on the type of animal. You may choose to accept the mental Characteristics as given (suitable for storyguide characters), or determine mental Characteristics in the usual fashion. Beasts of Virtue rarely have Intelligence rather than Cunning; however, those played as characters are often exceptional in this regard (because it's no fun playing an unintelligent creature; see Chapter 4: Characters, Cunning Characters).

All Beasts of Virtue possess the Special Virtue, Magic Animal. Every Beast of Virtue must also take an Essential Virtue (as either a Minor or Major Magical Quality) to represent those areas in which it excels. This Essential Virtue always typifies the species to which the character belongs — a Viper of Virtue might have Deception as an Essential Virtue, but could not take Friendly or Keen Hearing.

Your storyguide will also indicate whether there are any Virtues and Flaws that are intrinsic to the species to which you belong, and you must buy these with your normal allotment of Virtues and Flaws. You may then spend any unused Flaw points on Virtues, and take more Flaws to purchase new Virtues up to your limit for the character type (3 points of flaws for a grog character, 10 points otherwise). You cannot take any Flaw that makes your character a worse example of its base creature; nor any Virtue that hinders it from being the epitome of its species. Beasts of Virtue are therefore never Lame or Blind. Most Beasts of Virtue have the Magical Creature Social Status Flaw.

Common Virtues and Flaws include:

Greater Immunity, Ways of the (Land); Ferocity\*\*, Intuition, Large\*\*\*, Lesser Immunity, Magic Sensitivity, Premonitions, Puissant Ability, Reserves of Strength, Second Sight, Strong-Willed, Tireless\*, Tough, Unaffected by The Gift\*, Wilderness Sense; Essential Flaw (Major)\*, Greater Malediction, Wanderlust\*; Essential Flaw (Minor)\*, Lesser Malediction, Magical Air; any Personality Flaw; Heroic Virtues and Flaws from *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, pages 103–109.

- \* See Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Virtues and Flaws
- \*\* The Ferocity Virtue is described in *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*, page 40, or the Book of Mundane Beasts appendix.
- \*\*\*A creature with the Large Virtue has 1 less point of Quickness and 2 more points of Strength than its base statistics.

#### **Season and Abilities**

A Beast of Virtue typically has the speed of growth of a mundane animal, so a Spring character has usually reached prime condition for a member of its species, at about five years old. As Summer characters, Beasts of Virtue have exceeded the natural lifespan of creatures of their species. Very few Beasts of Virtue are Autumn or Winter characters. You must spend some of your allotted experience points on the Abilities of a creature of your species, at the scores they normally possess. You may spend the rest of your Ability points as you see fit, but cannot typically spend points on human languages or human social Abilities unless you have had substantial contact with humans.

#### **Might and Qualities**

Once you've decided the role of the Beast of Virtue in your saga, determine its Might and spend these points on Magical Qualities, taking Magical Inferiorities if you want more points to spend.

Beasts of Virtue often have Magical Qualities that grant magical powers (most commonly a Lesser, Personal, or Greater Power rather than a Focus or Ritual Power), but cannot take powers that do not relate to their role as species epitomes. Thus a Dog of Virtue cannot have the Power to breathe fire, but it can have a supernaturally enhanced capacity for tracking. Inspiration for magical powers possessed by Beasts of Virtue can be obtained from the descriptions in medieval bestiaries.

#### **Finishing Touches**

Animals typically have natural weapons in the shape of teeth, claws, or horns; and may have a Protection score provided by their thick hide, fur, or scales. Additionally, some animals have bonuses to certain types of rolls — goats are good at climbing, cats are good at jumping, and so forth. In *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* (pages 40–43), these are called Qualities and are natural properties of the animal rather than the Magical Qualities discussed in Chapter 4. You should consult with your storyguide for details of all these final touches.

Remember to subtract the Size of a Beast of Virtue from the initial Might score to get the final Might score. This doesn't affect the points available to spend on Magical Qualities.

The Black Boar guards a swampy portion of a larger wood that is filled with gnarled trees. The dense canopy of the wood gives it a foreboding feeling, but it is filled with wildlife. This section of the wood is a haven for herbivores because the Black Boar guards it jealously. He attacks all large predators and men who enter the area, regardless of their intentions toward the inhabitants. The Black Boar is a solitary creature, but quickly lends his protection to any inhabitants of his area that come under attack.

The Boar's tusks may be Enriched by soaking them in the blood of the Boar for one month and then using the tusks to strike the killing blow on a predator that hunted the area where the Boar lived. If this is done, any character carrying the tusks in battle is granted the Berserk Virtue.

**Powers:**

*Nose of the Bloodhound*, 1 point, Init –2, Corpus or Animal

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Once the Black Dog picks up the scent of a creature, he may track it to the ends of the earth. If the Black Dog frequents the same location as the quarry or examines one of its personal effects and makes a Perception roll against an Ease Factor of 6, the Black Dog picks up the creature's scent. As long as the Black Dog is tracking the quarry, he always knows the direction of the shortest path to the quarry.

InCo(An) 25 (Base 3, +4 Arc, +1 Conc, +1 special effect: scent serves as Arcane Connection): Greater Power x2 (25 levels,

–2 Might cost, +65 xp in Penetration) *Dominate Canine*, 1 point, Init –3, Animal

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

Any canine that hears the voice of the Black Dog is strongly inclined to obey his orders. This is similar to the spell *Aura of Rightful Authority*.

ReAn 35 (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

*Leader of the Pack*, 2 points, Init –3, Animal R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

When the Black Dog is present in any group of canines, they fight as a trained group and all of their attack rolls are at +2. ReAn 40 (Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group): Greater Power (40 levels, –2 Might cost)

*Shadow Form*, 1 point, Init –3, Animal R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind

When the Black Dog enters a shadow that is big enough to cover his Size +1, he may take the form of shadow. While in shadow form, the Black Dog adds +4 to all Stealth rolls and is unaffected by physical attacks.

## *Beasts of Virtue Story Seeds*

#### **A Noble's Folly**

The son of a local noble becomes obsessed with the stories of a monstrous black boar that cannot be killed. The heir is killed hunting the Black Boar of the Bog and the noble swears revenge on it. The noble's advisor comes to beg the characters for their assistance in defeating the boar. The magi realize that the advisor is withholding something from them. In truth, the advisor thought the heir unfit to rule and persuaded him to hunt the beast, knowing that it would likely kill him. Now the advisor fears the same fate will befall his lord, or, worse, that his role in the heir's death will be uncovered.

#### **Hunt for the Black Dog**

A local noble beats his hounds when the hunt is unsuccessful. After a Black Dog of the Moor witnesses this, he attacks the noble and frees the hounds. While the noble hunts the Black Dog, he interferes with the covenant's vis collection, harasses the local faeries, and generally makes a nuisance of himself. Finally, the noble demands the assistance of the covenant in hunting the magical beast. A problem arises when the characters discover that a powerful maga has allied with the Black Dog, who uses his tracking powers to great effectiveness in Marching her enemies. The maga encourages the Black Dog to kill the noble, whose lands are far from her covenant. The characters are forced to mediate the dispute.

### **The Imprisoned Caladrius**

Both kings and magi greatly prize the caladrius for its healing powers. Such a powerful character has captured a caladrius and plans to keep it until his next aging crisis. The kind-hearted bird wants only to be set free so it can use its healing power to help others. Perhaps it finds a way to ask the characters for help, or maybe it escapes on its own and the characters are accused of stealing it.

#### **The Cockerel's Crow**

Invisible demons (in spirit form) have been menacing a village for years, but a Cockerel of Virtue has kept them away. Recently, the magic cockerel lost a fight to a mundane bird and has stopped crowing, so the demons are now free to terrorize the villagers. The characters can either confront the spirits themselves, or find some way to restore the bird's confidence.

#### **The Stallion Guide**

The characters need to locate someone or something in the Camargue. The Great Stallion of the Camargue knows the area better than any other living creature. How do they approach him for assistance? The Stallion and his herd flee from any humans. Once the characters are able to communicate with the Stallion, what can they offer him in exchange for his information?

The Black Dog of the Moor dominates all canines in his area and considers it his duty to protect dogs, wolves, and jackals, where present. He fights any canine in the area that challenges his authority, but only kills when the food supply is insufficient to support the local canine population. The Black Dog of the Moor is generally indifferent to the activities of humans, but in some areas, where wolves or jackals are hunted, he takes a more active role and discourages the hunts by harassing or killing the hunters.

The Black Dog of the Moor is one example of a class of creature called Black Dogs. The Black Dogs go by many different names, as they are known throughout northern Europe — Ireland (Coinn Iotair), Wales (Cwn Annwn), England (Gytrash), Isle of Manx (Mauthe Dhoog), France (Rongeur D'os), and Brittany (Youdic Dogs). The Black Dogs are solitary and have well-delineated habitats. They often prowl a moor, swamp, or abandoned castle.

Some people believe these hounds to be agents of the Infernal, but this is largely based on fear of the unknown and the hounds' habit of prowling their territory at night. A Black Dog will assert its dominance over the territory by closely following or chasing nighttime travelers. A Black Dog never attacks unless its

The hide of a Black Dog may be Enriched by tanning it in total darkness. It must then be buried under a new moon and left undisturbed for one month. The resulting hide may be fashioned into a cowl that grants the wearer the Puissant Stealth Virtue.

#### **Caladrius**

*If anyone is ill, the caladrius will tell whether the patient will live or die.*

— Pierre de Beauvais

**Magic Might:** 14 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Cun –1, Per +2, Pre +1, Com –2, Str –4, Sta +3, Dex +1, Qik +2

**Size:** –2 **Season:** Spring

**Virtues and Flaws:** Magic Animal; Magical Friend; Essential Virtue (magnificent appearance), Unaffected by the Gift, Lesser Immunity (to non-lethal diseases); Noncombatant, Compassionate (minor)

**Magic Qualities and Inferiorities:** Ritual Power (x2); Improved Abilities, Improved Might (x2), Ignem Resistance, Improved Powers, Personal Power; Minor Flaw: Restricted Power, Susceptible to Deprivation

**Personality Traits:** Ibis\* +3, Magnificent Appearance\* (Presence) +3

**Combat:**

*Dodge:* Init +2, Attack n/a, Defense +5, Damage n/a

**Soak:** +3

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties**: –1 (1–3), –3 (4–6), –5 (7– 9), Incapacitated (10–12), Dead (13+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 3 (flying), Awareness 4 (food), Brawl 2 (dodging), Ignem Resistance (solar heat) 4, Survival 3 (wetlands)

**Powers:**

*Healing Gaze*, 4 points, Init –14, Corpus R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind

> By gazing into a person's eyes, the caladrius can draw out any non-fatal disease from a sick person into itself. This removes any disease of up to Incapacitating strength, or resolves a critical or lesser aging crisis. The caladrius must immediately fly up toward the sun or else the disease returns to the patient (this is a Restricted Power).

CrCo 40 (Base 30, +1 Eye, +1 affect either disease or aging): Ritual Power x2 *Magic*

(40 levels, –2 Might cost), Improved Powers (–2 Might cost)

*Perceive the Afflictions of Mortal Flesh*, 0 points, Init +1, Corpus

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Sight

By sight, the caladrius can identify any diseases a person has and how serious they are.

InCo 25 (Base 5, +4 Sight): Personal Power (25 levels), Improved Powers (–3 Might cost)

**Vis:** 3 Corpus (1 in each eye, 1 in the wings) **Appearance:** The caladrius is a magnificent, all-white bird somewhat resembling a heron (but with shorter legs and beak). It has a long, gracefully curving neck and a short, slightly downward-curving beak.

A caladrius is a mystical bird much sought by royal households. It can determine whether a sick person will live or die. If the patient is to die, the caladrius sadly turns away from him, but if he is to live, it gazes deeply into his eyes, drawing the sickness into itself. It then flies away toward the sun, going so high that the sun's rays burn away the disease (but they do not harm the caladrius itself).

A caladrius will not absorb a terminal illness (its Lesser Immunity would not protect it), but it will gladly heal any lesser ailment. It can heal either spontaneous diseases, which result from aging crises (see **ArM5**, page 168) or diseases due to an external cause (**ArM5**, page 180). As long as the crisis is not terminal or the disease does not cause a Lethal Wound, a caladrius can cure it. It can only heal wounds caused by disease, not those resulting from poison, combat, or other causes. It cannot remove Decrepitude.

The eyes of a caladrius are Enriched by grinding them to a paste, which is then used to fill a hollow wing bone taken from the same bird. This must be soaked in the urine of a virgin girl for a season, after which time it grants the wielder the Puissant Medicine Virtue.

#### **Cockerel of Virtue**

**Magic Might:** 9 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Cun –2, Per +2, Pre +2, Com 0, Str –6, Sta 0, Dex +2, Qik +4

**Size:** –3 **Season:** Spring

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Magic Animal; Magical Champion; Essential Virtue (proud, minor), Ferocity (battles for dominance); Compulsion (fight for dominance), Overconfident (minor), Restricted Power (nocturnal spirits only)

**Magic Qualities and Inferiorities:** Greater Power; Improved Might, Improved Powers, Minor Virtue: Sense Holiness and Unholiness; Susceptible to Deprivation

**Personality Traits:** Cockerel\* +3, Proud +3 **Reputations:** Proud (local) 3

**Combat:**

*Spurs:* Init +3, Attack +8, Defense +10, Damage –5

*Beak:* Init +4, Attack +8, Defense +8, Damage –5

**Soak:** 0

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties**: –1 (1–3), –3 (3–4), –5 (5–6), Incapacitated (7–8), Dead (9+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 1 (balancing), Awareness 3 (invisible spirits), Brawl 3 (spurs), Music 3 (crowing), Penetration 4 (Mentem effects), Sense Holiness and Unholiness 3 (invisible spirits)

**Powers:**

*Scourge the Spirits of the Night*, 0 points, Init +4, Mentem

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Sound

When the Cockerel of Virtue crows, any nocturnal spirits who hear the sound (and whose Magic Resistance fails to protect them) are stricken with panic and flee the area, remaining away until the next sunrise or sunset. This power is effective against spirits of any Realm, as long as they are only active at night (including most ghosts and some demons and dark fae, at the storyguide's discretion).

CrMe 20 (Base 4, +2 Sun, +3 Sound): Greater Power (20 levels, +1 Initiative, –2 Might cost, 15 xp Penetration)

**Vis:** 2 Vim in comb

The Cockerel of Virtue benefits farmers through its crowing, which drives away evil spirits. A mundane cockerel normally crows to herald the coming of dawn, so the Cockerel of Virtue's cry terrifies spirits of darkness through the Law of Sympathy. A variant effect for the Cockerel's crow may be found on page 29 of *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*.

Cocks fight one another for dominance. The winner is the proudest of all creatures and struts regally around the barnyard, but the loser becomes dejected (temporarily gaining the Personality Flaw, Depressed) and does not crow.

The comb of a Cockerel of Virtue can be Enriched by stretching the skin over an amber bead which must then rest on consecrated ground for a period not less than 12 Sundays. When worn around the neck, the wearer gains Second Sight with an Ability of 3.

The Camargue is a large, flat, and marshy delta region of the Rhône River. Within the marsh live the magical, wild horses of the Camargue. They are a herd that can run faster and leap higher than any mundane horse.

They are nearly impossible to capture because they are led by the Great Stallion of the Camargue. The Stallion has an extensive knowledge of the Camargue and a magical ability to sense any potential trap. The Stallion leads the herd away from trouble whenever possible. The Great Stallion of the Camargue cannot be broken without magic, but may grant a particularly brave or noble warrior the honor of riding it for a short time.

The Stallion leads a herd of Horses of Virtue. The horses are largely similar to the Great Stallion, except they are Magic Might 10 and do not possess the Stallion's ability to *Sense the Feet that Tread the Earth*, the Ways of the Marsh Virtue, or the Improved Abilities Quality, which reduces their (Area) Lore (Camargue) to only 3.

The Stallion's hooves may be Enriched by carving them into various accoutrements for a bit, bridle, and saddle to outfit a single horse. The leather used to construct the tack must be of the finest quality and anointed with oil infused with one dozen leaves of coltsfoot harvested under a full moon. The rider who uses the resulting tack is granted the Puissant Ride Virtue.

**Powers:**

*Terrifying Roar*, 3 points, Init +2, Animal or Mentem

R: Per, D: Diameter, T: Sound

A Lion of Virtue can unleash a roar causing all who hear it to freeze in terror. This power affects both humans and animals.

ReAn(Me) 30 (Base 5, +1 Diameter, +3 Sound, +1 Mentem requisite): Greater Power (30 levels, +2 Initiative, 10 xp Penetration)

*Trackless Step*, 1 point, Init 0, Terram R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

ReAn 10 (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 continuous effect): Personal Power (10 levels, –1 Might cost, 10 xp Penetration)

**Vis:** 6 Rego in mane

Pentele is literally the King of Beasts. All other animals yield to his majesty — except the cockerel, which struts so proudly that even Pentele is cowed. Pentele rules an animal kingdom in some remote part of Mythic Europe (deep in the wilderness, or perhaps in a strong Magic aura or regio). Just as there are many nations and many rulers in the lands of men, so there are many different Lions of Virtue, each ruling over a different animal kingdom. Like any ruler, Pentele is attended by nobles, courtiers, guards, and lackeys — a retinue of Beasts of Virtue of many different species.

If, during his travels, a Lion of Virtue catches scent of humans, it covers its tracks by sweeping the earth behind itself with its tail. Ever watchful for hunters and enemies, it sleeps with its eyes open so as not to be taken unaware.

Though mighty and very wild, a Lion of Virtue is merciful by nature. Pierre be Beauvais writes that the lion spares small, defenseless animals; it refrains from attacking women, children, and unarmed men. A person who throws herself on the ground in submission to

![](_page_59_Picture_51.jpeg)

a Lion of Virtue will receive mercy.

A Lion of Virtue is afraid of the sound of turning wheels and, like most beasts, it has a healthy respect for fire. It is a natural enemy of dragons.

To Enrich a Lion of Virtue's mane, each individual hair must be plucked and spun into thread, then woven with gold thread into a fabric collar worn by its maker. Once per day, the wearer can make eye contact with an animal and duplicate the effects of *Mastering the Unruly Beast* (**ArM5**, page 120) as a Greater Power that has a Penetration Total of 5. However, the collar's wearer cannot show fear when commanding an animal; if the animal is threatening him he must make a Brave roll (with an Ease Factor determined by the fierceness of the animal in question). If he gets scared while controlling an animal, the power automatically fails.

Alternatively, the mane can be Enriched by curing the skin with potash and anointing it with oil made from sage plants every three days at noon. When made into a belt, it grants a Lesser Immunity to Fear.

#### **Panther of Virtue**

*Its is said that all four-footed beasts are wonderfully delighted and enticed by the smell of panthers; but [the panthers'] hideous looks and crabbed countenance which they betray so soon as they show their heads, scares them as much again: and therefore their manner is, to hide their heads, and when they have trained other beasts within their reach by their sweet savor, they fly upon them and worry them.*

*Pleasing Breath*, 2 points, Init +1, Animal or Mentem

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Scent

The breath of the panther has an irresistible, savory smell as of all the spices in the world. Any human or beast who smells it becomes entranced unless it succeeds on a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Entranced victims follow the scent to where the panther lies in ambush. The panther's breath travels on the wind and is effective at up to 100 paces in ideal conditions. Dragons are immune to its effects.

ReAn 35 (Base 15, +1 Conc, +2 Scent, +1 Mentem requisite): Greater Power (35 levels, –2 Might cost, 5 xp Concentration)

**Vis:** 3 Rego in tongue

**Appearance:** The Panther of Virtue is about the size of a large dog. Its fur is white and covered with small spots of many colors. The face of a Panther of Virtue is hideous to behold, with bulging eyes and a twisted, evil expression. It has a pronounced muzzle and a gaping maw filled with sharp teeth.

The Panther of Virtue is a dangerous predator whose fragrant breath lures animals to their doom. The animals walk, mesmerized, toward where the panther lies in hiding. The spell is broken when they see its hideous face, but by then it is too late.

The Panther of Virtue preys mainly on weak animals — it is not a brave beast and flees if it encounters serious resistance. When it attacks from hiding, it automatically wins Initiative in the first round of combat, and gains a +3 to its attack total for the first round only.

Pliny the Elder writes that panthers were brought from Africa to Italy for use in the Roman circus. Some might have escaped to

![](_page_60_Picture_35.jpeg)

survive in Mythic Europe, either in the remote wilderness or in regiones.

The tongue of a Panther of Virtue can grant the Entrancement Ability at a score of 3. It must first be Enriched by coating it with a thin layer of silver every week for a season, and then be inscribed with the words SAPHAT ELONAI METHIAX written in blue enamel. The tongue must be placed in the character's mouth to work (a Necessary Condition).

#### **Raven of Virtue**

*The ravens of all other birds, seem to have a knowledge of their own significations in presages and fore-tokens: for when the mercenary hired soldiers of Media were all massacred under a pretense of entertainment and hospitality, the ravens flew all away out of Peloponnesus and the region of Attica. The worst token of ill luck that they give, is when in their crying they seem to swallow in their voice as though they were choked.*

*Realms of Power*

The Raven of Virtue is a bird of ill omen. It can foresee many calamities and intentionally appears to humans as an enigmatic warning. It does this not to be helpful, but because it enjoys causing anxiety and consternation.

Ravens eat carrion as well as insects and small animals. When they come upon a corpse, they eat the eyes first. They do not feed their young until the fledglings develop black plumage. Before that time, the raven chicks must subsist on dew, but after their feathers grow their parents recognize them as their own and are careful and attentive.

The vis in a Raven of Virtue is Enriched by turning the whole corpse inside out, wrapping the bloody flesh in the leaves of plant called eyebright, then suspending it in the top branches of an ash tree for a season. The detached claws then grant the wearer the Keen Vision Virtue. If buried under the roots of a willow instead, the raven's skull grants the Intuition Virtue when crafted into a ring.

![](_page_61_Picture_40.jpeg)

Ignem

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The Salamander of Virtue can instantly extinguish any fire it touches, even the hottest furnace. If the fire is very large, only a three-pace radius around the Salamander is extinguished. Even if it does not use this power, the Salamander of Virtue is completely unharmed by heat and flames.

PeIg 15 (Base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Part, +2 Size): Greater Power (15 levels, +5 Initiative, –2 Might cost)

*Sense of the Bright Flame*, 0 points, Init n/a, Ignem R: Per, D: Sun, T: Hearing

The Salamander of Virtue can locate fires as if by sense of hearing. This power is continuously active.

InIg 15 (Base 2, +2 Sun, +3 Hearing, +1 continuous effect): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost)

*Poisoning the Well*, 1 point, Init +9, Aquam R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind

The Salamander of Virtue can poison water (or other liquid) by touch. The amount affected is ten times the base Individual target. The material remains poisonous for Moon Duration; if ingested, it inflicts an Incapacitating wound to any who fail a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 12. Since the poison is magical, Magic Resistance can protect against its effects. The Salamander of Virtue automatically invokes this power when it dies.

MuAq 45 (Base 10, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +1 Size): Greater Power (45 levels, –3 Might cost)

*Poisoning the Fruit of the Vine*, 4 points, Init +9, Herbam

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind

Similarly, by touching a fruit tree or edible plant, the Salamander of Virtue can make that plant poisonous to eat. The effects of the poison are identical to those from the Poisoning the Well power, above.

MuHe 50 (Base 20 (new guideline), +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Size): Greater Power (50 levels), Improved Powers (1 mastery point, –1 Might cost)

*Poisonous Skin*, 0 points, Init n/a, Aquam

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Finally, the Salamander of Virtue's skin is continuously coated with a contact poison that causes an Incapacitating Wound to any who touch it and fail a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 12. Magic Resistance protects against this effect normally. CrAq 40 (Base 20, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1

continuous effect): Greater Power (40 levels, –2 Might cost), Improved Powers (2 mastery points, –2 Might cost)

**Vis:** 5 pawns of dedicated Vis in the Art combination of Perdo Ignem (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Dedicated Vis)

**Appearance:** The salamander is a tiny lizard only two or three inches long. Its smooth, moist skin is covered with dark spots.

The word "salamander" comes from Greek. Magi use it as a kind of blanket term for various beings associated with the Form of Ignem. The term "Salamander of Virtue" specifically refers to a small lizard with remarkable powers over fire.

A Salamander of Virtue is very cold by nature and seeks out any source of heat: fires, or even warm-blooded creatures. When it finds a fire, a Salamander of Virtue eagerly crawls into it and extinguishes it.

The body of a Salamander of Virtue, if dried by smoking it over embers of alder wood, is Enriched into a Thing of Virtue. When touched to the hands, heart, and forehead (a Necessary Condition), it grants Immunity to Fire for as long as its possessor touches it.

#### **Stag of Virtue**

*...[W]hen the stag knows where the serpent is, he goes and fills his mouth with water and spits it down where the serpent is and draws him out ... and stamps him underfoot and thus kills him.*

#### *Magic*

## *Beasts of Virtue Story Seeds (con't)*

#### **Under Pentele's Protection**

The magi follow stories of a wondrous garden to a magical place inhabited by many Beasts of Virtue. However, all the animals there are under the protection of Pentele. If a means of communication can be found, Pentele may be willing to let the characters explore his realm and even hunt there, provided they perform some favor (such as driving away a small dragon that lives nearby).

#### **The Panther's Lure**

The covenant or its neighbors are suffering mysterious disappearances of animals. Stealing livestock is a serious crime in most parts of Mythic Europe; in many places it is punishable by death. Suspicions may fall on the magi, but a Panther of Virtue is actually to blame. Incautious characters who investigate may themselves fall victim to the Panther's lure.

#### **A Bad Omen**

A Raven of Virtue can be a novel, if somewhat heavy-handed, way to launch a story where something bad happens at the covenant. The *Aegis of the Hearth* keeps it out, so it must deliver its omen to grogs or covenfolk whose daily business takes them outside the covenant walls.

#### **Cold-Blooded Intruder**

A Salamander of Virtue finds its way into the covenant — its Might is high enough that it can go right through a weak *Aegis of the Hearth*. In its never-ending search for warmth it extinguishes cooking fires, puts out the blacksmith's forge, and eventually finds its way into the magi's laboratories. The creature is so small, it can easily crawl through cracks under doors or hide itself among the rushes on the floors. Grogs and covenfolk are probably terrified of the Salamander of Virtue because of its poison, though it is quite easy to kill by mundane means (if it can be found). An ambitious magus might want the Salamander of Virtue as a familiar, but the creature cares little for humans and is not easy to befriend.

#### **A Magical Quarry**

The characters need the healing powers in the antler of a Stag of Virtue to heal a sick friend. They can either hunt the stag or try to find one of its buried antlers. In many parts of Mythic Europe, hunting large game is a privilege reserved for the nobility. The characters may be accused of poaching, or they may find that the local noble is hunting the Stag of Virtue for himself. Because the Stag has the Ways of the Forest Virtue and an impressive Athletics score, it can be a difficult quarry.

#### **The White Warder**

Unknown to the magi, their grogs are hunting the forest of the White Stag of the Wood. Not only does this risk problems with the local noble, who hangs poachers, but the White Stag is upset by it. The Stag attacks any grog entering the wood. If magi begin to accompany the grogs, the Stag captures or devours as many of the covenant's vis sources as he can locate. The magi must gain the trust of the Stag and mediate a truce, or destroy him. If the characters kill the White Stag, the deer population is quickly depleted and a pack of Infernal wolves takes control of the forest.

#### **What the Owl Saw**

The Wise Owl of the Forest witnesses the characters doing something that they wish to keep quiet. A Quaesitor discovers the minor transgression and brings it up at the next Tribunal. The characters are left wondering how the Quaesitor uncovered their misdeeds, until they encounter a magical owl on their return trip who wants to talk for hours. If the characters exact revenge on the Owl, they lose a potentially valuable source of information about powerful magical creatures, vis sources, and hidden regiones in the forest.

*Delay the Serpent's Venom*, 0 points, Init n/a, Aquam

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The Stag of Virtue is magically warded against poison. Any poison introduced into the Stag's body takes no effect until the next sunrise or sunset (whichever comes first). This power activates whenever such a poison is introduced, and thus has an Intellego requisite.

Re(In)Aq 20 (Base 5, +2 Sun, +1 Intellego requisite): Personal Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost), Improved Powers (1 mastery point, –1 Might cost)

*Alleviate the Serpent's Bite*, 1 point, Init +1, Aquam

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

A Stag of Virtue can permanently neutralize any poison already inside its body. This is a Restricted Power, which the Stag must drink water to activate.

PeAq 15 (Base 15): Personal Power (15 levels, +1 Initiative, –1 Might cost)

**Vis:** 3 Creo in right antler. This is spell-like (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Spell-Like Vis) with an effect similar to *Restoration of the Defiled Body* (**ArM5,** page 129).

A Stag of Virtue is a great enemy of serpents and kills them whenever it can. It does this by filling its mouth with water and spitting it down the serpent's hole; when the serpent emerges to escape drowning, the Stag of Virtue tramples it to death.

A Stag of Virtue enjoys vigorous health and can live a very long time (in fact, like other Beasts of Virtue, it can live forever). To keep itself youthful and healthy, this stag swallows a live, venomous serpent. Then it drinks a large quantity of water to neutralize the venom. After this process, its antlers fall off and its vigor is restored. Hermetic experts concur that the Stag of Virtue actually consumes Magical serpents for this process and that it becomes weak and looks aged when it cannot find snakes to eat (such as during the winter). The Stag of Virtue lives only in places where Magical snakes can be found.

The right antler of a Stag of Virtue has healing powers and is greatly sought by hedge wizards and magi alike. The stag always buries its antlers after shedding them. Anyone who consumes the flesh of a Stag of Virtue gains a Lesser Immunity to fevers for Moon duration. The stag itself is immune to fevers and the venison transfers this immunity through the Law of Contagion.

The right antler of a Stag of Virtue may be Enriched by carving it into a cup, which every day for a season is filled with the blood and powdered skull of a viper. If filled with clear spring water with a leaf of dittany (a Necessary Condition), the cup neutralizes any poison (Greater Purifying Touch (Poison))

**Appearance:** A large elk with a pure white coat and an impressive rack of antlers. The White Stag does not ever shed its antlers as mundane deer do.

The White Stag of the Wood is a powerful magical elk that rules a large forest. The Stag prevents predators from over-hunting the forest and keeps other animal populations from outgrowing their food supply. The Stag selects the weakest animals when it must thin a herd, but attacks the pack leader when predators over-hunt their prey.

Although the local peasants tell stories of the Stag, and sighting it is seen as a sign of good luck, the White Stag only becomes concerned with humans when they hunt his woods. In most areas of Mythic Europe, only nobility are allowed to hunt deer. When the Stag encounters a noble who hunts too aggressively, the Stag presents himself to the noble and taunts him into chasing him. While the noble is futilely hunting the White Stag, the other deer remain safe. If this does not protect the herd, the Stag will treat the noble as it would any other predator.

The White Stag's antlers may be Enriched by wrapping them in the hide of the Stag under the light of a full moon. For one week, the bundle must be exposed to the light of the moon and may not touch the earth. At the end of the period, anyone holding both antlers is granted the Wilderness Sense Virtue with an Ability of 3.

## *Bestiary Story Seeds*

- *•* An avaricious magus has imported Ethiopian ants to mine gold for him, but now he cannot get the gold away from its guardians. He asks the covenant for help, but there are too many giant **Ants of Virtue** to simply defeat in battle.
- *•* Something has been cutting down trees in a faerie forest. The faeries blame neighboring humans (perhaps the covenant), but an **Antelope of Virtue** is actually responsible.
- *•* A magus who is over-fond of casting spells in public gets an unwanted admirer: an **Ape of Virtue** who begins mimicking his magical gestures. This is a minor annoyance until the ape begins stealing the magus's hat, robes, books, and Talisman in order to look more wizardly.
- *•* Magi want the balm from the **Asp of Virtue's** tree (or the gem from its forehead) and they learn of its vulnerability to music. How can they overcome its defense?
- *•* A **Beaver of Virtue** has constructed a giant dam downriver from the covenant, causing the the covenant to flood as the land it sits on is quickly submerged underneath an artificial lake.
- *•* The king of the **Bees of Virtue** refuses to pay tribute to the Lion of Virtue. Both rulers ask the magi to take sides in the conflict. See also "the Honey of Kings" in *Covenants*, page 75.
- *•* The crows in a magical area make it hard for the magi to hunt other Beasts of Virtue, because the crows keep warning beasts about the characters' traps and ambushes. Little do they know that

- this is actually a **Crow of Virtue**.
- *•* A peasant accidentally discovers that his dog can heal wounds with its tongue and he begins using it to help his neighbors. Once word of the "miraculous" dog spreads, thieves steal the **Dog of Virtue** and try to use it for profit. When the magi hear of this, do they try to return the dog to its owner, or take it for themselves? Keep in mind the dog's loyalty to its original master.
- *•* A ship carrying an important passenger has been wrecked. Some of the survivors saw a dolphin carrying that passenger away on its back. Where has the **Dolphin of Virtue** taken her?
- *•* Magi seek the fountain where **Eagles of Virtue** rejuvenate themselves, which they infer has magical properties. Following the eagles is, of course, easier said than done. Is the magic in the fountain, or in the eagle?
- *•* A hedge wizard has found a way to communicate with the **Echeneis of Virtue** and is now working closely with a band of pirates. The fish stops passing ships so the pirates can attack them.
- *•* A wise old elephant witnessed longago events of great interest to the magi. The characters must first find the proper elephant. Then the **Elephant of Virtue** insists they give it a mandrake root before it will cooperate.
- *•* A **Fox of Virtue** wants to get inside the covenant, but the *Aegis of the Hearth* keeps it out. So the fox pretends to be dead, hoping to be carried inside, where it then revives to wreak mischief.

The Owl can fly silently and has exceptional senses. It can see equally well at night or during the day. The Owl knows the woods very well and monitors the activities within them closely. The Owl questions the animals throughout the forest and shares what information she gathers, although most non-magical animals have little interest in her news.

The Owl can understand human speech. She generally avoids direct contact with humans, but is curious and will monitor them when they enter her wood. Because the Owl is only able to carry on a conversation with other intelligent animals, she is often bored and starved for conversation. She occasionally talks with magi who enter the wood, as she finds them more receptive to carrying on a discussion with a talking owl than others.

The owl's skull may be Enriched by boiling it in water with rare oils and sage until no flesh remains. The skull must then be kept at the highest point on the tallest tree in the forest in which the owl lived for one season. After that period, while the skull is hung around a character's neck, she possesses the Gift of Tongues Virtue.

## *Creatures from the Bestiaries*

Bestiaries (books about the characteristics and behavior of beasts) were a common literary form in the Middle Ages. Most medieval bestiaries are based on *Physiologus*, an anonymous first-century Greek manuscript. Medieval writers attributed remarkable powers and properties to certain animals. In **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition, only rare, Magical specimens (Beasts of Virtue) possess these magical qualities. The following short examples should help troupes design Beasts of Virtue for their own stories. See *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* (page 41) for several additional beasts of legend.

In Ethiopia are said to live **Ants of Virtue** that are the size of dogs. They dig up gold and guard it fiercely.

The **Antelope of Virtue** is very wild. Pierre de Beauvais writes that no hunter dares approach it. It has two horns, which are like saws and which can actually cut down trees when rubbed against them. But sometimes it gets its horns caught in a thicket and then becomes easy prey.

The **Ape of Virtue** loves to imitate men. Apes are found in Europe only in Iberia, near the Straits of Gibraltar (this animal, the Barbary ape, is actually a monkey and has a tail).

There are several types of **Asp of Virtue,**  distinguished by their venom: the *dipsa* makes one die of thirst, the *ypnalis* sends its victims to sleep, the *emorrosis* makes its victims sweat blood, and the venom of the *seps* devours the body and bones of its prey. All asps are easily charmed by music. When a musician tries to charm it, the asp plugs its ears by pressing one ear against the ground and inserting its tail into the other. Pierre de Beauvais writes that the asp guards a tree from which oozes a valuable balm. Other bestiaries say the asp has a gem called a carbuncle on its forehead.

The testicles of the male **Beaver of Virtue** have medicinal properties (and perhaps Creo vis). When hunted, the beaver castrates itself and throws its testicles to the hunter so it can escape with its life. The beaver is a gentle animal, but its teeth are so strong they can cut down trees, which it uses for building its dam.

**Bees of Virtue** are created spontaneously from the rotting carcasses of cattle. Maggots appear in the carcasses and later turn into bees. Despite these humble origins, bees come together to form a kind of model society. They work in common, building their homes with great skill and producing wax and honey. Each beehive is ruled by a king (not a queen).

![](_page_65_Picture_28.jpeg)

![](_page_66_Picture_1.jpeg)

There are many kinds of **Dog of Virtue.**  Medieval bestiaries usually portray the dog as a devoted companion of man. Dogs are considered to be among the most intelligent of beasts, for they can recognize their own names. A Magical dog may be able to heal wounds by licking them with its tongue, and binding a live Magical puppy to a patient's body can heal internal injuries. Body parts of a Dog of Virtue may have magical properties: medieval sources cite their usefulness in spells of warding.

The **Dolphin of Virtue** is the fastest fish in the ocean and is fond of racing alongside ships. Dolphins are friendly to man and sometimes rescue drowning sailors. They are very fond of music and will gather to listen. When they play and leap in heavy waves, it means a storm is coming soon.

The **Eagle of Virtue** has such wonderful eyesight that nothing can be hidden from its gaze. When the eagle is old, its wings grow heavy and its eyes grow dim. It then flies up to the sun to burn the feathers off its wings and the mist from its eyes. Then it dives three times into a fountain, after which it emerges, restored to health. Some eagles have a magical stone built into their nests (see Aetites in *Covenants,* page 82).

The **Echeneis (Remora) of Virtue** is a small fish, about six inches long, that can attach itself to ships. So great is its power that the ship is slowed to a standstill, no matter how strong the wind.

The **Elephant of Virtue** lives three hundred years and is very wise. The elephant is said never to forget. It is gentle by nature and sometimes aids lost travelers. Elephants must eat the root of the mandrake (see the Plants of Virtue section in Chapter 8, Magic Things) before they can mate.

The **Fox of Virtue** is full of trickery. It feigns death to attract carrion birds, then devours them. It never runs in a straight line. Fox kits are born as unformed, shapeless lumps of flesh until their mother licks them into shape.

The wild **Goat of Virtue** is the best climber of all the beasts and its eyesight is so keen it can distinguish hunters from simple travelers at a great distance. The he-goat is so full of lust that its blood is hot enough to dissolve even diamond.

The **Goose of Virtue** is a good watchman and can smell the scent of humans better than any other animal. In ancient times, geese alerted the city of Rome to an attack by the Gauls. The fat of a goose has medicinal properties.

## *Bestiary Story Seeds (con't)*

- *•* The magi befriend a sharp-eyed **Goat of Virtue** and convince it to keep a lookout for strangers in their territory. A rival covenant that is fond of trespassing makes an accusation of magical scrying.
- *•* The covenfolk begin raising geese, but to the magi's annoyance, one goose — the **Goose of Virtue** — will not stay quiet at night. This is because a stranger is prowling around the covenant after dark.
- *•* A magus wants to collect snow-fed hares from the Alps, perhaps as a vis source or perhaps to fulfill a Study Requirement (**ArM5**, page 59). This requires an expedition high into the mountains where the **Hare of Virtue** lives, under dangerous winter conditions.
- *•* Characters traveling through the forest at night encounter a **Hercinia of Virtue**, which assumes they are lost and tries to help them by leading them to the regio where it lives. Do the characters make a detour to follow the bird, and if so, can they find their way back?
- *•* An evil magus uses the blood of a **Hoopoe of Virtue** to dabble in black magic. Since the blood is not an Arcane Connection to its user, tracking down the real culprit may be difficult.
- *•* The **Kingfisher of Virtue** that traditionally nests near a seaside village has moved away and the villagers ask the magi to bring it back. What drove it away in the first place?
- *•* The covenant receives a windfall of gems when a **Lynx of Virtue** wanders into the nearby area. When they sell some of the gems, an outside magus obtains one and uses it as an Arcane Con-

- nection to capture the lynx for himself.
- *•* A character imprisoned in a dungeon is set free by a **Mouse of Virtue**, which magically appears from the earth and gnaws away the prisoner's fetters.
- *•* An **Owl of Virtue** is suspicious of the magi's intentions and sends other birds to spy on their activities.
- *•* A character whose familiar or animal companion has died learns of the pelican's power and seeks a **Pelican of Virtue** in the hope that it can revive any dead animal, not just its own chicks.
- *•* An ailing character is brought healing herbs by a **Weasel of Virtue**; later, the weasel asks for the character's help against serpents.
- *•* The magi hear rumors of a small island on which grow magical plants. The island is actually a **Whale of Virtue** that moves slowly about the seas, appearing in a different place each season. Over time, the whale leads the magi to strange new lands farther and farther from their home port.
- *•* A **Wolf of Virtue** has begun terrorizing lone travelers near the covenant. So far, no humans have been attacked, but the Redcaps demand the covenant deal with the menace.
- *•* One of the magi takes a **Woodpecker of Virtue** as a familiar. However, the bird has a tendency to escape its cage, and when it does it leaves a trail of destruction as every piece of wooden furniture it perches on promptly falls apart. When an interior wall of the main covenant house collapses during the latest jailbreak, the other magi have had enough.

The **Hare of Virtue** is light-footed, swift, and timid. It can change sex, so it is sometimes male and sometimes female. Pliny the Elder writes that the hares of the Alps subsist on snow throughout the winter, causing them to turn white.

The **Hercinia of Virtue** is a bird that dwells in the forest of southern Germany. Its feathers glow so brightly that at night they can light a traveler's path.

The **Hoopoe of Virtue** is a foul bird that builds its nest from filth and makes its home near cemeteries. Its blood and heart are powerful ingredients in black magic (see Objects of Virtue in Chapter Eight: Magic Things).

The **Kingfisher of Virtue** is called the halcyon in Latin. It lays its eggs by the seashore in mid-winter, at the height of the storm season. The sea then becomes calm for a period of two weeks; sailors are always grateful for these "halcyon days."

The **Lynx of Virtue** has keen vision. Its most unusual property is that its urine hardens into a semi-precious, flame-colored stone (called lyncuriam). The lynx always hides these stones by burying them.

The **Mouse of Virtue**, like the frog, can be born spontaneously from the soil. Pliny the Elder writes that some mice instinctively gnaw at iron, and that mice are the most pro-

![](_page_66_Picture_32.jpeg)

lific of all animals.

The **Owl of Virtue** can captivate other birds with its expression; if captured, the owl can charm its captors into setting it free. Seeing an owl during the daytime is widely thought to be a bad omen.

The **Pelican of Virtue** can revive its dead offspring. When the young pelicans are grown, they strike at their parent. The adult pelican grows angry and strikes back with excessive force, killing them. Then the parent pierces its side and sheds its blood over the dead fledglings, bringing them back to life.

The **Weasel of Virtue** is an unclean animal according to the Bible (Leviticus 11:29). Its foul stench pollutes the area around its hole. However, the weasel has an understanding of medicine and can even revive its young if they are killed. The weasel is an enemy to serpents and is the only animal that can kill a basilisk (though the weasel will also die).

The **Whale of Virtue** is even larger than a normal whale. From its mouth comes a sweet odor which draws small fish to their doom (larger fish recognize the danger and stay away). It basks in the sun for months or years at a time, until its back becomes covered with sand and even small plants. When sailors mistake the whale for an island and disembark, the whale awakens and dives into the sea.

The **Wolf of Virtue** is well known for its rapacity. It can live on anything: plants, soil, even the wind; but it hungers for flesh above all else. Should a wolf gaze upon its prey, the creature is paralyzed and struck dumb. The white wolves of House Tremere (see *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, page 129) are quite similar to Wolves of Virtue, except that a Wolf of Virtue has Cunning instead of Intelligence.

When the **Woodpecker of Virtue** perches on a tree, any nails or wedges driven into the tree immediately fall out. Woodpeckers were used for reading auguries in ancient Rome.

## *Birds of Nephelococcygia*

**Inherited Virtues:** Homing Instinct, Keen Vision, Lightning Reflexes.

**Inherited Flaws:** One or more Personality Flaws (Major or Minor, at the player's choice) should be assigned to the bird based on its type — finches have a Short Attention Span (**ArM5**, page 58), magpies are Avaricious (**ArM5**, page 51), eagles are Proud (**ArM5**, page 59), etc.

Nephelococcygia (neh-FEL-oh-cock-IG-ee-a) is a magic regio (with an aura of level 10) in the clouds, which is inhabited by intelligent birds. The birds are not Beasts of Virtue, and some, including their king, Tereus, claim to be men who were magically transformed into birds, but it is unclear whether this is true or not.

Within Nepheloccocygia is a city of the same name, constructed of nine concentric rings of walls. The walls, made of terracotta bricks liberally splashed with guano, increase in height as they near the center of the city, and contain many recessed nooks and alcoves in which the birds nest. In the city, a cacophony of birdcalls can be heard at all times, and Concentration rolls are at a penalty of –3.

At the city center is a spire, one thousand feet high, at the top of which King Tereus nests — he is an epops, a crested bird related to a kingfisher with a long beak, reddish-brown plumage, and black and white wing stripes. The outer wall of the city contains a single gate, barred with a large wooden door, and this must be used by earth-bound visitors who enter the regio. The gatekeeper is named Trochilus, and is a very small brown wren. He is rather scatter-brained, and while dealing with guests he nervously flutters back and forth between the gate and his king in the spire. Fortunately for Trochilus, earth-bound visitors to the regio are rare. Visitors who can fly, via whatever means, can bypass the gate,and are accorded much more respect by the birds.

To enter the regio of Nephelococcygia, a character must normally be guided by a bird. All Birds of Virtue know the current location of the regio and how to enter it, as do the Birds of Nephelococcygia themselves. Few mundane birds know the location of the regio, although many have heard of it, and no mundane bird knows how to enter the regio. The entrance to the regio of Nephelococcygia is in fact mobile — it moves about in the wind — but once the entrance has been found a character may predict the path of the regio over the next season if an Intelligence + Magic Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 9 is successful. Usually the regio entrance is located in the Thebes Tribunal, but it sometimes wanders over the Alps and into western Mythic Europe. Regardless of its geographical locale, the entrance to Nephelococcygia is always high in the air on the upper surface of a cloud, so to enter the regio a character must be able to fly, or be carried by a companion or creature that can fly.

Bird of Nephelococcygia characters of any season may be encountered outside the regio — most spring and summer characters leave the regio daily to greet the dawn, but older birds stay within the regio for long periods of time. In the middle of winter an Assembly of Birds is held, which must be attended by all Birds of Nephelococcygia; if a character does not attend he is ostracised by the other Birds of Nephelococcygia. Usually little of import is actually discussed at the Assembly, but new songs are performed and criticized in the weeks prior to the Assembly. Rehearsing new songs, and studying the songs of others, occupies a Bird of Nephelococcygia character for an entire season (this is one of the seasons normally unavailable to a companion character). Winter Bird of Nephelococcygia characters frequently have the Major Supernatural Virtue: Composer of Power.

## *Story Seed: Divine Gatekeepers*

According to the Greek playwright Aristophanes (*The Birds*: tractatus Quality 5 in Magic Lore), the city of Nephelococcygia was constructed to intercept communications between earth and heaven; the birds thus conspiring to insert themselves as gatekeepers of divine intervention. It is unclear whether this ever was true, and certainly the Divine is not now mediated by Nephelococcygia. Despite this, Philomena (a swallow who is the sister-in-law of Tereus, king of the birds) claimed in an interview, recorded at Durenmar over one hundred years ago, that Tereus' spire in the city does indeed contain records of prayers made over the centuries, which he has kept for reasons of his own. Philomena did not explain how the birds gained access to the prayers, or how the records were made, but finding answers to these questions might interest magi. Reputedly, Philomena was raped and had her tongue torn out by Tereus, so the interviewee may not have actually been Philomena; alternatively, she may have been healed and has told this tale to cause trouble for Tereus as revenge.

## **Powers of the Birds of Nephelococcygia**

**Command the Flock**

1 Point, Init: Qik–4, Animal R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

The character can trill commands to a group of up to 100 birds. The birds will try to obey any command that they can understand (mundane birds can understand commands equivalently to a dog), but they will not do anything obviously suicidal and if the birds have a Magic Resistance this power must Penetrate. The power lasts for a duration of Sun, and after this period the birds will act on their own initiative.

ReAn 35 (Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 cost)

**The Crow's Song**

2 Points, Init: Qik–4, Corpus

R: Voice, D: Special, T: Ind

The character sings this song at a target individual, and the next time the target sleeps an Aging Roll is made for him, adding 5 to the roll — even if he is too young to make Aging Rolls normally. This power must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance to be effective.

PeCo 40 (Base 15, +2 Voice, +3 Special Duration): Greater Power (40 levels, –2 cost)

**Air for Flying**

1 Point, Init: Qik–4, Auram

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Group

While the character sings this tune, the weather in the locale remains calm and temperate. This will also negate any magically created inclement weather where the magnitude of the effect that caused the inclement weather is less than the character's Might / 5 (round up). This power has a duration of concentration.

ReAu 35 (Base 5, +3 Sight, +1 Concen-

tration, +2 Group): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 cost)

**Call the Flock**

1 Point, Init: Qik–4, Animal

R: Special, D: Diameter, T: Group

If the character is in the open air, she may sing a song that summons a cloud of mundane birds about herself. From the next round, 10 birds arrive each round, every round over the next Diameter. The type of birds that arrive depends on the locale; at sea the birds will be mostly seagulls, shags, and shearwaters, for example. When they arrive, the birds attempt to gather about the character, attacking any other characters in the way. If they are not commanded to perform some task, the birds will slowly disperse over the next few hours. This power itself does not grant the character an intrinsic ability to command the flock.

ReAn 35 (Base 2, +4 special range, +1 diameter, + 2 Group +2 Size of Group): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 cost)

#### **Flight**

Birds of Nephelococcygia can fly. This is neither a Supernatural Ability nor a Power: the character's bones are hollow and light, he has powerful feathered wings, and he has a tail. He's a bird. Maneuvering is represented as a specialty of the Athletics Ability (**ArM5**, page 64). The character can normally take to the air without requiring a roll, and he has an initiative of Qik + Athletics (flying) for this maneuver. In extreme circumstances (during a storm, for example) a roll (Dexterity + Athletics(flying) + stress die) may be required to take to the air.

## *The Magical Lineages of Cats*

Three families of cats can trace their ancestry — through generations of familiars and Warped, intelligent ancestors — to the familiars of the Founders or their earliest apprentices. Each of these families, called lineages, has an oral history and a unique culture. They have many magical features that breed almost true, a feature unusual in magical animals.

#### **Black Lineage**

The Black Lineage of cats is descended from the Founder Jerbiton's familiar, a prince of the Egyptian cats, descended from the great queens of ancient Bubastis. The center of the Black Lineage is the domus magna of Jerbiton, Valnastium in the Tribunal of the Greater Alps, where their elected monarch reigns. But cats of this lineage have followed their magi to many covenants and cities across Europe. They are aristocratic, aloof cats. The members of the Black Lineage see their role as defenders of the home.

**Common Virtues (or Qualities):** Entrancement, Gossip, Greater Magical Power, Intuition, Lesser Magical Power, Luck, Magic Sensitivity, Piercing Gaze, Protection, Second Sight, Self–Confident, Strong Willed, True Faith, Wealthy (has human servants, gets 3 seasons per year to study).

**Common Flaws (or Inferiorities):** Busybody, Dependent (Place), Greedy, Meddler, Optimistic, Oversensitive, Proud, Temperate, Visions, Weakness.

**Common Magical Powers:** Aura of Rightful Authority, Fear of the Mouse, Prison for Mice and Birds, Prying Eyes, Warder's Walk.

#### **White Lineage**

The White Lineage is descended from the familiar of the Founder Mercere, and its members are found in his House's covenants. They are indulgent, friendly cats. They see their role as protectors of people. Many adopt a particular human to travel with.

**Common Virtues (or Qualities):** Common Sense, Ferocity, Greater Magical Power, Keen Vision, Lesser Magical Power, Lightning Reflexes, Premonitions, Rapid Convalescence, Second Sight, Shapeshifter (tool– using, bipedal form), Social Contacts, Tough, Warrior (adds to Brawl or conventional weapons in Shapeshifters), Well–traveled.

## *Cats as Example*

This section on cats demonstrates the method for constructing magical beasts. Storyguides designing parallel sets of powers for other species should borrow relevant powers from these lists, changing their names to suit the species they are creating. They should follow the same mechanical guidelines to create new powers. Ideas for powers can be found by researching the folklore of the species on the Internet — particularly on the sites of breeders — and by perusing medieval bestiaries. In the case of cats, this yields an enormous amount of material, much of which has been ignored because it is not known in 1220 Europe. For example, cat burning is a later practice.

**Common Flaws (or Inferiorities):** Busybody, Carefree, Compulsion (Territory), Dependent (Owner), Missing Ear, Missing Eye, Overconfident, Reckless.

**Common Magical Powers:** Cat Like a Shadow, Humans are Easily Misplaced, Inconspicuousness, True Sight of the Air

#### **Tortoiseshell Lineage**

This lineage of cats has been associated with Celtic spellcasters since before the formation of the Order. This lineage split into two groups following the Schism War, with a king of cats in both Scotland and the Rhineland. It may have had links to House Diedne. This lineage is most known for its capacity to predict the future.

Male tortoiseshells are very rare, and are more often magical than females. They tend to have mixed gender behaviors, which humans don't notice but are obvious and off-putting to other cats. If this plays a significant part in the campaign, then male tortoiseshells should take the Transvestite Flaw.

**Common Virtues (or Qualities):** Common Sense, Dowsing (does not need stick), Entrancement, Greater Magical Power, Faerie Blood, Ferocity, Gigantic, Keen Vision, Large, Lesser Magical Power, Lesser Purifying Touch (warts), Long–Winded, Premonitions, Reserves of Strength, Rapid Convalescence, Second Sight, Shapeshifter (human), Shapeshifter (if cat also has Large or Gigantic, can shift between two shapes), Wilderness Sense

**Common Flaws (or Inferiorities):** Magi-

## *Cat Character Template*

The unadjusted stats for cats are given in the Book of Mundane Beasts appendix. All of the Virtues, Flaws, Abilities and Qualities noted there should, in most cases, be purchased before other items of the same type, when creating a character.

To demonstrate the process of creation, the following template has additions due to the creature's magical nature marked in **bold italic.**

**Magic Might: 13 (Animal)** (assuming a companion role in medium-power saga and adjusted by Size)

**Characteristics: Int** 0 (Intelligence is a free choice for magical animals)

**Confidence Score: 1(3)** (This is the default score for magical beings)

**Virtues and Flaws: Magic Animal,** Perfect Balance, Puissant Awareness, Sharp Ears, **Unaffected by the Gift, Magical Friend,** Nocturnal **(requires 2 Flaws to balance Virtues).**

**Qualities:** Ambush Predator, Crafty, Good Jumper, Skilled Climber, Thick Fur. (Cats may have 10 points of Qualities; they get a +3 bonus to Might from small Size, but this does not increase the number of Qualities available. Qualities may include General or Supernatural Minor Virtues, so suggested Virtues provided in later lists are sometimes suited as Qualities instead. Similarly, the Flaw lists may give ideas for Inferiorities.) (The natural Qualities of magical animals are not usually recorded on their

character sheets.) **Personality Traits:** Curious +4, **Cat +3\*,**  Timid +2 (Most magical things have a Personality Trait of +3 representing their basic nature)

(The basic cat has 195 experience. A creature of Summer season begins with 360 experience)

**Vis: 3 pawns, Animal, in eyes.** (Might divided by 5, rounded up)

![](_page_69_Picture_32.jpeg)

![](_page_70_Picture_0.jpeg)

cal Air, Feral Upbringing, Judged Unfairly, Reclusive, Transvestite (male cats of this color are extremely rare, and tend to have feminine behaviors).

**Common Magical Powers:** Suckle Cows Dry, Lay to Rest the Haunting Spirit, Master of the Undergrowth, Unmarked Passage, Whispers Through the Black Gate.

## *Magical Powers*

Players designing cats select one magical power for each purchase of the Greater Magical Power or Lesser Magical Power Qualities. Each of these Qualities may be purchased multiple times. Any cat may purchase any power, but some are seen frequently in cats of a certain lineage. Powers frequently seen in a certain tribe of cats are listed in the lineage descriptions, above.

## *Cats' Greater or Lesser Magical Powers*

All Greater and Lesser Powers for the magical lineages of cats have:

- A cost in spell levels for character creation, given just before the detail that explains the spell level.
- A Penetration Score = Might of the cat (5 x the cost of the power) + the cat's Penetration Bonus. This bonus has not been calculated for the sample powers below.

The Might point cost given is for a Lesser version of the power. For a Greater version, halve it, rounding up.

The Initiative Bonus for a Lesser Power is equal to the cat's Quickness – (Magnitude x 2). For a Greater Power, the Initiative Bonus is equal to the cat's Quickness – (Magnitude/2).

#### **Aura of Rightful Authority**

4 points, Mentem

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

This effect is used to overcome the shock caused by talking cats. It also inclines humans to obey orders. (**ArM5**, page 151)

(20 spell levels: Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

#### **Blackberry Cat**

or *Feigned Innocence*, 5 points, Mentem R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Group

This causes a Group of people to forget

something the cat did, much as the spell *Loss of But A Moment's Memory* does (**ArM5**, page 151). The name comes from the belief that cats born in blackberry season have mischief in them.

(25 spell levels: Base 10, +1 Eye, +2 Group)

#### **Curse of Rheumatism**

2 points, Corpus

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

If a person touches the cat, he develops rheumatism in that limb. This power is traditionally used on those who kick cats.

(10 spell levels: Base 5, as per laming in table on **ArM5**, page 133, + 1 Touch)

#### **Drain Energy**

3 points, Corpus

R: Touch or Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind

This power, similar to *Invocation of Weariness* (**ArM5**, page 133), has either a Touch or Eye Range; it varies by cat.

(15 spell levels: Base 10, +1 Touch or Eye)

#### **Fear of the Mouse**

3 points, Mentem

R: Eye, D: Sun T: Ind

This power, similar to *Panic of the Trembling Heart* (**ArM5**, page 148) is often used to make people afraid of the cat. Many cats have alternative emotional effects.

(15 spell levels: Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

#### **Feline Lullaby**

or *Keeping the Humans Safely Tucked Away*, 2 points, Mentem

R: Voice, D: Mom T: Ind

#### **Humans are Easily Misplaced**

4 points, Corpus

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

A version of *Inexorable Search* (**ArM5**, page 131). The maps cats use are a mixture of scents and textures, and make little sense to humans. This requires an Arcane Connection, so cats often scent–mark humans they wish to find again by rubbing on them.

(20 spell levels: Base 3, +4 Arc, +1 Conc)

#### **Incredibly Cute**

2 points, Mentem

R: Touch or Eye, D: Diam T: Ind

This ability, similar to *Trust of Childlike Faith* (**ArM5**, page 150) allows the cat to become so endearing that it impairs the rationality of others. Some cats have an Eye contact version of this ability, while others have a Touch Ranged power, triggered by stroking the cat.

(10 spell levels: Base 4, +1 Eye or Touch, +1 Diam)

#### **Mackerel Sky**

4 points, Auram

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group

(5 spell levels: Base 3, +1 Touch +1 Diam.)

#### **Prison for Mice and Birds**

1 point, Animal

R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle

This is a version of *Circle of Beast Warding* (**ArM5**, page 120). It is sometimes used in conjunction with the Greater Magical Powers, described below.

(5 spell levels: Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Ring)

#### **Prying Eyes**

1 point, Imaginem

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Room

This effect is used to look inside buildings and rooms while patrolling a house or town. Note that a cat touching the roof of a room can see inside it. (**ArM5**, page 144).

(5 spell levels: Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Conc +2 Room)

![](_page_70_Picture_86.jpeg)

**Suck the Breath**

3 points, Corpus

R: Eye or Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The cat causes an asthma attack with the same effects as *Grip of the Choking Hand* (**ArM5**, page 133) but with either Eye or Touch range (choose when the cat is created.)

(15 spell levels: Base 10, +1 Eye or Touch)

**Suckle Cows Dry**

3 points, Animal

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

This power is used to make a cow lactate while a cat suckles from its udders. Cats filling themselves with milk often find it difficult to maintain concentration, so it is common to find cats working in groups, to restrain a cow in turns.

(15 spell levels: Base 5, + 1 Touch, +1 Conc)

**Suffocate the Dead**

Cost equals (Magnitude / 5), Mentem R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Some cats can create an effect similar to *Lay to Rest the Haunting Spirit* (**ArM5**, page 150) by sitting or sleeping on the ghost's grave. If several cats sleep on the same grave their Penetration scores are added together, and the highest level effect applies, so even powerful ghosts can be destroyed this way, with sufficient co-operation and persistence. This does not require Warder's Walk, although no one is sure why.

(Spell levels vary. Base Effect)

**Viper's Gaze**

3 points, Animal

R: Eye, D: Conc, T: Ind

A variant of the spell of the same name (**ArM5**, page 120), used to immobilize prey.

(15 spell levels: Base 5, +1 Eye, +1 Concentration)

**Wake the Dead**

4 points, Corpus

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

Some cats are able to animate corpses by leaping over them, a power similar to a Touch Ranged version of *Awaken the Slumbering Corpse*  (**ArM5**, page 134)*.* Reports of this power are most common in Eastern Europe, and may refer to Infernally tainted cats. Some cats claim to be able to wake the dead with their nightly singing, but this may be a metaphor.

![](_page_71_Picture_25.jpeg)

**Warder's Walk**

Magnitude points, Vim.

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group

Cats in the Black Lineage use this power to combine their other powers. This allows their rituals to penetrate the Magic Resistance of creatures they wish to ward. It is a variant of *Wizard's Communion.* Use of the Warder's Walk is dangerous, as the addition of too many cats makes a fatal botch very likely, so the cats use this power sparingly.

(Spell levels vary by base effect.)

**Whispers Through the Black Gate**

3 points, Corpus

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

The ability to talk to corpses is found most often in tortoiseshells (**ArM5**, page 130).

(15 spell levels: Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, no cost for requisite)

#### **Black Cat Wards**

The Black Cats that serve House Jerbiton have a group of powers that they use to defend a home, or even a small settlement, from minor faeries and demons. Each cat is likely to have only one of these abilities, so groups of cats, each with a separate ability, will often walk the bounds of their settlement to lay multiple protective barriers. Some of these powers are also found in the other lineages, but the Black habit of marching in procession around the border of a protected space is not found in the other lineages. The Black Lineage is also most likely to use Warder's Walk, a Power that allows for wards of greater Magnitude.

The protective powers often available to cats of the Black Lineage include simulations of the following spells. Various cats have differing Magnitudes in these powers.

**Circular Ward Against Demons**

Magnitude points, Vim

R: Touch, T: Ring, D: Circle

See **ArM5**, page 162 for a fuller description of this effect.

(Spell levels vary by base spell)

**Ward Against Beasts of Legend**

Magnitude points, Animal

R: Touch, T: Ring, D: Circle

See **ArM5**, page 120 for a fuller description of this effect.

(Spell levels vary by base spell)

![](_page_71_Picture_49.jpeg)

![](_page_72_Picture_0.jpeg)

![](_page_72_Picture_1.jpeg)

See **ArM5**, page 138 for a fuller description of this effect.

(Spell levels vary by base spell)

**Ring of Warding Against Spirits** Magnitude points, Mentem R: Touch, T: Ring, D: Circle See **ArM5**, page 151 for a fuller description of this effect.

(Spell levels vary by base spell)

Cats with other wards that contain fire, protect from poor weather, and exclude crop rusts have also been frequently reported.

## *Personal Magical Powers for Cats*

All Personal Powers for the magical lineages of cats have:

- An Initiative bonus equal to the cat's Quickness – (Magnitude /2).
- A cost in spell levels for character creation, given just before the detail the explains the spell level.
- A Penetration Score = Might of the cat – (5 x the cost of the power) + the cat's Penetration Bonus. This bonus has not been calculated for the sample powers below.

**Cat Like <sup>a</sup> Shadow**

2 points, Init: Qik –1, Imaginem

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

A version of the spell *Trackless Step* (**ArM5**, page 155).

(20 spell levels: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 for constant effect)

## *Dragons and Dragon-kind*

Dragons are the largest and most fearsome of mortal creatures. They are renowned for their cunning, wickedness, and lust for treasure. Related to dragons, but less powerful, are a variety of reptilian creatures: the serpents, drakes, and worms.

**Serpents** are the least of the dragons' kin, little more than glorified snakes. They almost always have a venomous bite or sting. In addition, many have the power to entrance their victims. Basilisks (see *Guardians of the Forest*, page 61) are the mightiest of serpents. Mundanes use the term "serpent" interchangeably to refer to both dragons and snakes; when magi use the term strictly, they are referring to a snake-like supernatural creature that has no exact mundane counterpart.

**Drakes** are caricatures of dragons, usually misshapen in some way. They tend to be less intelligent than true dragons, but may possess a certain predatory cunning. All drakes have legs (either two or four) and many have wings, though frequently their wings are too stunted for actual flight. A few drakes have multiple heads. Drakes usually have dangerous breath, which may be fiery, poisonous, or cause disease. Magi in the far north of Mythic Europe have reported colddwelling drakes that breathe a deadly frost instead of fire. The smallest drakes are no bigger than a chicken, while the largest can outweigh an elephant.

**Worms** are like huge serpents; indeed, some magi believe serpents and worms are two names for the same class of creatures. Worms sometimes have stunted legs or wings, but their primary means of locomotion is slithering like a snake. Worms are typically venomous and some can exhale a cloud of poisonous or pestilential fumes. Others breathe fire. In addition to biting, most of them are able to crush or suffocate victims in their deadly coils.

True **dragons** are mighty and wily opponents. They are intelligent — sometimes more intelligent than magi — and this intelligence can be their greatest weapon against mortals foolhardy enough to challenge them. True dragons have four legs and a pair of bat-like wings (which may or may not be functional).

Dragon's powers may include the deadly breath, entrancing gaze, or venom shared by their lesser kin. The more powerful dragons can also change shape, create illusions, or produce other magical effects. The smallest true dragons are somewhat smaller than an adult human, while the largest can be as big as a castle. Stellatus (on page 194 of **ArM5**) is on the small side for a dragon at Size +8.

Slaying a major dragon is a feat worthy of legend, a suitable challenge for a whole covenant of senior wizards. The largest dragons are so physically powerful, they are beyond anything the rules of **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition can represent. Such creatures are too big and too well-armored in iron-hard scales to be harmed by mortal weapons. Characters should have to come up with an innovative plan to defeat such a mighty opponent: perhaps questing for a legendary weapon, or searching the Magic Realm for lore that reveals the dragon's hidden weakness.

![](_page_72_Picture_53.jpeg)

## *Dragons as Characters*

While the classic dragon is much too powerful to use as a player character, one can create a fairly weak dragon using the rules in Chapter 4: Magic Characters, suitable for use as a grog, companion, or magus-equivalent character — or as a character's Magical (Being) Companion. For dragons meant as non-player characters, it's not necessary to strictly obey the **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition character-creation rules; for instance, there's no need to make sure a mighty dragon's Virtues are all properly balanced with Flaws. Dragons are supposed to be powerful.

## **Concept**

Dragons and their kin have base Characteristics of 0, and 7 points to spend on improving Characteristics (like human characters).

The base Size of all dragons and dragon-kind is at least 0. This can be adjusted by choosing appropriate Virtues or Flaws, or Inferiorities for small dragon-kind. In addition, the base Size can be any Size greater than 0. This adjusts Quickness and Strength as described under the Gigantic Quality, but the character does not need to buy that Quality.

All dragons, and their lesser kin, should begin with the special Virtue, Magic Animal.

Most dragon-kind have the Minor Magic Quality Gift of Speech.

Suggested Virtues for dragons include: Entrancement, Greater Immunity (to fire or poison), Magic Sensitivity, Premonitions, Second Sight, Arcane Lore, Enduring Constitution, Great Characteristic, Improved Characteristics, Lightning Reflexes, Piercing Gaze, Puissant Ability, Self-Confident, Strong-Willed, Magical Champion, Magical Master, (Form) Resistance

Suggested Flaws include Avaricious (major), Magical Monster, Magical Air, Magical Bane, Oversensitive, Nocturnal, Offensive to Animals, Infamous, Essential Flaw.

#### **Season and Abilities**

Dragons and their kin may be of any Season. Serpents are more likely to be Spring characters than are other dragon-kind, and true dragons are more likely to be Winter than their lesser relatives.

If the creature is intended as a combat opponent, it is important for it to have a good Brawl skill. Its combat statistics may be further improved through Qualities.

#### **Might Score and Qualities**

If the dragon is to be one of the player characters or their close associates, assign a Might score according to the desired power level of the Saga (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Magic Character Creation).

The Might scores of other dragons and dragon-kind should fall into the following general ranges:

## *Character Guide: A Scitalis*

**Magic Might:** 5 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Cun +1, Per +2, Pre +4, Com –3, Str –2, Sta +2, Dex 0, Qik –2

**Size:** –2

**Season:** Spring

**Magic Qualities and Inferiorities:** Greater Power (x2); Improved Might, Improved Powers, Improved Soak; Miniature; Susceptible to Deprivation

**Personality Traits:** Lethargic +2, Territorial +2

**Combat:**

*Fangs:* Init –2, Attack +7, Defense +3, Damage –1

**Soak:** +4

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Abilities:** Brawl 3 (fangs), Ignem Resistance 3 (cold), Survival 2 (winter)

**Powers:**

*Dazzling Appearance*, 0 points, Init –3, Mentem or Animal

R:Per, D: Conc, T: Spectacle

The scitalis can use its wondrous colors and appearance to stupefy those who look at it. Victims stand in slack-jawed amazement, unable to move, speak, or act, for as long as the scitalis concentrates. It uses this power to capture its prey, for it is a slow-moving creature. ReMe(An) 45 (Base 15, +1 Conc, +4 Spectacle, +1 Animal requisite): Greater Power (45 levels, –1 Might cost), Improved Powers (–3 Might cost), Greater Power (partial, –1 Might cost)

*Venom*, 0 points, Init n/a, Aquam

R:Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

The scitalis' fangs drip a venom that causes a Medium Wound (if it penetrates Magic Resistance) unless its victim can make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9.

CrAq 30 (Base 10, +2 Sun, +1 continuous effect): Greater Power (partial, 30 levels, –3 Might cost)

**Vis:** 1 Imaginem in skin

**Appearance:** The scitalis is a large snake, about six feet long and as thick as a man's arm. Its scales are patterned in a variety of spectacular colors.

The scitalis is a slow-moving serpent that relies on its marvelous appearance to stun its prey. The scitalis usually hunts by hiding near a water source or game trail. It usually preys on small animals, but has been known to attack humans if it feels threatened. Unlike mundane snakes, the blood of the scitalis is hot, enabling the serpent to remain active throughout the winter months.

This character guide may be used "as is" for a brief encounter, or developed into a finished character by adding 4 points of Virtues to balance its current Flaws (plus additional Virtues and Flaws, if desired) and 50 Experience Points in Abilities.

Serpent

Dragons should choose Qualities for any special attacks they possess; the Improved Powers Quality is also a good choice to help

reduce the cost (and boost the Penetration)

of their breath or gaze.

A dragon's combat statistics may be improved through liberal use of the Improved Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Damage, and Improved Soak Qualities. It is especially important to enhance the Defense scores of very large dragons, because otherwise their poor Quickness scores (due to the effects of their Size) will make them vulnerable.

CrIg 35 (Base 15, +2 Voice, +2 Group): Greater Power (35 levels, –1 Might cost)

**Vis:** 3 Ignem in heart

**Appearance:** Varkos is a misshapen dragon with a a build like a bulldog's: massive shoulders and smaller hindquarters. His head is crocodile-like and has a pronounced underbite. His bat-like wings are ridiculously small, but he sometimes flaps them furiously in a vain attempt to fly. He has a spiny ridge running from his forehead all along his body, but the spines poke out drunkenly in different directions.

Varkos is a fire drake who desperately wants to be thought of as a fearsome dragon. He knows quite a bit about dragon stories, and tries his best to act like the dragons of legend. (His treasure hoard is coming along nicely; it's almost big enough to fill two hand baskets.) Varkos lives in a cave overlooking a mountain pass, from which he ventures forth to prey upon livestock and set the occasional haystack on fire. He usually tries to scare away humans rather than hurt them; dead men tell no tales, and Varkos is working hard to build up a reputation. Lately he has worked up enough nerve to start robbing travelers of their treasure, and is looking forward to the time when terrified villagers will bring him his first virgin sacrifice. (He has no idea what exactly a virgin is or what real dragons are supposed to do with them.)

One of the reasons Varkos tries so hard to be terrifying is that he wants to attract a

## *Claw and Fang*

The weapon statistics for a dragon's claws and teeth as are follows. Dragons larger than Size +2 usually have large claws and/or large teeth.

| Init | Atk | Dfn | Dam |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| –1   | +2  | +3  | +2  |

mate. Living in a cave in the mountains can be lonely and rather boring. He enjoys his encounters with humans because they give him a chance to talk to someone, however briefly. Unfortunately, Varkos is not the best conversationalist; he is mostly interested in hearing stories about dragons. Characters might be able to befriend him if they pretend to be afraid of him, tell some entertaining stories, and promise to spread wild tales about how they met the "dragon of the mountains" and barely escaped with their lives.

## *Option: Constriction Attacks*

Medieval bestiaries speak of dragons strangling elephants with their tails or coils. Many dragons and their lesser kin can attack by constriction. This ability is especially common among worms and large serpents. The following constriction rules are optional. If you prefer to keep combat uncomplicated, simply ignore the constriction attacks listed for dragons in this chapter.

A dragon can only constrict a victim whose Size is less than its own. Constriction is based on the grappling rules (see "Non-Lethal Combat" on page 174 of **ArM5**). The Attack Total is computed using the Brawl skill, and a constriction attack has the following weapon statistics: Init 0, Atk +3, Dfn 0, Dam n/a

As long as the dragon maintains the grapple, its opponent is considered deprived of air (see **ArM5**, page 180). The victim must make a Stamina check every 30 seconds, that is, every five rounds, or suffer the normal effects of deprivation. Constriction is a slow way to slay an opponent.

Once the dragon has successfully grappled an opponent (and begun constricting), on subsequent rounds it can continue constricting and still attack with its claws or bite. These attacks may be directed at the grappled victim, or at another opponent.

By gazing into a person's eyes, Arkliss can bend him to her will. The victim will carry out one verbal command to the best of his ability, but he must be able to understand Arlkiss's orders. People do not normally want to make eye contact with Arkliss, however. To use this power, she must catch her victim by surprise. ReMe 40 (Base 20, +1 Eye, +3 Moon):

**Vis:** 4 Vim in brain

**Appearance:** Arkliss is a true dragon about the size of a man. Her wide jaws are full of sharp teeth; she has large, bat-like wings and a barbed tail. She has a forked tongue with which she tastes the air as a snake does.

Arkliss is a small but fierce dragon who makes her lair at the bottom of a bog near the middle of a large swamp. She can survive on waterfowl and frogs but much prefers red meat. Nearby peasants attempt to placate her with offerings of sheep and goats, but Arkliss is perfectly willing to hunt for herself.

Arkliss used 1 mastery point from her Improved Powers Quality on her *Lungs of the Fish* power and 1 on *Domination,* and spent the remaining 3 points on 15 xp in Penetration.

## **Polymathes, the Draconic Librarian**

**Magic Might:** 41 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Int +5, Per +4, Pre +8, Com +3, Str +12, Sta +8, Dex +3, Qik –4

## *Dragon Story Seeds*

#### **A Scintillating Serpent**

En route to visit an important magus or noble, the characters stumble upon a scitalis, which tries to bite them as they stand spellbound. Little do they know that the scitalis was a warning from benevolent forces, as it foreshadows their upcoming visit: when they arrive at their destination, their host tries to impress them with lavish gifts and hospitality, while secretly planning to take advantage of them.

#### **The Less-Than-Deadly "Dragon"**

The characters are waylaid by Varkos the fire drake, who demands all their treasure. They strike up a conversation with the "dragon" and Varkos enjoys it so much he forgets to rob them. Later, the characters learn of a young knight out to build a reputation by slaying the "dragon of the mountains." The knight has obtained a magical ointment to protect himself from flames, so a battle between him and Varkos could be an even match. Can the characters prevent a deadly fight?

#### **A Slippery Thief**

Like most dragons, Arkliss is obsessed with treasure. She has come up with a plan to rob the wealthiest estate in her district — which just happens to be the player characters' covenant. She sends several Dominated peasants inside the walls, posing as peddlers or pilgrims. At midnight Arkliss arrives, using her Domination power to neutralize any watchmen so her minions can loot the place of valuables. Arkliss does not know anything about enchanted items, but if she learns through her minions how highly the magi value such things, she makes a special effort to steal them for her hoard.

#### **A Covetous Creature**

The magi and their companions are enjoying the hospitality of a local noble, when suddenly the feasting hall shakes violently, and a roar like thunder rolls out across the valley. Unknown to them, a lindwurm witnessed their approach and caught a glimpse of an especially rich item among their belongings. The beast wants this item for itself, and won't release its hostages until the item is given up.

#### **The Serpent's Scribe**

Polymathes the draconic librarian has acquired a few Hermetic books over the years, and has decided it's time to expand his collection. A true connoisseur, he wants only books of high Quality. He is certainly not willing to trade away anything from his own collection, but he would let someone come to his lair and copy a book in exchange for a new tome as payment. If the copyist does a good job, Polymathes decides to employ that person (indefinitely) to copy and trade more Hermetic books. Being a dragon, he does not phrase this as a request.

Anyone caught in its path takes a stress die +45 damage from the flames; a character may attempt to dodge with a Qik + Athletics roll; if the roll succeeds against an Ease Factor of 12, the character is only singed for a stress die +15 damage. CrIg 50 (Base 40, +2 Voice): Greater Power (50 levels), Improved Powers

*Peering Into the Mortal Mind*, 2 points, Init +3, Mentem

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

(partial, –3 Might cost)

As the spell on page 149 of **ArM5**, but Polymathes can read the mind of anyone he can see; the target does not need to make eye contact with him.

InMe 40 (Base 25, +3 Sight): Greater Power (40 levels, –2 Might cost)

*Poisonous Blood,* 0 points, Init n/a, Aquam

Polymathes's blood is a deadly poison that keeps its potency for nine days after it is spilled. If anyone should manage to inflict a wound on Polymathes, and later in the battle rolls a botch, then a drop of blood has hit the unfortunate character's skin, and the player must make a Stamina roll of 12+ or the character dies instantly. CrAq 45 (Base 25, +3 Duration equivalent to Moon, +1 continuous effect): Greater Power (45 levels, –1 Might cost), Improved Powers (partial, –3 Might cost), Improved Powers (partial, –1 Might cost)

Improved Powers (partial, 15xp in Penetration) **Vis:** 9 Intellego in heart

**Appearance:** Polymathes resembles a squat lizard about 25 feet from shoulder to rump, with a thin, sinuous neck about 15 feet long and a whip-like tail of similar length. He is covered in shimmering golden scales that are has hard as iron. His large wings are graceful and flexible, and he has the habit of gesticulating with them when he gets excited, to the detriment of bystanders.

Polymathes is something of a runt among dragons, but he is very ancient and magically potent. He lairs in a complex of tunnels in a remote mountain range, emerging every decade or two in search of new treasures. His lair is a place of wondrous illusions where nothing is what it seems. One of his favorite tricks is to make a pile of rubble

![](_page_76_Picture_27.jpeg)

resemble a gleaming mound of gold; when would-be thieves discover the illusion, they usually decide the rumored dragon treasure was some kind of hoax, and give up. When he decides it would be amusing to deal with intruders in person, he disguises himself as a huge boulder and positions himself so intruders literally have to climb over him to get the "treasure."

Polymathes is as consumed by lust for treasure as any of his kind. However, the wealth he craves is not money, but knowledge. He has a magnificent hoard of rare books and scrolls, some of them very ancient. There are a few tens of thousands of gold coins as well, collected in Polymathes' younger days before he could appreciate the finer things in life. He has carefully arranged his treasures in piles and sleeps coiled among them. He does read the books from time to time (hence his smattering of Academic Abilities), but he's primarily interested as a collector. He is preoccupied with expanding his collection, by whatever means are convenient. (It would be highly inadvisable to mention the Great Library of Durenmar in his presence.)

The lindwurm can breathe a cloud of black smoke five paces across that coats victims with a contact poison (Ease Factor 9, inflicts a Heavy wound).

CrAu 35 (Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter, +2 Group): Greater Power (35 levels, +1 Init, –2 Might cost)

*Venomous Bite*, 0 points, Init n/a, Aquam R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

> The bite of the lindwurm has the same toxic effects as its breath, but costs no Might points to use.

> CrAq 35 (Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 continuous effect): Personal Power x2 (35 levels, –3 Might cost), Improved Powers (–1 Might cost, 20 xp Penetration)

**Vis:** 3 Perdo in fangs

**Appearance:** The lindwurm is a huge, batwinged worm about 60 feet long and as thick as a barrel. It has cat-like eyes that shine through the darkness. Some lindwurms have a mane like a lion, though their faces are always reptilian. Their thick, overlapping scales gleam brilliant green with gold or silver highlights.

The *lindwurm* is a legless worm that appears in sagas and folk tales from Germany and Scandinavia (where it is called the *lindorm*). Lindwurms dwell in rivers, caverns, or burial mounds. They feed on sheep and cattle and are also fond of human corpses; sometimes lindwurms tunnel into churchyards to devour the newly buried dead.

Lindwurms are consumed by a lust for riches. They can often be found guarding vast hoards of treasure. Sometimes they resort to taking hostages for ransom: they coil around the hall of a wealthy noble, devouring anyone who attempts to enter or leave, until a heavy ransom is paid — or until some hero arrives to slay the monster.

This character guide may be used "as is" or completed in detail by adding up to 4 points of Virtues and Flaws and 175 Experience Points in Abilities. For a morepowerful lindwurm, add Might and Qualities as well.

## *Transformed Animals*

Powerful mystical effects cause Warping to both people and beasts. Hermetic magi often use the term Transformed Animal to classify those animals that have become Warped by magic. Hermetic taxonomists mark an important distinction between Transformed Animals and other beasts with magic qualities, like Beasts of Virtue: the magical qualities manifested by a Transformed Animal are entirely unrelated to the natural qualities of the beast, but are instead intimately related to the magical event that caused the transformation. Transformed Animals also do not gain a Magic Might score from their transformation, and thus do not become creatures native to the Magic realm.

## *Warping*

Animals gain Warping points in the same manner as people (**ArM5**, pages 167- 168). Once an animal gains a Warping score of 1 it acquires a Minor Flaw, and it gains another Minor Flaw when its Warping score reaches 3. When the Warping Score reaches 5 a Minor Virtue is gained, and subsequent increases in the Warping Score result in the acquisition of Major Flaws. Note that an Animal that acquires a Minor Virtue (as it has reached a Warping Score of 5), no longer gains Warping points merely due to exposure to the same sort of aura.

## **Virtues and Flaws from Warping**

If the Warping points gained by an

![](_page_77_Picture_41.jpeg)

![](_page_78_Picture_0.jpeg)

animal are mostly due to Magic — rather than Divine, Faerie, or Infernal influences — then it may acquire the following Virtues and Flaws as it Warps, eventually acquiring a Lesser Power when it reaches a Warping Score of 5. See Chapter 4: Characters for details of these Virtues and Flaws.

Minor Supernatural Flaw: Warped Senses Minor Supernatural Flaw: (Form) Monstrosity Minor Supernatural Virtue: Lesser Power Major Supernatural Flaw:

Hunger for (Form) Magic Major Supernatural Flaw: Bound to Magic

## *Example Warped Animals*

Below are some examples of animals that have been transformed due to exposure to magic. Note that until an animal has become so Warped that it acquires a Warping Score of 5, it only gains Flaws due to magical exposure, and many animals do not have a long enough life span to reach such a score.

#### **The Cat-Fish (Felis Aquatica)**

**Characteristics:** Cun 0, Per +1, Pre –4, Com –5, Str –7, Sta 0, Dex +3, Qik+4

#### **Natural Weapons:**

*Claws:* Init –1, Attack +2, Defense +3, Damage +2. Teeth: Init 0, Attack +3, Defense +1, Damage +1. The cat's dense fur gives it a Protection of +1.

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Muto vis in fish tail.

## *Magic*

**Appearance:** The fore-part of the cat-fish is that of a black cat, and the back-part is that of a silvery fish. His favorite hunting method is to hide under the surface of the water, and grab small vermin nesting in the banks of the river. Sometimes he will chase a fish on a line, but this is more of a kitten-like regression than serious hunting. Like all cats, the cat-fish gains a +3 bonus on rolls to climb and jump, due to his Perfect Balance, although of course he cannot easily climb out of the water. The cat does not have gills, and so cannot breath underwater.

Village fishermen in Champagne tell stories of a cat that lives in a tributary of the river Seine. The cat, it is claimed, is half fish — a kind of feline mermaid — and is very bold, sometimes even stealing fish from the line.

The Bonisagus magus Yonnlius, currently a Master in the Rhine Tribunal, claims to have caught the cat several years ago and examined it. His supposition is that a cat became Warped after falling into a powerful magical regio in the river Seine, while attempting to catch fish from the river bank. It is unclear, from the record held at Durenmar, whether Yonnlius also located this regio, although he does note that upon the completion of his study the animal was released unharmed.

#### **The Dog that Flew (Canis Volata)**

## *Minor Covenant Hook: Warped Livestock*

The covenant has a large population of animals that have been Warped by a long association with the covenant. A minority of the animals have unusual and useful powers, but the presence of monsters draws mundane attention and suspicion to the covenant. If the population of monstrosities is large enough, the animals may be farmed to provide a source of Muto vis — this is represented by assigning an appropriate vis source Boon to the covenant.

## *Intentionally Warping an Animal*

A cage of change is an enchanted item that is intended to rapidly Warp an animal, causing it to become monstrous by using an effect similar to *The Enigma's Gift* (**ArM5**, page 157). This is done in the hope that the animal may then be slain and harvested for Muto vis. Using a cage of change is considered an unpleasant act by most magi, and many Bjornaer and Merinita magi consider the device abhorrent.

#### **Cage of Change**

CrVi Level 30 Pen +0, 1/day R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The cage of change is an iron cage large enough to hold captive an animal of Size +1. When activated, the cage gives the captive in the cage 5 Warping Points — which is normally enough to cause the captive to gain a Warping Score of 1, and a Minor Flaw (**ArM5**, page 167-168). The intention is that the animal gains the Minor Supernatural Flaw (Form) Monstrosity, but there is no guarantee that a particular Flaw will be acquired by the animal, and other Flaws could cause the animal to become difficult to control or even dangerous. A Hermetic magus caught in a version of the cage of change that has been designed with penetration may instead enter Wizard's Twilight (**ArM5**, page 88).

**Abilities:** Athletics 4 (aerial maneuvers), Awareness 4 (keeping watch), Brawl 3 (bite), Hunt 4 (track by scent)

**Natural Weapons:** The weapon statistics for a dog's bite are Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1.

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Muto in wing feathers.

**Appearance:** The dog is lean, lanky, and hungry looking. She stands about 3 feet tall, and has a large pair of grey feathered wings, with an extended wing span of over 3 yards; although normally the wings are tucked tight against her body. The dog cannot really fly, but can glide for long distances. To become air-borne she usually leaps from a high place, and is able to remain in flight for one Diameter for each 10 feet of initial height. Alternatively, the dog can take to the air for a short period (one Diameter) by running at speed with wings spread; make a stress roll of Strength + Athletics against an Ease Factor of 6 to check if she is successful.

The town of Hersfeld, in Central Germany (see *Guardians of the Forests*, page 86), has a prominent bell tower over which the townsfolk witnessed a dog flying in the summer of 1217. Even the monks of the nearby Benedictine Abbey, who attributed the sight to a miracle, recorded the event. Some members of the Hermetic order have proposed that the sighted creature was an animal Warped by magical springs that are known to be in the region, but an expedition in 1219 was unable to find evidence of the flying dog.

The flying dog is very skittish, and is afraid of both other animals and humans. She is still hiding near the town of Hersfeld, and survives by scavenging urban refuse. The dog was once a hunting dog and became transformed after finding herself caught near a magical explosion, although this actually occurred in a distant, mountainous area of Mythic Europe — from which she flew. A magus who finds the flying dog may become curious as to the source of the magical explosion and be able to retrace her flight path.

The weapon statistics for a mouse's bite are Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1.

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Muto in stomach.

**Appearance:** The mouse is small and unremarkable looking, but occasionally (perhaps once per day) the mouse belches a torrent of sparks, particularly when the mouse is nervous. This small fire (+1) is incapable of causing much damage, but it can ignite dry materials. The mouse is not immune to fire, so will normally try to flee any resulting conflagration. Belching sparks also draws attention to the mouse, and any character nearby spots him on a Perception + Awareness Roll against an Ease Factor of 9. A predator, like a cat, will be curious and surprised if a mouse she is stalking belches fire.

This family of mice ate the magical residue of a blast of Ignem magic cast by a Flambeau hoplite while dueling with a faerie knight. The now-monstrous mice, somewhat randomly breathe fiery sparks. The magus, distracted at the time, did not notice the col-

lateral effect of his magic as he hurtled off in pursuit of his faerie foe, but the mice have since burned down several nearby barns as they tried to nestle among the stored hay. The farmers who own the barns have not figured out what is happening; they suspect that an arsonist is the cause, and have set a watch on the remaining barns.

## *Training Creatures*

With the approval of the storyguide, any magical beast with an animal intellect — that is, those with Cunning (Cun) — may be tamed, and then used by another character as a mount, guardian, or companion as appropriate. Taming an animal is a possible laboratory activity for a magus, but mundane animal handlers and some magical characters can also attempt to tame animals. Once an animal has been tamed, it can be further trained and taught a number of tricks.

## *Taming Animals*

Regardless of whether the character taming an animal is a magus, a magical character, or a mundane trainer, taming is a seasonal activity and the character accumulates a number of points each season toward taming the animal. Taming is complete when the accumulated total of points exceeds the Might of the creature. Points only accumulate between consecutive seasons, so if the character does something else in the interim then any points already gained are lost. Points for taming animals can't be transferred between trainers.

#### **Required Points to Tame <sup>a</sup> Creature: Might of the Creature**

In all cases, the tamer must be able to interact daily with the creature throughout the season. If the creature has a violent temperament, the tamer may require some kind of protection (magical or otherwise).

If the tamer can generate enough points to tame a creature in a single season, he may split his point total between the taming of several creatures of the same species, but he cannot tame a number of additional creatures in excess of his Animal Handling Ability Score.

#### **A Hermetic Trainer**

For a magus, taming an animal is a laboratory activity, and the creature must be housed in the laboratory. Of course, if the creature is very large this may necessitate the construction of a new laboratory. The number of

## *Taming Mundane Beasts*

Mundane beasts can also be tamed, and (for this purpose only) mundane beasts have an effective (Animal) Might of 1 + 2 times Confidence Score. Note that taming a beast is a social activity, so penalties for the Gift apply to the number of points accumulated in a season; creatures with Magic Mights are often not affected by the Gift in this way. Some example mundane beasts are described in the Book of Mundane Beasts appendix, and *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* (page 38) describes a method of generating statistics for mundane beasts.

points that the magus accumulates each season is based on the magus' Rego (Form) Lab Total (including bonuses, see insert), which is calculated using the Hermetic Form appropriate to the creature — Aquam for a kelpie, Ignem for a fire elemental, and so on.

**Taming Points Accumulated Each Season by an Hermetic Tamer: Re(Fo) Lab Total – Creature's Might**

For example, to tame a fire elemental with an Ignem Might 25, the magus must accumulate 25 points. If the magus has a Rego Ignem Lab Total of 40 he will accumulate (40 – 25 =) 15 points each season, and therefore take two complete seasons to tame the elemental.

During the process of taming an animal, a Hermetic magus produces a Lab Text that has a level equal to the Might of the creature that was tamed. A magus may use such a Lab Text, written by himself or another, to provide a bonus to his Lab Total when training animals of the same Form (see below). In addition, a magus may spend a season replicating the instructions in such a Lab Text to tame another creature of exactly the same species, whose Might does not exceed the

![](_page_80_Picture_19.jpeg)

The following bonuses apply to the Rego (Form) Taming Lab Total for a Hermetic magus:

- Animal Handling Ability Score
- Experimentation Bonus (i.e. a magus can use the Experimentation rules when taming an animal; **ArM5** page 107).
- +1 for every 5 levels of the highest level similar Lab Text the magus consults as a guide. A similar Lab Text is an animal taming Lab Text using the same Hermetic Form.

#### **A Magical Trainer**

A character with the Minor Supernatural Virtue: Master of (Form) Creatures (see Chapter 4: Characters) may tame creatures of that Form that have Cunning statistics. For each consecutive season spent, the character accumulates a number of points equal to:

**Taming Points Accumulated Each Season by <sup>a</sup> Master of Creatures: Trainer's Might + Trainer's Animal Handling – Creature's Might**

If the trainer does not have a Might Score, his Magic Lore Ability Score is substituted for his Might in this calculation (a character with Might can also choose to substitute her Magic Lore Ability Score). If the beast is connected to the same Form as the trainer, the trainer's Might Score is doubled for the calculation above.

#### **A Mundane Trainer**

A mundane trainer can also attempt to tame a beast. He generates a number of points each consecutive season, equal to:

**Taming Points Accumulated Each Season by <sup>a</sup> Mundane Trainer: Int + Animal Handling – Creature's Might**

Generally, a mundane trainer will only be able to successfully tame beasts with a small Magic Might.

![](_page_80_Picture_32.jpeg)

## *Tricks, Stunts, and Tasks*

Once an animal is tamed it may be commanded by characters with Intelligence (Int) characteristics. The animal can be commanded by any such character with the Animal Handling Ability or by a character to whom the animal is loyal (see below). Regardless of the method used to the tame the animal, once tamed he does not count as being under a continuing mystical effect.

#### **Loyalty**

Once a creature is tamed he acquires the Personality Trait (Loyal +0), directed towards the character who tamed him. If the creature already has a Loyal Personality Trait, then he doesn't gain a new Trait, rather the old Trait is focused towards the trainer and its level doesn't change. Sometimes commanding an animal calls for a Loyalty Test, and as this is a "social interaction," penalties for the Gift do apply.

#### **Loyalty Test: Loyal Personality Trait + stress die vs Ease Factor**

If he wishes, any character with the Animal Handling Ability may spend additional seasons with an already-tamed creature to improve or transfer the loyalty of that creature. Each additional season of training increases the Loyal trait by +1, to a maximum of +3. A character can only improve the loyalty of an animal that is loyal to himself, but instead of increasing the Loyal trait, with this season of extra training the trainer can choose to transfer the animal's loyalty to another character (who must also be present for the season). The trainer may even transfer the loyalty of the animal to himself if he was not the character who originally tamed the animal. A magus who has the Lab Text for a tamed animal (see below) may also transfer or improve the Loyal trait of the animal by spending a season, as long as his Re(Fo) Lab Total is at least equal to level of the Lab Text.

#### **Training Abilities**

Any character with the Animal Handling Ability may train and therefore improve a tamed animal's Abilities using the standard training rules (**ArM5**, page 164). As normal, the master must have a greater score in the Ability than the animal does.

## *Realms of Power*

Usually, an animal may only be trained in Abilities that he already has a score in, as other Abilities are beyond his capacity.

## *Animal Ken*

A character with Animal Ken (**ArM5**, page 62) can speak to animals, including some magical beasts. Such a character can attempt to reason with any animal (regardless of whether it is tamed or not) using his Animal Handling Ability, and so convince it to perform a task. This does not result in a tamed animal, merely an animal that has decided to obey a particular instruction. Animal Ken offers no advantage during taming, but the character may issue more-complex commands to a tamed animal. The animal is no more likely to obey these commands, but it may allow the character to better utilize an animal as a scout or informant. Another important use of Animal Ken is to convince an animal that is balking at performing some dangerous task that the task is not dangerous after all.

But the troupe may relax this restriction on a case-by-case basis; for example, to allow a horse to be taught to swim. At the end of any season spent training for an Ability that the animal does not already have a score in, make a Loyalty test for the animal against an Ease Factor of 6. If this Loyalty test fails, then the animal does not gain any training experience and the season is wasted. Loyalty tests are not required to improve existing Abilities.

#### **Trained Groups**

A character may lead tamed animals in combat, as a trained group. The character must have either tamed each animal himself or spent at least a season working with each animal. The character's Animal Handling Ability score is used instead of his Leadership Ability score to determine how many animals he can lead at one time (see **ArM5**, page 172). Note that while the animals must all have Combat Scores that each fall within a 5-point range, the character leading them does not need to match the Combat Scores of the animals in this way (this is an exception to the normal rules). However, if the character's scores are outside the range, he does not count as part of the group when determining their combat totals. Depending upon the temperament of the animals involved, fighting as a group may require Loyalty tests against an Ease Factor of 6.

#### **Commanding a Creature**

In general, when the character commands a tamed creature make a Presence + Animal Handling roll against an Ease Factor set from the following table. The Ride Ability may be substituted for Animal Handling when the character is using the animal as a mount, and for exotic creatures another Ability might be more appropriate; the Magic Lore Ability might be used for commanding tamed elementals, for example. A botch may cause the animal to flee, mistakenly perform some other command, or attack its master — depending on the nature of both the command and the beast.

If several characters issue an animal with contradictory commands, it will preferentially obey commands issued by a character it is loyal to. Otherwise, it will obey the command of the character with the highest Presence + Animal Handling Total. For example, a magus tames a magical wolf (the wolf is now loyal to the magus) and he then commands the wolf to guard his sanctum door; the wolf will not normally obey contradictory commands to leave his post.

**Command Beast: Presence + Animal Handling (or Ride or Magic Lore) + stress die vs Ease Factor**

**Ease Factor:** Automatic success

The task uses an Ability that the creature has, and the creature has done this many times before.

**Ease Factor:** 6

The animal does not often do this task, and/or the situation is stressful for the animal.

**Ease Factor:** 9

The task is a complex series of sub-tasks, that requires the animal to concentrate for a long period of time — at least several rounds; or it is a new task that the creature has never performed before.

**Ease Factor:** 12

The creature fears some portion of the task. Note that it is the animal's perception of fear that is important here. Most animals would fear a battle, or fire, for example. If the creature does not have a Confidence Score, a Loyalty test against an Ease Factor of 6 must also be made to follow through on this task.

## *Chapter Six*

# *Magic Humans*

The realm of Magic can affect humans, or at least creatures with human form, just as easily as it can affect creatures of other shapes. Debate rages in the Order and among churchmen over whether these beings have souls, and on their fate after death. But since a number of them live at covenants, those magi who believe they have no souls have, on the whole, accepted the value of discretion.

This chapter covers four large groups of Magic Humans. First, the giants, who are far larger than normal humans. Second, the Spirit Votaries, who are humans who have accepted a link with, and power from, spirits. Third, the Magic Kin, including lineages of near-human creatures with a consistent touch of the Magic realm. Finally, humans who have come too close to the power of magic and have been transformed by it in some way, including the unquiet dead.

## *Magical Giants*

*Among [the giants] was one detestable monster, named Goëmagot, in stature twelve cubits, and of such prodigious strength that at one shake he pulled up an oak as if it had been a hazel wand. On a certain day, ... this giant with twenty more of his companions came in among the Britons, among whom he made a dreadful slaughter.*

— Geoffrey of Monmouth, *History of the Kings of Britain*

There are giants belonging to the Divine and Infernal Realms (the Nephilim; see *Realms of Power: Divine*, pages 16-17 and *Realms of Power: Infernal*, page 27), but the great majority of giants are either Magical or Faerie. (Faerie giants will be detailed in a future supplement for **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition.) Some so-called giants are merely humans with Giant Blood (see **ArM5**, page 43) and have no Might score at all; these cannot be said to belong to any Realm.

The typical giant resembles a large human, from Size +2 to about +6. Such giants may be found throughout Mythic Europe, tending to favor mountainous areas or craggy islands. They are especially prevalent in the British Isles. According to the historian Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1100 – 1154), giants were the original inhabitants of Britain before it was settled by humans from mainland Europe. Giants' bones can be found embedded in the rocks of many lands, and scholars in Mythic Europe generally believe these are the remains of giants who drowned in the Biblical deluge.

Some folk believe giants are the accursed descendants of Cain. Magi are more inclined to think they are the distant descendants of primeval giants, their size and Might diminished through generations of inter-breeding with humans. Or it's possible that some giants are an enchanted offshoot of the human race. Their ancestors could have been transformed by powerful Warping or subjected to some mighty, long-forgotten ritual.

## *Primeval Giants*

The primeval giants are immense creatures that appear in the mythologies of many cultures. They are usually considered to be the children of the Protogonoi (see Chapter 7: Magic Spirits, Primal Spirits), and ancestors of the Gods and Daimons. Theurgists rank these primeval giants as the kosmokrators and consider them to be spiritual entities, inasmuch as such vastly powerful creatures could be categorized at all.

In Greek mythology, the Titans are the children of the Protogonoi Ouranos and Ge. The six male Titans are all responsible for governing time in the Magic realm. Hyperion establishes day and night, Krios orders the heavenly constellations, Koios rules the axis of the heavens, Iapetos is the titan of mortality, Kronos rules all-devouring time, and Okeanos regulates the motion of the tides. Their wives control natural forces of the Magic realm: Theia is the brilliant sky, Eurybia is the mistress of the weather, Phoibe is the prophetic earth, Klymene is the underworld's cavern, Rhea is the fecundity of nature, and Tethys is the power of the waters under the earth.

Ymir was the Protogonos of the Norse lands, and the progenitor of two races of gigantic kosmokrators. The first brood were hideous deformed beings, inimical to man because of the wild elements they represented: Logi the devastating wild fire; Gymir the icy winds of winter; and Aegir the storm-lashed sea. The second brood was more peaceful and friendly towards man: Mimir the wise counselor of the gods; Urd the Weaver who represented time and fate; and their daughter Natt, the all-enshrouding night.

The Fomoire were the first inhabitants of Celtic lands. They were the children of Domnu, a chthonic titan of darkness and fertility. They include all-seeing Balor with his baleful eye, Indech the king, Cichol the Footless, prophetic Eithne, and the hideous ogress Lot.

Primeval giants should be created as kosmokrator spirits (see Chapter 7: Magic Spirits, Primal Spirits), since the rules for giants that follow do not cater to creatures who are the size of whole mountain ranges (or even larger — several myths claim that the world was created from the body of a slain primeval giant). These are among the mightiest of creatures in Mythic Europe, and are comparable with Archangels in their level of power.

![](_page_83_Picture_1.jpeg)

Giants appear occasionally in the medieval romances, such as Chrétien de Troyes' epic poems about the Knights of the Round Table. Giants in these tales are almost always brutish villains. Using the rules in this chapter, you can design similar opponents for the heroes of your own stories.

The giants in the romances usually dwell in castles: either abandoned ruins, or the former homes of their first victims. They proceed to rob and terrorize the surrounding countryside. Giants are portrayed in the romances as mighty opponents, often boasting of how many knights they have slain. They are boorish and cruel, in contrast to their chivalrous opponents.

Although the romances are not often clear about the giants' exact size, they cannot be very big as giants go. Sir Yvain was able to hit the giant Harpin of Mountain in the face with his sword, albeit while mounted. Thus, Harpin was probably Size +3 or less. In the romances, giants are invariably armed with clubs, and usually wear heavy furs for protection. They tend not to display any overt magical powers.

The example giant Barcas in this chapter is based on Ferragus, a giant who fought the hero Roland in one of the romances (*History of the Life of Charlemagne and Roland,*  also known as the pseudo-Turpin).

Magical giants usually make their dwellings far from the haunts of men. They avoid prolonged contact with the Dominion which is why, rural priests are fond of saying, they are less common today than they were in the pagan past. They usually take up residence in caves or ruined castles, but sometimes build huge houses instead. They may subsist by hunting and foraging, by raising livestock, by pillaging and banditry, or by some combination of the three. Some giants are solitary, but it is just as common for a group of giants to live together.

As a rule, giants are boorish, violent, and cruel. Both giants and giantesses are coarse in appearance and manner. They are almost always ugly and sometimes have prominent deformities. Male giants tend to be arrogant and boastful; their pride makes them easily provoked to violence. Many giants also display the vices of gluttony or drunkenness. They are dull witted, though they can display a certain low cunning. A rare few giants are peaceful or even gentle, but most are fierce and wicked.

Most giants are affected by the Forms of Corpus and Mentem. They usually have a limited repertoire of magical powers, often nothing more than their prodigious size.

## *Designing Giants*

Technically, any being of humanoid form, but larger than human size, could be considered a giant. This chapter is mainly concerned with gigantic beings who do not fall into any other category: human-like giants, as opposed to large elementals or the like. Giants get their enormous Size from the Gigantic Quality (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Major Magic Qualities).

#### **Concept**

Giants can be worthy combat adversaries for companions or magi with a martial bent. With a little imagination, one can think of other possible story roles for giants. For example, perhaps the characters need to build a bridge or other structure in a short time, and hit upon the idea of recruiting a giant to help as a laborer. A wise giant could be used by the storyguide as a source of ancient legends, a guide into a Magical regio, or a practitioner of rune magic (see *Ancient Magic,* pages 133-141).

Giants larger than Size +2 are unlikely to make good player characters − think carefully before using them as such. This is mainly because giants are very formidable in combat, making it difficult for the storyguide to design opponents powerful enough to challenge the giant, yet weak enough not to overwhelm the other player characters. In addition, the panicked response a 10-foottall giant would cause among mundanes could seriously sidetrack most sagas.

Most giants are affected by Corpus magic, but some are closely associated with one of the elemental Forms instead (most commonly, Terram).

Giants should be designed according to the rules for Magic Humans in Chapter 4. Note that giants have the Gigantic Quality, which will increase their Strength and reduce their Quickness. Apply the effects of that Quality *after* purchasing Characteristics.

Giants do not have any other compulsory Virtues or Flaws, but may choose any Virtues and Flaws they wish (except obviously contradictory Flaws like Small Frame or Dwarf) within the normal allowance for

## *How Big is a Giant?*

The following table gives approximate heights and weights for a figure of human proportions. It assumes that body density remains constant regardless of Size. Sizes below +1 are shown for comparison. The ranges of heights and weights are meant only as a guide. In **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition, a character's height and weight are determined by his Size Characteristic, not the other way round: a grog weighing 200 pounds cannot increase his Size to +1 simply by putting on 20 pounds of extra weight (unless, at the storyguide's discretion, the character actually becomes Obese). An especially tall and slender character might be a little taller than the normal range for his Size, or a heavyset one might weigh a bit more than the table suggests.

| Size H | eight       | Weight       |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| -2     | 2'9" - 3'9" | 22 - 46 lbs  |
| -1     | 3'9" - 4'9" | 46 - 100 lbs |

| 0   | 4'9" - 6'2"  | 100 - 215 lbs          |
|-----|--------------|------------------------|
| +1  | 6'2" - 8'    | 215 - 465 lbs          |
| +2  | 8' - 10'     | 465 - 1000 lbs         |
| +3  | 10' - 13'    | 1000 - 2150 lbs        |
| +4  | 13' - 17'    | 2150 - 4600 lbs        |
| +5  | 17' - 22'    | 2 1/2 - 5 tons         |
| +6  | 22' - 28'    | 5 - 10 tons            |
| +7  | 28' - 37'    | 10 - 23 tons           |
| +8  | 37' - 47'    | 23 - 50 tons           |
| +9  | 47' - 61'    | 50 - 107 tons          |
| +10 | 61' - 79'    | 107 - 230 tons         |
| +15 | 220' - 280'  | 5,000 - 10,800 tons    |
| +20 | 800' - 1000' | 230,000 - 500,000 tons |
|     |              |                        |

The most famous giant in Mythic Europe, Goliath of Gath (from the Bible), was nine and a half feet tall: Size +2. The Nephilim, described in *Realms of Power: Divine* as being 300 cubits (500 feet) tall, would be Size +18 and weigh about 60,000 tons.

**Virtues:** Greater Immunity, Ways of the (Land); Animal Ken, Wilderness Sense, Berserk, Puissant (Martial Ability), Reserves of Strength, Sharp Ears, Tough, Warrior. (Do not choose Giant Blood for a true giant; use the Gigantic Quality instead.)

**Flaws:** Major Personality Flaw (Avaricious, Compassionate, Greedy, or Proud, depending on story role), Fury, Greater Malediction, Outlaw, Wanderlust; Lesser Malediction, Afflicted Tongue, Feral Upbringing, Hunchback, Infamous, Poor Intelligence, Simple Minded, Weakness, Weak-Willed.

#### **Season and Abilities**

Giants may be designed as any Season. A Spring giant is physically immature and gets a penalty to Characteristics as if it were a child; see **ArM5**, page 29. (The storyguide should set the exact penalty.)

In most cases, giants should be able to speak at least one language and should take an appropriate Language Ability. This must be paid for using the experience points the giant gains for its Season; unlike human player characters, giants do not get a starting score in a language "for free." Giants must obey the usual restriction against starting with Academic, Arcane, or Martial Abilities unless they possess a Virtue that grants access to them. (Exception: the storyguide may wish to allow a giant to speak a dead language if appropriate to its background; for example, a giantess who has been trapped in a regio since ancient times might speak Latin as her native language.)

#### **Might and Qualities**

All giants must take the Major Quality, Gigantic; giants larger than Size +2 should take it more than once. The giant must be designed with a high enough Might score so it has sufficient Qualities to have the desired Size. (Taking Gigantic multiple times can be costly).

Other common Qualities for giants include Virtues that grant strength or toughness, improved combat statistics (especially Soak), and, occasionally, powers related to earth and stone.

#### **Finishing Touches**

The traditional weapons for giants in medieval tales are clubs or cudgels. Compute combat statistics as normal, keeping in mind

## *Giants in Combat*

The **Ars Magica Fifth Edition** combat rules are oriented toward characters of human size. Some special considerations apply to combat between humans and giants. As noted on page 192 of **ArM5**, a threepoint difference in size is approximately a tenfold difference in mass. This weight advantage gives giants an advantage in certain combat situations. For instance, it does not seem plausible that a 175-pound man should have an easy time grappling and pinning a 1750-pound giant!

The storyguide can simply rule that attempting to punch, grapple, or disarm a giant is completely ineffective. For a more complicated, but less arbitrary, approach, use the following rule of thumb: a giant gains a special defensive bonus equal to double the difference between its Size and a smaller opponent's. This can be applied to Defense rolls against scuffling and grappling, Defense rolls against being disarmed, and so on. This bonus does not apply against regular attacks with melee or missile weapons.

Giants of Size +4 or larger must bend over double in order to reach a Size 0 human with their hands. In such situations, giants usually prefer to kick, or use weapons.

This character guide is for a typical giant of the sort found throughout the British Isles. Such giants have been known to form alliances with hedge wizards or faeries.

This character guide has 205 Experience Points available to spend on Abilities, should the storyguide wish to complete it as a detailed character. Also, note that it carries only Inexpensive equipment, and so is eligible for either an armor or weapon upgrade, or the Poor Flaw (and three points of new Virtues to balance it).

Barcas considers himself an invincible wrestler and loudly proclaims his prowess to anyone who will listen. He loves a good fight and eagerly accepts a challenge from any warrior or wrestler. Barcas scorns weapons as things for "puny little people," but he doesn't object if his opponent wants to use them; he feels utterly secure that his magical power will protect him.

Barcas enjoys a nearly complete immunity to metal weapons. He has only one small vulnerable spot, just below the sternum. If an attacker knows this weakness and specifically concentrates his attacks on it, he suffers a –3 penalty to Attack but can inflict full normal damage, bypassing both Barcas's magical invulnerability and his Terram Resistance. Spells and non-metallic weapons can harm Barcas normally; his Terram Resistance gives him a Soak bonus against metal weapons that bypass his Magic Resistance.

## *Norse Giants and Trolls*

Norse mythology speaks of several races of giants spawned from the primordial giant Ymir, who aeons ago was slain by the gods and whose body was formed into the world. Ymir was so vast that a single eyebrow was used to form all of Midgard. The Norse name for giants is Jotunnar (singular, Jotunn). Myths speak of frost giants, mountain giants, sea giants, storm giants, and fire giants. The land of the giants is called Jotunheim, though the fire giants dwell in a different place, the fiery prison of Muspelheim. These domains might be places within the Magic Realm.

Unlike common giants, Norse giants are affiliated with the elemental Forms rather than the Form of Corpus (Terram for mountain giants, Aquam for frost or sea giants, and so on). Their minds are affected by Mentem.

All Norse giants have magical powers. Some possibilities include:

- Some Norse giants are full-fledged, non-Hermetic wizards. Rules for Norse rune magic appear in the forthcoming **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition supplement, *Hedge Magic*. Alternatively, the storyguide could give the giant-wizard an array of Qualities that grant spell-like powers.
- A few wise giants possess the powers of Divination and Augury (from *The Mysteries, Revised Edition*, pages 58-63).
- Frost giants have Greater Immunity to cold.

**Powers:**

*Invulnerability to Metal*, 0 points, Init n/a, Terram

Barcas cannot be harmed by metal weapons of any kind; they simply bounce off his skin. There is one weakness in this defense (see below).

ReTe 30 (Base 5, +2 Sun, +2 affect metal, +1 continuous effect): Lesser Power x2 (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

**Appearance:** Barcas stands about nine feet tall and weighs over 600 pounds. He has wild hair and a long, unkempt beard. His skin is flint colored and of a gravelly texture. He is rather good looking as giants go, being merely homely instead of hideously ugly. He wears crude garments of sheepskin and carries no weapons.

![](_page_85_Picture_59.jpeg)

- Fire giants have a Greater Immunity to fire.
- Sea giants can breathe underwater (a Lesser Power that operates continuously).
- Mountain giants have Terram Resistance (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Minor Magic Qualities ).
- Storm giants have Auram Resistance and a Lesser Immunity to lightning.
- Some Norse giants can change shape into other gigantic forms: use the Skinchanger or Shapeshifter Virtues to represent this power.
- A few Norse giants are able to change size. Design the giant according to its largest possible Size and give it a Lesser Power that allows it to shrink. When the giant reduces its size, its Strength diminishes by 2 and its Quickness improves by 1 for each point of Size reduction.

Norse myths speak of giants as big as mountains. Either these accounts have become exaggerated through generations of re-telling, or such colossal beings dwell permanently in the Magic Realm and are rarely seen by mortals. Most Jotunarr encountered in Mythic Europe range in Size from +2 to about +9.

Related to the Jotunarr is a race of Scandinavian **trolls**. The term "troll" is ambiguous and refers generically to a Magical or Faerie humanoid with supernatural powers. Scandinavian trolls resemble extremely ugly or misshapen giants. They are usually on the small side for giants (Size +2 to +4), and may have monstrous features such as claws or tusks.

#### **Rok, the Storm Giant**

## *Giants Story Seeds*

#### **A Cavernous Cage**

A giant named Morag has been driven from his home deep in the mountains by a group of diabolists. He has wandered into the area near the covenant and started practicing the traditional trade of his people: robbery. His first act has been to ambush and capture a local knight, whom he now holds hostage in a cave — the entrance is sealed with a boulder so heavy, even Morag needs a stout lever to dislodge it. If the characters simply slay the giant, they may never be able to free his captive. On the other hand, Morag craves revenge against the diabolists and could be persuaded to join forces with the characters to destroy them.

Use the Character Guide for " A Typical Giant" for Morag's stats.

#### **An Unquenchable Thirst**

Recently, some nearby humans stole one of Barcas's sheep, and after punishing the miscreants he discovered their wineskin and acquired a taste for alcohol. Now Barcas is robbing and pillaging his way toward civilization, guzzling wine and ale by the gallon wherever he uncovers it. Perhaps the covenant is caught in his path, or nearby mundanes ask the magi for help. If Barcas can be plied with enough ale and kept talking (that is, bragging), he will eventually let slip that he has one "insignificant" weakness. Alternately, Barcas can be humiliated into departing if a character manages to defeat him in a wrestling match.

#### **Stormy Seas**

The captain of a certain ship that plies the northern seas has formed a pact with Rok. The giant rides aboard the captain's ship (part of the hold is outfitted as his cabin) and summons up storms against rival merchantmen. In addition to handsomely lining the captain's pockets (and the giant's), their activities are starting to noticeably disrupt shipping. Since the culprits are constantly on the move, it would be difficult to trace the mysterious storms to their source. Especially if magi from different covenants and Tribunals jump to different conclusions about the cause. Once discovered, Rok can be defeated in battle or simply bought off with a hefty bribe.

*Axe:* Init –1, Attack +10\*, Defense +3\*, Damage +16

*Kick:* Init –3, Attack +4\*, Defense 0\*, Damage +13

\* *Add +2 to Attack and –2 to Defense when Rok is berserk*

**Soak:** +14 (+16 when berserk)

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1–9), –3 (10–18), –5 (19–28), Incapacitated (28-26), Dead (37+)

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Abilities:** Auram Resistance 4 (hail), Brawl 3 (kick), Concentration 3 (10) (controlling storms), Leadership 2 (intimidation), Magic Lore 4 (Norse giants), (Living Language) 3 (nautical terms), Old Norse 5 (incantations), Single Weapon 5 (axe and round shield), Survival 4 (cold climates), Thrown Weapon 1 (javelin)

#### **Powers:**

*Master of Fierce Winds,* 1–5 points, Init –7, Auram Rok can spontaneously conjure Rego Auram effects of fifth magnitude or less that create violent winds or hail. One of his favorite effects is *Charge of the Angry Winds* (**ArM5**, page 125).

(Focus Power)

*Gathering of the Stormy Might,* 2 points, Init –3, Auram.

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Group

As the spell on page 129 of **ArM5**. ReAu 40 (Base 5, +3 Sight, +2 Group,

+2 Size): Greater Power (40 levels, –2 Might cost)

*True Sight of the Air,* 0 points, Init n/a, Auram. R: Per, D: Sun, T: Vision

As the spell on page 127 of **ArM5**. This ability is continuously active.

InAu 20 (Base 1, +2 Sun, +4 Vision, +1 continuous effect): Personal Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost), Improved Powers (–1 Might cost, 10 xp Concentration)

**Equipment:** Axe, round shield, partial chain mail armor.

**Encumbrance:** 0

**Vis:** 6 Auram in hands

**Appearance:** Rok is a fierce-looking giant with long, flowing hair and a beard tousled by the small winds that constantly

![](_page_86_Picture_49.jpeg)

#### whirl about him. He stands about 15 feet tall. He dresses in the manner of the Northmen of bygone days, including — when prepared for battle — an iron helmet and mail byrnie.

Rok is something of a weakling among the storm giants, being one of the smaller members of that mighty and fearsome race. In battle, he uses his power over winds to create a *Charge of the Angry Winds* effect, to let him break up groups of opponents and hold enemies at bay until he can single out one victim to engage with his axe.

## *Non-Human Giants*

To design a oversized elemental, a spirit with a gigantic material form, or even a giant animal, use the rules for designing a creature of that type (from Chapter 8: Magic Things in the Elementals section, Chapter 7: Magic Spirits, or *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults,* respectively) and simply choose Gigantic as one of the creature's Qualities.

## *Spirit Votaries*

A spirit votary is a devoted worshiper of a magical spirit. In pre-Christian days, these individuals would be high priests and priestesses, and form a cult to venerate their spirits; similar powers could be found among a number of different cultures. Today, a spirit votary tends to be a solitary figure railing against the overt superiority of the Dominion of God.

#### **New Virtue: Spirit Votary**

*Free, Supernatural*

Taking this Virtue at character creation makes the character a Mythic Companion — a special type of character that takes the place of a player's magus character. This Virtue grants the Second Sight Virtue for free, and allows the character to have two points of Virtues for every point of Flaw (for more information on Mythic Companions, see Blood of Heroes in *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, page 103).

A Spirit Votary is required to take the Spiritual Pact Virtue (see below), along with

![](_page_87_Picture_11.jpeg)

#### **New Virtue: Spiritual Pact**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character has made a pact or agreement with a powerful Magical spirit, and in return for loyal service, is granted access to that spirit's power. The pact serves as an Arcane Connection to the character of indefinite duration, which the spirit can use to make itself aware of the current location and state of health of its servant.

The character can channel the power of the spirit by spending a Confidence Point. Make a Presence + Magic Lore + stress die roll: this is the amount of Magic Might Pool that the character acquires from his spiritual master. The Might points acquired are always less than the current Might points of the spirit, regardless of the roll's result. On a botch, the character loses all current Confidence points. This action is equivalent to spellcasting in with regard to the concentration it requires. The character can spend these Might points on any of the spirit's powers. Penetration is calculated in the usual way for magical creatures using the initial Might Pool in place of Magic Might, and including the character's Penetration Ability, if any.

The character using this power does not have a Might score, just a Might pool. He does not gain Magic Resistance from the use of this power, nor does he leave behind vis if he is slain. He cannot be affected by Vim spells (or similar magics) that target the Might score of supernatural creatures. Without a Might score, the pool does not replenish; once the character has spent all of his Might points this power ends. All powers used have their duration lapse when the character uses his last point of Might Pool. If this power is evoked again while the character still possesses Might Pool, then the new points gained replace the points left over; the two pools do not add. The points acquired by the character are lost from the spirit's Might pool and cannot be returned by the character, but the spirit regenerates the spent points as normal.

![](_page_87_Picture_17.jpeg)

While the connection to the spirit is active, there is some visual manifestation of this, which makes it clear that some supernatural effect is taking place. For example, if contacting a fertility spirit, fruits and grains might spring from around the character's footsteps. While in contact with a war spirit, a character might appear to be clothed in ghostly armor. When the character is actively channeling the spirit, he acts as an Arcane Connection to the spirit of indefinite duration, although this connection lapses when the Might Pool is exhausted.

The storyguide should decide upon the powers of the spirit. With the agreement of the troupe, this Virtue could be used to channel the power from a spirit of a different Supernatural Realm; or from a group of closely related spirits, such as a small pantheon of pagan "gods," but care should be taken not to grant the character too much flexibility with this one Virtue. A character can only have a single pact.

*Ruler of Plants*, variable points, Init – (Might cost + 1), Herbam.

\* Note that these powers belong to the spirit who grants her power. For details, see Chapter 4: Characters under Common Powers, and Chapter 7: Magic Spirits.

**Appearance:** Lise's life has been greatly extended by the Stasis power of her guardian spirit, however, this has left her appearance severely Warped; her body is a patchwork of different ages. While her face is that of a maiden, she has the body of a mature woman and the limbs of a crone. When invoking her power, her legs sprout roots that writhe into the ground, and there is a strong smell of damp soil.

Raised in the Old Ways by her grandmother deep in the woods, Lise was sixteen before she met another human. Once she discovered a village she visited it often, even falling in love with one of the serfs. Seeking marriage, she went to a priest to accept baptism, but rather than being taught her catechism she was badly treated by him instead. The priest told lies to Lise's lover, which resulted in his rejection of her. She fled from the village, vowing never to return. In the forest, her hatred for the priest (and by extension, the

## *Story Seed: Revenge*

Having amassed power and knowledge from her spiritual mentor, Lise is now ready to leave the regio that has both sheltered and Warped her, and pursue her goal to rid the world of the Church, one priest at a time. She is dangerously mad; her opinion of the entire Church is based on one unfortunate experience with a corrupt priest. Since her life has been extended due to the Stasis power of her mentor (see Chapter 8: Spirits, Common Powers), she cannot leave a Magic aura without aging dramatically. Her first task, therefore, is to spread the Magic aura of her genius loci to engulf the village; once the church is surrounded, she can then enter the village again and exact her revenge.

Church) festered. Remembering her grandmother's teaching, she searched out the holy place of the Dark Mother, a chthonic spirit of the deep forest and fertile earth who had good reason to resent the Church. Lise became the Dark Mother's only priestess. She has since dwelled within the spirit's Magical regio of 8, her life extended by the spirit's Stasis power, but she has been terribly Warped.

## *Magic Kin*

The power of Magic occasionally produces families of characters aligned with Magic who share many of the same essential qualities and magical powers. These are often called **magic kin**, which suggests that their powers run in their magical lineage. However, there are also magic kin who receive special abilities from beings who do not live and reproduce as humans do, and so must pass on their essential qualities some other way, such as through magical transformation or Mystery Cults.

Below are examples of ten different kinds of magic kin. Players can develop them into stories using the story hooks provided, or use these as character templates for either magic characters or characters aligned with Magic, if they wish. Each kin has several "Inherited Virtues" and "Common Flaws" that characters designed to belong to that family should strongly consider taking during character creation.

![](_page_88_Picture_36.jpeg)

## *Atlanteans*

Atlanteans are creatures of Magic who live in the deep ocean and have little or no contact with men. Occasionally, however, one is caught in the net of fishermen seeking deepsea herring, and brought to the surface world. Most Atlanteans have the form of fishes, and so do not survive for very long out of the water. But a few are capable of changing their form, and so can adapt to life out of water. Unfortunately, the insular Atlantean society does not tolerate the return those who have been "polluted" by contact with the surface world, and the returned Atlantean most often finds herself permanently exiled from her native home.

Some Hermetic scholars claim that Atlanteans are the descendants of the inhabitants of Atlantis who survived the drowning of their continent (hence their name), and who have since colonized the ocean floor, founding a kingdom of marine cities. Other scholars contend that Atlanteans are really creatures from the Magic Realm who are totally unconnected with the historical city of Atlantis. Some Merinita magi, who have studied the faeries of the sea, have concluded that stories of mermaids originated in garbled tales of Atlanteans told by sailors.

Atlantean characters may be generated with powers that utilize the special Range: Water-way, the special Duration: Storm, and the special Target: Body-of-water (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Virtues, Atlantean Magic).

#### **Atlantean Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Surface Form, Voice of the (Ocean), Greater Power: *Decree of the* 

*Atlantean,* Greater Power: *Murmur of the Deep.*

**Inherited Flaws:** Exiled Atlantean, Personality Flaw associated with her exile (for example Depressed).

**Decree of the Atlantean** 1 Point, Init: Qik+1, Animal R: Water-way, D: Conc, T: Ind

The character may summon a creature of water within the same water-way (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Virtues, Atlantean Magic), and order it to perform a task. Dolphins are particularly eager to please Atlanteans and always attempt to obey a summons, even at considerable risk to themselves. Other water creatures will only obey a summons if a Presence + Leadership roll against an Ease Factor of 6 + Creature Size is successfully made. The power must also Penetrate the Magic Resistance of a Magical creature to be effective. The character can attempt to summon either a specific individual, or a type of creature, in which case the closest of that type responds. Of course, if the water creature is distant it may take a considerable period of time for it to swim to the character's location.

ReAn 10 (Base 2, +3 Water-way, +1 Conc): Greater Power (10 levels, 30 levels of Penetration, +2 Init)

**Murmur of the Deep**

0 points, Init: Qik+1, Imaginem R: Water-way, D: Conc, T: Ind

The character can hear from the vantage of any point in the same Water-way (see Chapter 4: Characters, New and Modified Virtues, Atlantean Magic).

InIm 5 (Base 1, +3 Water-way, +1 Concentration): Greater Power (5 levels, –1 cost, 15 levels of Penetration, 15 xp in Concentration, +2 Init)

## *Story Seed: Woman from Atlantis*

Word is brought to the covenant of a noblewoman caught in the ocean by fishermen living in a nearby town. The woman is very surly and uncommunicative, although she does stridently proclaim that she is Pavania — a princess of Atlantis — and that simple fishermen are beneath her. Pavania is aware of The Gift, although she has not heard of the Order of Hermes, and if she learns of the magi's powers she will demand that they remove from her "the taint of the surface world." In return, Pavania says that she will guide the magi to her home, the sunken city of Atlantis, where they will be richly reward by her grateful father, the King of Atlantis.

Do the magi believe her? How do they remove "the taint of the surface world?" Even if Pavania is telling the truth, who (or what) is the King of Atlantis and what would he consider a "reward?"

#### **Men Born to Atlanteans**

Sometimes a child is born to an exiled Atlantean. Such a character can be represented by the Minor Supernatural Virtue: Magical Blood (see Chapter 4: Characters).

A few magi have studied the magic of exiled Atlanteans; a magus with this heritage has the Minor Hermetic Virtue: Atlantean Magic (see Chapter 4: Characters). One way this Virtue could be used in a saga is as the basis of a Hermetic Mystery Cult.

## *Flame Dancers*

Some people are born with magical fire in their blood, and this is especially true of those known as the Flame Dancers — men and women possessed by the power of fire. Some say they are inhabited by a flame spirit, others believe they have been taken by a fever or madness, and a few think that they are nothing more than hedonists who delight in passion and pleasure. Whatever the case, the Flame Dancers represent fire given life in a human body.

Flame Dancers generally love two things: fires and flesh. These are the mainstays of a Flame Dancer gathering, which

![](_page_89_Picture_41.jpeg)

## *Story Seed: Fuel for the Flames*

A scribe turns up at the covenant, offering to trade his skill at copying and illuminating books for room and board. He says he had to flee the church where he lately worked when it burned down. The man is unknowingly a Flame Dancer, who wants to overcome what he perceives as his baser nature, but his passions are aroused whenever he reads books that feature lewd or lascivious women. Certain passages of the Bible inflamed his desire, and as a result he accidentally set fire to the building. He will not admit this weakness if he can help it, since he sees it as a private punishment from God for his sins — but the magi can only safely hire his services so long as they ensure he does not read anything provocative, or else their own library might be in danger.

may be several congregating to celebrate an event, or a single Flame Dancer encouraging other people to enjoy themselves. They cannot resist a good bonfire once it's dark, and as soon as it gets going they generally feel compelled to dance around the flames. During this dance, they never tire. Flame Dancers sometimes have other compulsions, but whatever they may be, they always do them with flames; flames are part of their nature. If they must play music, they do so while a fire burns. If they must drink, they drink beside a crackling fireplace. If they are compelled to fight, they fight with fire. These activities are interconnected to them, so that they cannot do one without the other.

#### **Flame Dancer Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Greater Power: *Let the Bonfire Burn*, Personal Power: *Endurance of the Flame Dancer*

**Common Flaws:** Age Quickly, Compulsion (something to do with fire)

**Endurance of the Flame Dancer** 1 point, Init (Qik – 2), Corpus R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character feels as though he is unwounded and without fatigue until the sun rises or sets. (See *Endurance of the Berserkers*, **ArM5** page 134.)

CrIg 25 (base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Mom, +2 size): Greater Power (25 levels, –3 Might cost, +2 Might)

## *Forgotten Gods*

As the Dominion began to spread throughout Mythic Europe, many of the powerful beasts and spirits once worshiped as gods or feared as monsters began to retreat into Magic auras and the Magic Realm. Over time, many of them were forgotten, or their places taken by angels, faeries, and demons associated with the supernatural aspects of the world that had once been considered magical. They eventually ceased to exist at all in the mundane world. In the 13th century, a few of these Forgotten Gods may still remain hidden deep within the Magic Realm, sleeping away the ages until their time comes again.

Another way for the Forgotten Gods to survive within the waxing Divine realm is to take a living form — to become a human or animal or some other thing that can interact with the world. From within this new body, this magical force of nature can continue to influence the world as it once did, and experience life outside of the natural constraints imposed by Magic.

Many members of the Cult of Mercury believe that Mercere was the god Mercury reborn — though even among them there is disagreement as to his true nature: some think that Mercere was a man born with the blood of the gods, a sort of Mercurial demigod; while others believe he was an aspect of the god Mercury that took a human form. The former description matches the beliefs of the Cult of Heroes, while the latter suggests he was a Forgotten God. Of course, no one knows for sure which (or indeed if either) of these legends is true.

Forgotten Gods typically have some sort of focus — a type of magic or a part of the natural world over which they have influence. As characters, they should take a Greater Power that describes this influence. For example, if a goddess were associated with cats, she might have a power that would allow her to summon them or convince them to do her bidding.

#### **Forgotten God Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Focus Power (something associated with the character's magical influence, e.g. *Wizard's Communion*)

**Common Flaws:** Proud (Major) or Pagan (see Chapter 4: Characters)

**Wizard's Communion**

variable, Init (Qik – 5), Vim R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

As the spell on page 160 of **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition, the character can contribute 10 levels towards a spell cast with *Communion* by spending a Fatigue level.

MuVi General (base effect, +2 Voice): Focus Power (10 levels, +5 Penetration)

(Note that this is the version of the power to be taken as a Virtue; one taken as a Magic Quality would depend on the character's Might.)

## *Story Seed: No Gods Before Me*

While staying at a nearby monastery, the characters hear from one of the brothers the story of a new initiate who has lived in the penitent's cell for the last 30 days, and who seems to suffer from an unusual form of madness. According to the young man, he is Jove, the ancient god of the sky — or at least, he was. From what they have been able to make out amid his sobbing and violent outbursts, he was hungry and thirsty, and went to a church where he was offered Communion. He accepted it, and afterwards was stripped of all of his great powers. He feels he has been betrayed by the Divine, but also feels God's love and mercy for him. The monks think he has the potential to be a great holy man if he could only overcome his proud delusion that he is a god. If the characters go to him, they will find that this Forgotten God thinks he is telling the truth, and that he does have Magical powers, but that he also has True Faith. Will the characters get involved in his story?

When a famous figure in the Order of Hermes dies suddenly (Vinaria, the former Prima of House Merinita, for example), her body reverts to the form of a tree. In her will, she admits to being a Loamwalker and explains what this entailed. Her words imply that there are other Loamwalkers in the Order, as she warns the magi to mend their ways. The matter is brought to an emergency Tribunal to force these other tree-people hiding in their midst to reveal themselves. A trusted Redcap known to the characters — perhaps Ash, from *The Broken Covenant of Calebais* — admits to the characters that she is another of these trees in human form, and asks them to help shelter her from morepowerful magi who would use the threat of war to force her to reveal her secrets.

## *Loamwalkers*

The ancient power of trees is known to many who study the realm of Magic, and a common belief is that all the trees in a single forest are connected through a sort of magical group mind. In a sense this is true, since most trees are within voice range of each other; if they could talk, as they are thought to do in powerful areas of Magic, word would likely spread quickly among them. In Magic auras and in the Magic Realm, trees sometimes awaken as magical beings (see Chapter 8: Magic Things).

It is said that once every generation, one of these tree-spirits is born in a human shape or gains the power to adopt a human shape, and it becomes her duty act as a representative of the trees within the mundane world. These beings are called Loamwalkers. They use their powers to go forth into society to look after the interests of their forests. They are thus most common in parts of the world where there are large, sprawling forests and wild lands filled with trees, especially the lands of the Rhine and Novgorod Tribunals.

Being a Loamwalker is a great secret, and not something most of them believe is wise to share with others. Instead, they pretend to belong to other groups interested in nature, or join organizations that are open to anyone, guiding their members towards choices that serve their own interests. One such example is the group of Redcaps known as the Broken Branches, who are united in their love of nature and respect for the wild. Their founder was a Loamwalker who became a Redcap for the Order of Hermes, and so new Loamwalkers interested in magi often know to seek out that House.

Loamwalkers are typically shy and antisocial, and usually spend several years growing accustomed to humans before joining them. One method they have for doing this is to go to a place very near people, perhaps right on the edge of a village's fields, and change into a tree. In this form, they can then watch the humans and learn, until they feel ready to join their community. This can take many years.

#### **Loamwalker Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Personal Power: *From Hill to Hollow*, Personal Power (x2): *Stance of the Patient Tree,* or Personal Power (x2): *Stride of the Impatient Human*, Greater Power: *Walk Among the Ancients*

**Common Flaws:** Dark Secret (Loamwalker), Essential Flaw (minor): Antisocial (Presence), Fear (fire), Magical Bane (must be rooted into the earth)

**From Hill to Hollow** 0 points, Init (Qik – 2), Corpus R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

The character can move instantly from one tree to another, so long as the trees are within her sight and no further than 50 paces away.

ReCo(He) 15 (Base 15): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost)

**Stance of the Patient Tree** 1 point, Init (Qik – 4), Herbam R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character changes into a tree until the sun sets. (See **ArM5**, page 131)

MuCo(He) 35 (Base 25, +2 Sun): Personal Power x2 (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

**Stride of the Impatient Human** 0 points, Init (Qik – 1), Corpus R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character can see into the Herbam province of the Twilight Void, passing through a tree's vestige to lead others to another place, giving her a bonus to her Vestige Travel of +18.

InHe 35 (Base 25, +2 size): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

## *Lost Children*

Some children in Mythic Europe are born to families that cannot care for them, who cannot acknowledge them, or who simply do not want them. A common practice is for the parents to rid themselves of their offspring by leaving the children deep in the woods, far from civilization and their homes, so that they cannot find their way back. By and large this is very effective, for very few of them do. However, when these children are left in a Magic aura, sometimes they find their way into the Magic Realm or gain powers through other means. Then they cease to be merely human and become Magical, cunning children who no longer grow or change and who remain the same age forever.

A Lost Child typically appears to be between the ages of five and 15, and so to play one you should design a character with the Size and Characteristics penalties of a child (from page 29 of **Ars Magica**  Fifth Edition). Also, it may be appropriate to design the character with Cunning instead of Intelligence, if it is not intended as a player character.

## *Story Seed: Kidnapped!*

While traveling through a nearby wood, a player character attracts the notice of a Lost Child, though he does not know it. This adolescent falls in love with the character, and begins to follow the group closely. Being magical, the child is not interested in the niceties of courting or wooing, but instead engineers an abduction during the night, carrying off the character with whom she is infatuated. When the other characters awake, they realize they are missing one of their number and must follow the trail into the forest to recover their friend.

#### **Lost Child Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Ritual Power: *Seal the Wounds of Impetuous Youth*, Unaging

**Common Flaws:** Greater Malediction (does not grow out of the Size and Characteristic penalties of childhood), Social Handicap (acts like a child)

The character permanently heals a single Light wound.

CrCo 20 (Base 15, +1 Touch): Ritual Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost)

## *Men of the Lake*

Elementals are the non-sentient embodiment of pure elemental forces (see Chapter 8: Magic Things). In a few lakes scattered across Mythic Europe, however, sentient creatures are known to live that appear otherwise similar to water elementals. These creatures refer to themselves as the Men of the Lake, and they sometimes leave their watery homes, taking humanoid form, to journey in the surface world. The Men of the Lake are typically placid individuals and tend to travel alone. They claim that their journeys are merely scholarly endeavors to gain information about the surface world. It is unclear whether Men of the Lake are merely superficially similar to elementals, or are in fact elementals that have somehow acquired intellect.

The lakes in which the Men of the Lake live — which include Lake Balaton (near Bu-

## *Story Seed: Men or Machinations?*

One of the magi befriends a Man of the Lake whose special interest is also her own magical forte, and she slowly unravels the details of his society's organization. Once she learns of the "libraries" embodied by the winter Men of the Lake, she becomes driven to visit their nearby underwater regio. But she also wonders why the society of the Men of the Lake is constructed in this seemingly artificial manner — perhaps the Men of the Lake are not natural creatures but a magical creation of some type.

![](_page_92_Picture_12.jpeg)

dapest), Loch Dee (in Scotland), and Lake Constance (in Germany) — all contain magical regiones deep below the water's surface. It has been speculated that all the lakes are connected through a combination of underwater tunnels and magical portals. Magi have certainly observed that once a single Man of the Lake becomes aware of a particular fact, for example the construction of a covenant, then that knowledge rapidly spreads to his compatriots in other lakes across Mythic Europe. During the Schism War it is believed that some members of House Diedne used this network to rapidly travel across Mythic Europe, using it as an alternative Mercere Portal network (see *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, page 80). For this reason, most magi are suspicious of the Men of the Lake, and some even claim that the Men of the Lake are still sheltering Diedne refugees. For their part, the Men of the Lake are uninformative about both the existence of the lake network and their past relationship to House Diedne — if pressed, they claim to not understand Hermetic politics — and the Order of Hermes is unsure of the true extent of the powers of the Men of the Lake. Wise magi suggest caution, however, and cite an assault on Lake Balaton carried out by five magi of House Tremere, during the final years of the Schism War, as a warning. It is unclear what happened, but neither the Tremere nor their companions ever returned to the surface of the lake.

The society of the Men of the Lake is strictly divided upon seasonal lines. Spring characters live within the lake regiones, and seldom venture forth. As the character turns to summer he begins to make forays into the world, and as he becomes autumn he joins an ad hoc societas, dedicated to some particular interest, which he pursues with relish. For example, a societas might be dedicated to the study of trees, or of mountains, or of the city of Paris. As he turns to winter, the character returns to the lake regio. It is then unclear precisely what happens to a winter Man of the Lake — even Men of the Lake of other seasons are vague on the details. It seems, however, that winter Men of the Lake descend to a deep level of the lake regio, where they act like great, sentient libraries in their special interest, and also somehow maintain and police the network that connects the lake regiones. It is also possible that the winter Men of the Lake are eventually reborn as spring characters. The Order of Hermes is totally ignorant of how the society of the Men of the Lake is organized.

#### **Men of the Lake Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Greater Power: *Drown* (see page 137), Personal Power: *Simulacrum Form*, Ritual Power: *Command the Waters*, Focus Power: *Memory of Water*, (Lake) Regio Network.

**Inherited Flaws:** Infamous (Hermetic reputation)

#### **Simulacrum Form**

1 point, Init: Constant, Aquam R: Per, D: Constant, T: Ind

The character may take the physical form of anything that he touches — he reforms his body into a transparent, watery simulacrum of the target. As this is a constant effect, the character may freely transform his form without requiring activation of this power. However, it takes a round to effect a transformation, during which contact between the character and the target must be maintained. The simulacrum of the target is clearly made of water, will not be confused with the original target by even the most cursory of mundane inspections, and can also be distinguished from the original by Hermetic magic. The character can only take forms that are within 1 Size range of his native form — so, a size 0 character can take forms that range from size –1 to size +1. The change is mostly cosmetic, as the character only adopts the form of the target, he does not gain any abilities or powers, and his characteristics remain unchanged. However, if the target can walk or talk, the simulacrum may also do so — although he may only use languages that he already understands.

MuAq 20 (Base 5, +2 Sun, +1 Constant effect): Personal Power (20 levels, –1 cost)

#### **Command the Waters**

6 points, Init: Qik–16, Aquam R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

The character forms a volume of water he sees into a water elemental. This has the same effect as the spell *Rarefy the Crude Water* (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Elementals),

## *Story Seed: Ghostly Apprentice*

A magus looking for an apprentice hears tell of a child who lives at a distant abbey who frightens the horses and seems to have unnatural powers. When he investigates, he finds that the child does not have The Gift, but is something even more unusual — an Orphan Born.

## *Realms of Power*

but with Sight Range.

CrAq 40 (Base: 25, +3 Sight): Ritual Power (x2) (40 levels, –2 cost)

**Memory of Water**

2-5, Init: Qik–5, Aquam

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind.

The character receives a mental image of a fragment of the past of a volume of water that he touches. The fragment of the past has a length of Concentration, and it might include the locales that the water flowed through, if the volume is a river, or the people who entered a room, if the volume is contained in an amphora in the room. The point cost depends upon the chronological distance of the water's memories retrieved. A memory up to Diameter old has a cost of 2 Might Points, up to Sun old costs 3 Might Points, up to Moon old costs 4 Might Points, and a memory up to Year old costs 5 Might Points. Older memories are not accessible.

InAq 25 (Base: 3, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +4 Special Effect): Focus Power: (25 levels)

## *Orphan Born*

The Orphan Born are a strange phenomenon in Mythic Europe, and in fact many would say that they are impossible. They are engendered by parents of whom one or both are long dead, and born beyond the veil that separates the corporeal world from the spirit world. Thus the term "Orphan Born" — they are essentially orphans from the moment of conception. They are real humans, however, and are typically returned to the world of the living and taken to live where they will be cared for. Most are raised in monasteries or nunneries until they come of age, or other charitable institutions willing to take in children without living parents.

Orphan Born children typically manifest strange powers early on, such as the ability to see spirits and interact with them, or the power to vanish and reappear wherever they wish. As they get older they become almost transparent, so that they do not cast a shadow and they easily spook animals. In addition, the parents of Orphan Born children are rarely content to leave them be, and often interfere in their lives, though they may not remember why or what their relationship to the child is. Ghostly parents are very self-absorbed and often have difficulty even remembering that they have children. Like a Ghostly Warder, they may look after the character, but erratically, as they still have their own goals and desires.

#### **Orphan Born Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Greater Power: *Incorporeal Form*, Personal Power: *Ghostly/Physical Form*, Second Sight

**Common Flaws:** Magical Air, Magical (Ghostly) Companion, Monstrous Blood (spirit)

#### **Incorporeal Form**

1 point, Init (Qik – 4), Mentem

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind

The character becomes incorporeal, like a ghost, and is able to pass through solid objects and ignore physical damage.

MuCo(Me) 35 (base 30, +1 Conc): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

#### **Ghostly Form/Physical Form**

0 points, constant, Mentem

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character can interact with ghostly beings as if he were also ghostly, or corporeal beings as if he were corporeal.

ReMe(Co) 15 (base 3, +2 Sun, +1 constant, +1 requisite): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost)

## *People of the Clouds*

High above the clouds is a great sky-sea, a magic regio that connects the whole of the mundane world to the Magic Realm, where it is said that ships can float on air and sail between all the great cities of the world, unimpeded by the features of the land far below. These ships are navigated by sailors who have spent their entire lives on these flying ships. The magic of the air is in the blood, or so it is believed, and so the children of these magical sailors usually inherit their powers over the wind and sky, and also their insatiable wanderlust — a passion so strong that they cannot bear to stay in the same place longer than about a season.

The People of the Clouds are human, or at least human-like, though there might be other creatures with similar powers to theirs. According to their oral tradition, their ancestors were sailors caught in a great tempest at sea, which was such a powerful storm that it picked up their ship and hurled it through the air. They found themselves within a great black cloud, in which they could see nothing but each other, not even the ship, though the ship did not seem to have suffered any damage from the fall. For almost a year they sailed through that cloud, until one

![](_page_94_Picture_0.jpeg)

## *Story Seed: Sail Like the Wind*

At a time when the characters are in a hurry to get somewhere fast, they might encounter a ship's captain who offers to ferry them there in a quarter of the usual time for a very high price. If he has an inkling that the party includes a magus, he might ask for a magical device, for example. He is vague about the details, but promises that his ship can easily make the journey at this speed. He advises the characters to remain in their cabins for the duration of the trip, but any of them who peer outside to see the source of the powerful winds they hear will likely receive a shock as they realize they are soaring through the sky several leagues above the earth on a ship of the People of the Clouds.

morning they awoke to find they could see the sky again, and that their ship was floating motionless in the air far above the blue sea below. They soon discovered they had gained strange powers over the wind during their ordeal, and as a group they jumped overboard, as they knew the air would catch them. No sooner had they dived than the ship began to fall, but together they caught it and filled the sails with wind, and sailed on to their destination.

There are other powers this magical kin supposedly possesses, such as the power to harvest vis from the top of a cloud or to walk upon its surface like soft earth. It is said that the sailors with this ability often anchor their ships to the clouds, so that they do not fall while those of them steering the ship are resting and unable to concentrate. Characters in the Auram sphere of the Magic Realm might see such a ship far above them, hanging from clouds and swaying like a pendulum.

#### **Person of the Clouds Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Greater Power: *Sail the Wind* **Common Flaws:** Wanderlust

**Sail the Wind** 0 points, Init (Qik – 2), Auram R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

The character can cause winds powerful enough to lift him off of the ground and fly him through the air. If more than one character has this power, it is possible to lift and navigate a small boat, or even a ship if there are three or more.

Cr(Re)Au 30 (base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 highly unnatural, +1 requisite): Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +1 Init)

## *The Stoneskinned*

Many legends tell of men made of clay and earth who somehow became human, and statues of animals and people that have been brought to life at the will of the gods. Other stories tell of great giants made of stone and ice whose many descendants have taken human-sized forms. Perhaps these creatures have led to the magical race known as the Stoneskinned — men and animals who are so bound to the sphere of Terram that they become creatures of living rock, the equivalent of living statues that can bend and move at will.

The power of the Stoneskinned is typically tied to the character's age, so that they become more solid the older they grow. As children, only their fingernails and toenails are stone. As they develop and change, their skin becomes cool and dry, especially at their joints, and begins to develop a grayish dead color. By middle age, their skin has hardened to the heft and texture of stone, and they slowly lose all the hair on their heads and body. Their features become less distinctive, and after this stage, if they stand perfectly still, they can appear to be nothing more than an unusual outcropping of rock.

Such people as these are said to make excellent grogs for covenants located in mountain passes or rocky hills, as they are patient guards and difficult to injure, so long as they are not still outdoors at the break of dawn — because of their magical blood, the light of day turns them to unmoving stone pillars, though the effect is temporary.

#### **The Stoneskinned Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Personal Power: *Body of Stone*, Personal Power: *Skin of Stone*, Variable Powers (age or Might)

**Common Flaws:** Arthritis, Greater Malediction (turned to unmoving stone until the sun sets, if struck by natural sunlight), Nocturnal

**Body of Stone** 0 points, constant, Terram R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind The character gains improved brawling stats, which cannot deal non-lethal damage. These stats are Init +X, Atk +2X, Dfn +X, Dam +2X, where X is either the character's (Might Score / 5) or his (age / 10).

MuCo(Te) 15 (base 3, +2 Sun, +1 constant, +1 requisite): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost, Variable Powers)

**Skin of Stone** 0 points, constant, Terram R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The character becomes more resistant to damage, gaining a +1 bonus to Soak and a –1 to Initiative for each 10 years of his age or magnitude of his Might Score.

MuCo 15 (base 4, +2 Sun, +1 constant): Personal Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost, Variable Powers)

## *Warders of Mystery*

This sort of magic kin is more of a society, one that adopts anyone with a demonstrated interest in history. Ceremonially, they call themselves the Warders of Mystery, though as individuals they are Auditores, or "hearers," a title that is said to date back to before the fall of Rome. Their symbol is a pot and a nail, each separate from the other: the pot represents the vessel of the Magic Realm and the mysteries it contains; and the nail represents history, with its sharp point that affixes objects in place.

## *Story Seed: The Standing Stone*

While passing through a village in the mountains, the characters learn that the inhabitants were attacked during the previous night by a group of wild-looking bandits, strong and stalwart men who turned every sword and arrow with which they were struck, though they fled when dawn approached. The villagers managed to capture one of the youngest with a hunter's snare as they were leaving. Yet now the ropes with which they bound him are tied to a large rock in the clearing where they were holding him, and there is no sign of the boy. Perhaps the characters can solve the mystery of what happened to their prisoner and either defeat the Stoneskinned bandits or recruit them to serve their covenant.

![](_page_94_Picture_28.jpeg)

![](_page_95_Picture_1.jpeg)

The Auditores believe that magic is diminished as knowledge of it spreads, that part of what makes Magic powerful is its inherent mystery. They see it as their duty to ensure that magic is kept secret, and that those beings who wield magic remain hidden from society at large. According to them, public displays of magic are crimes against nature.

The Warders of Mystery is said to have its origins in magical scribes and scholars of the classical world, historians who first learned about the realm of Magic and who began to chronicle magical events for posterity. In so doing, they found that what they described ceased to be magical at all. They were joined by pilgrims and diplomats, those who sought to discover what it was they must protect, and who negotiated with magic creatures to help limit the damage they caused to Magic as a whole. Some Auditores have a strong sense of morality and a desire to see justice done, and have made it their personal mission to punish those who abuse the power of magic, and set right what they have done wrong.

#### **Warder of Mystery Stats**

**Inherited Virtues:** Greater Power: *Perceive the Distant Truths*

**Common Flaws:** Meddler

## *Story Seed: Stolen Glory*

After a particularly fantastic event in which the characters used their magic to solve a problem, a catchy song begins to spread through the region attributing the success to a local nobleman instead of the characters. It might still describe them, but in lesser roles such as diviners and advisors to the lord. Other events are confused or even completely wrong, and all supernatural elements are simply attributed to either God's will or the work of the Devil. This is an attempt by one of the Warders of Mystery to limit the damage he believes the characters have done to the realm of Magic, as they may learn when they investigate who is trying to usurp their glory.

![](_page_95_Picture_11.jpeg)

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Room

The character can see and hear what transpires at any place to which he has an Arcane Connection, perceiving images and events from the perspective of the target.

InIm 30 (base 3, +4 Arc, +1 Conc, +2 Room): Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +5 xp Penetration)

## *Transformed Humans*

Sometimes, humans are Transformed by magic and become part of the Magic Realm. They lose their humanity in the process.

It is possible, though by no means common, for a living magus to become a being of Magic. Sometimes, this is the culmination of a lifetime's quest for mystic lore. Other times, it happens by accident.

## *Drowned Men*

Sometimes when a sailor drowns at sea his body passes into a magical regio and is eventually returned to the world of living — perhaps washing up on a foreign shore unconscious but alive. It is unclear whether these sailors have actually drowned and then undergone some kind of resurrection, or whether they were rescued at the very last moment prior to drowning by some magical force. In either case, Drowned Men are irreparably changed by the experience and are now creatures of magic.

#### **Drowned Men Characters**

Drowned Men must take the Major Supernatural Virtue: Transformed (Being) (see Chapter 4: Characters). Often, Drowned Men develop personality Flaws associated with the sea (Obsession, Fear, Compulsion, or Vow, for example), but this is not compulsory. They also usually have the Major Supernatural Virtue: Greater Immunity (drowning) (see **ArM5**, page 43) and the Major Story Flaw: Servant of the Ocean (see Chapter 4: Characters).

A character drowning at sea is *very* unlikely to be returned to the world of the living, but characters can improve their chances of becoming Drowned Men, rather than merely dead men. This is a complex task, however, that requires a significant period of time, and so cannot normally be completed while the character is actually in the process of drowning. The first step is for the character to contact a magical water entity of significant Might (greater than Magical Might 35 (Aquam)). The second step is to negotiate with the magical creature; typically, the creature will require a quest to be completed or the payment of a treasure. Thirdly, the character must surrender himself to the water, trusting that the magical creature will return him to the world of the living.

In order to contact a powerful magical water creature, the characters needs to attract the creature's attention. This can be accomplished by making an offering at a particular time and place, by casting a spectacular, high-magnitude spell within the creature's habitat, or perhaps by negotiating an introduction via a lesser creature, among other ways. To determine whether a character knows how to contact a suitable creature, an Intelligence + Magic Lore Roll is made against an Ease Factor of 12.

#### **Determine Contact Method: Int + Magic Lore + Stress die vs Ease Factor of 12**

Once he has contacted a suitable water entity, the character must negotiate and convince the creature that it should grant him power — almost all powerful water creatures have the ability to save a man from drowning should they choose to do so, and those few that do not can arrange for other creatures to perform the rescue, if they so desire. Ideally, the negotiation between the character and the creature should be roleplayed, but the troupe may abstract it by making an Intelligence + Bargain Roll for the character, against an Ease Factor of 6 + (the creature's Might) / 5. Magic creatures normally have no inherent reason to offer power, and so in return may require that the character perform a task. For example, preventing fishermen from depleting the creature's lake, slaying a rival creature, or recovering a stolen possession from a remote isle. Alternatively, the creature could request a reciprocal sacrifice of power — represented by the character adopting a Flaw. The creature's attitude to negotiation is, of course, influenced — positively, or negatively — by the method used to contact it.

## *Story Seed: The Lighthouse Keeper*

The island of Geita stands among a small archipelago of sharp rocks at the head of the Vilnes Fjord. Over the centuries, during violent storms many ships would have been dashed and wrecked against the raw outcrops of the island, if not for a lighthouse built on the island. The reclusive lighthouse keeper is reputed to have lived on the island for several centuries and, for curious magi, he could be a valuable source of knowledge about the local area.

The lighthouse keeper is named Thorstar, and his father was a Viking chieftain. In 912 Thorstar's father — frustrated by a particularly galling series of losses of boats, men, and loot — built a house on the island and stationed Thorstar there. Thorstar was tasked with ensuring that a fire always burned on the island to ward boats away from the rocks. For many months he diligently completed his task, but one night he left the island to spend the night with his lover on the shore. That night, a violent storm swept along the fjord, the fire went out, and Thorstar's father's boat — heavily laden with loot from raids on monasteries — struck the island and sunk, killing all aboard.

Distraught, Thorstar threw himself from the island, intending to smash himself on the rocks, but an enormous magic fish saved him. The fish lived in a magic regio beneath the island, and was sick of being pestered by the ghosts of drowned sailors. So the fish compelled Thorstar to complete the task set by his father, to continue maintaining the lighthouse, and in return the fish restored both him and his father to life. Thorstar's father returned to raiding — until he was killed by a rival in an argument over a woman — but Thorstar remains to this day on the island, tending the lighthouse as he promised the fish.

#### **Negotiation for Power: Int + Bargain + Stress Die vs Ease Factor of 6 + Might / 5**

After a successful negotiation, the final step is for the character to drown himself — trusting in his agreement with the sea creature. The creature is unlikely to be fooled, and may be violently insulted, by a character who enacts "drowning" while under the influence of protective magic (for example, *Lungs of the Fish*; **ArM5**, page 122). If the creature saves the character, then he is transformed and acquires the Major Supernatural Virtue: Transformed (Being). The drowning and rescue of the character could conceivably precede the completion of the task set by the creature. This will depend upon exactly what was negotiated between the magus and the creature.

#### **Burned and Buried Men**

A person may also be saved from immolation (by a magical creature of Ignem), or from burial (by a magical creature of Terram), and so acquire similar Virtues to a Drowned Man. There are fewer recorded incidences of this occurring — perhaps merely because many more men drown than are burned or buried alive. Hermetic scholars also speculate that it is possible to be saved from death by entities that represent other Forms, although no examples have yet been found.

## *Revenants, the Walking Dead*

*It was not long before men became aware that Glam was not easy in his grave. Many men suffered severe injuries; some who saw him were struck senseless and some lost their wits. Soon ... men began to think they saw him about their houses. The panic was great and many left the neighborhood. Next he began to ride on the housetops by night, and nearly broke them to pieces. Almost night and day he walked, and people would scarcely venture up the valley, however pressing their business. The district was in a grievous condition.*

#### *— The Saga of Grettir the Strong*

While ghosts are the disembodied spirits of the dead, medieval stories also tell of restless dead who still occupy their material bodies. These are **revenants** or "the walking dead," which differ from ghosts in that their only form is an animate, material corpse.

Although a revenant is bound to a physical body, its animating force is a spirit. Some magi consider them to be a special sub-class of ghosts (see Chapter 7: Spirits, Ghosts). Like ghosts, Magical revenants are connected to the living world through some overwhelming personal need. Their motivations and personalities are as varied as those of ghosts.

The physical statistics of a revenant are also usable for corpses that have been

## *Option: Resistance to Piercing Weapons*

Piercing weapons such as spears and arrows are effective against living beings, but potentially less so against the walking dead. Such weapons are unlikely to break bones or hack off limbs. The troupe may wish to grant revenants an additional +10 Soak bonus against such weapons, or simply rule them totally ineffective.

**Ars Magica** Fifth Edition does not formally differentiate weapons into categories such as "piercing," so if the troupe adopts this option, they will sometimes have to exercise judgment about whether a weapon counts as a piercing weapon.

animated by spells such as *The Walking Corpse* (**ArM5**, page 135). Such automatons are not supernatural beings and have no Might score (and hence no Magic Resistance).

#### **Designing Revenants**

Walking dead usually lose most of their living memories, including loss of Abilities.

## *Realms of Power*

Therefore, most of them are Spring or Summer characters. They tend to keep Abilities related to their mortal ties. They should be designed according to the rules for Magic Humans in Chapter 4: Magic Characters.

Revenants are tireless and inexorable opponents. They are immune to fatigue and pain; having no need for blood or vital organs, they can ignore wounds that would be fatal to a living person. The No Fatigue and Improved Soak Qualities (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Qualities and Inferiorities) represent this supernatural resilience. In addition, some revenants are stronger than living men.

When the walking dead resort to violence, they usually rely on unarmed attacks, but they can use weapons and armor if the storyguide wants to make them more dangerous.

#### **Fighting the Walking Dead**

Magic can affect either a revenant's body (through the Form of Corpus) or the animating spirit (usually through Mentem or Vim). Destruction of the body does not harm the spirit, though the spirit may lack any power to affect the physical world once its body is destroyed.

*Lay to Rest the Haunting Spirit* can affect the animating spirit, provided the spirit is subject to the Form of Mentem. Magic can force the spirit out of the body, and if this happens (or if the body is destroyed) the spirit cannot reenter the corpse or possess a new one unless it has specific powers allowing it to do so.

Revenants are difficult to harm with weapons. In particular, they cannot be Incapacitated; treat Incapacitating wounds as Heavy wounds instead.

Perdo Corpus spells designed to target the living often have no effect on revenants, as their bodies are already dead. Spells that specifically break bones or destroy limbs do not hinder the them as much as they do living people, but may cause Wound Penalties at the storyguide's discretion. For example, a broken leg might affect a revenant as if it were a Light wound. Perdo Corpus spells can, of course, be designed specifically to target the unquiet dead.

Different legends speak of special methods by which heroes can destroy the walking dead. In certain Icelandic sagas, a *draug*  (revenant) could be destroyed by cutting off its head and placing it between its thighs. In a tale from Yorkshire, revenants could be destroyed by driving stakes through their hearts. A character who knows the correct method should make a regular melee attack. If the attack would have caused an Incapacitating or fatal wound before taking into account the revenant's Improved Soak Quality, and if the attack was with the correct weapon (for instance, a wooden stake if that is the way to destroy this particular revenant), then the revenant's animating spirit is destroyed and any vis in the corpse is left behind. Learning the method for destroying a revenant may require a story, or if the storyguide prefers she can assign it an Ease Factor of 9 on an Intelligence + Magic Lore roll.

Medieval tales and illustrations depict both corpse-like walking dead and animated skeletons. The word "zombie" is of New World (Haitian) origin and would not be used by characters in Mythic Europe.

#### **Animating Corpses with Magic**

Wizards can animate corpses using Rego Corpus spells (or certain non-Hermetic powers). Such corpses use the same statistics as a revenant, with the following changes:

It has the No Fatigue and Improved Soak Qualities listed in the character guide, but no other Qualities, Virtues, or powers of its own.

A corpse animated by a spell has no Might score or Confidence score. Its Brawl skill is nominally 3, though as an optional rule the troupe may wish to assign a Brawl

score equal to the caster's Finesse.

A corpse animated by demonic possession or a Magic spirit's Manifestation power has a Might score equal to the cost of that power. It uses the possessing spirit's Confidence score, if any. The controlling spirit may be able to use its powers through the possessed corpse (depending on the description of the possessing power).

*Realms of Power: The Infernal* includes rules for demons who can animate corpses on page 75.

Regardless of how the corpse is animated, its unarmed attacks can be blocked by Magic Resistance.

## *Daimons and Heroes*

Legends speak of human wizards who have unlocked the secret of immortality and achieved ascendency to the Hall of Heroes, becoming Daimons of the Magic Realm (see Chapter 7: Spirits). The process of becoming an immortal spirit is called apotheosis. It is the ultimate goal of several mystery cults. The mystical groups that pursue apotheosis, along with rules for the transformation itself, are detailed in *The Mysteries: Revised Edition*  (pages 82-86).

## *Living Ghosts*

Theurgists claim that is should be possible for a human wizard to magically bind her own spirit to a physical location, becoming something like a ghost but retaining her human will (and her magical powers). Rumors speak of mystery cults dedicated to the pursuit of this very secret. See *The Mysteries: Revised Edition* (pages 70-74) for details.

A human skeleton weighs much less than a living person, so an animate skeleton's Size is –2.

## *Magi in Final Twilight*

Magi who enter Final Twilight usually vanish from the world and are never heard from again. In some cases, however, they might be transformed by mysterious forces into something altogether inhuman. Bjornaer magi, for example, permanently assume the forms of their heartbeasts, and may become magical Great Beasts (see *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*, page 24). Unsubstantiated rumors within the Order speak of powerful magi from beyond Twilight contacting the living through dreams or visions.

On rare occasions and at the storyguide's discretion, a magus who enters Final Twilight may transform into a Magical creature or spirit. Such a magus literally becomes a Magical being with a Might score, but loses the ability to work Hermetic magic. The transformation may be tied to the magus' magical specialties: his Hermetic Virtues (and Flaws) or favored Arts. For instance, a magus with a Magical Focus in storms might, under the right mystical circumstances, enter Final Twilight and become an elemental spirit of air.

The Might Score of a magus Transformed by Twilight should generally be around 20 to 40. Depending on the nature of the transformation, it may be appropriate to set the Might score equal to (5 x relevant Ability score) or (relevant Art score). For example, Bjornaer Great Beasts have a Might score equal to (5 x Heartbeast). Exactly which Art or Ability is relevant should be decided based on the specific transformation.

## *Chapter Seven*

# *Magic Spirits*

Spirits make up an important part of the magical world, both as natives of the Magic Realm and as the unseen inhabitants of the earth. However, because spirits are by their nature insensible to most physical beings, and have a limited ability to interact with them anyway, they are largely ignored by the inhabitants of Mythic Europe, magi included. Of those few Hermetic magi whose interest lies with the spiritual world, many are descendants of Ancient Greek traditions, and so much of the common terminology of the spirits is derived from the Greek language. However, magi and wizards alike from all over Mythic Europe are aware of the Invisible World, and use their magic to placate, coerce, and exploit the spirits.

## *Spirits as Characters*

The body of a spirit is pure form, and involves no matter. Without the exercise of its supernatural powers, a spirit cannot affect matter in any way; and without magical assistance, a material being cannot sense or interact with a spirit either. Spirits ignore the restrictions of the physical world, such as sources of damage and deprivation, and are not constrained to walk upon the surface of the world, but can fly through the air or solid objects with equal ease. Further, they are truly immortal, and do not suffer the perils of aging or disease.

Lacking a physical existence, a spirit also lacks the features of informed matter, such as color, weight, and size, and therefore produces no sensory species (**ArM5**, page 75). When magic is used to sense the presence of a spirit (this includes the Supernatural Ability of Second Sight), the viewer's imagination supplies details for the incomprehensible species supplied by the magic, and so a spirit may be perceived by such characters in very different ways. As visual creatures, humans usually "see" spirits under the influence of such magic, but those with no capacity to see are not barred from sensing spirits, if they have the appropriate magic. For want of a better term, a spirit's communication with physical beings is called Silent Speech, for such impulses are usually received as auditory species, but it could be interpreted as smells or feelings on the skin, and still be understood with no difficulty.

**Inherited Virtue**: Magic Spirit

#### **Concept**

Like other creatures, spirits have scores in the eight Characteristics, and these should be determined like other characters. A human-shaped spirit has the Characteristics of a human, an animal spirit has the Characteristics of an animal, and so forth. For plants and spirits of non-living objects, assume that all Characteristics begin at zero and apply 7 characteristic points in the usual fashion. Note that the physical Characteristics of spirits are only used when interacting with other incorporeal creatures; spirits must possess the *Donning the Corporeal Veil* Power to interact with material beings.

A spirit occupies no physical space and has no weight; therefore Size is meaningless. Those who are able to sense a spirit perceive it in its natural form, which may be of any apparent size (although those with a high Presence often appear bigger than those with a low score in this Characteristic). A spirit that adopts a physical form acquires a Size along with its Physical Characteristics (see the *Donning the Corporeal Veil* Power, below).

As noted in the Characters chapter, all spirits have the Magical Air Flaw. In their native form they can sense other spirits without needing the Second Sight Virtue.

## *Taxonomy of the Invisible World*

The word **spirit** (from the Latin *spiritus*, meaning "breath") is a general term used to describe a being with no material existence. However, the term confuses two quite distinct phenomena. There are the spirits that were created as such, and the spirits that were created as human but have since ceased to be material beings. To distinguish these two, the word **genius** (pronounced "GAIN-ee-oos" to distinguish this Latin word from the English word) is used for the former kind, and **animus** for the latter. In this book, when we refer to "spirits," we include both genii and animi in this category; however, where a rule pertains to just one of these beings, we will use the appropriate term.

The genii technically include all things that never had a physical existence; but angels and demons are usually considered separate from genii. Some genii exist in the sublunar regions (the demons and the genii proper), and some in the Heavens (the angels). The genii who dwell in the Magic Realm itself are powerful beings called **Daimons**, or Named Spirits; whereas those spirits on earth are of much lesser power and are called **Airy Spirits**.

#### **Season and Abilities**

Simple spirits of material things such as plants or elements are often Spring characters, as are ghosts who have not yet come to terms with their death. Spirits of more complex concepts and most of the self-aware ghosts are Summer characters. A Daimon is never a Spring character, and often of the Autumn or Winter season. The Theoi — those spirits who were worshiped as gods — are usually Winter characters.

Spirits have little need for Abilities pertaining to physical actions, and rarely have the option to learn Academic or Arcane Abilities, so they often have the Reduced Abilities Inferiority. Spirits that have the ability to take material form can use any Abilities they possess in that form.

#### **Might and Qualities**

The typical Might scores of different types of spirits are listed in the sections below. Most categories of spirits have a wide range of Might scores, and so can play potentially any role in a saga.

The incorporeal, immortal, and tireless form of a spirit does not need to be purchased as a Magical Quality. Spirits have no capacity to be seen by normal humans without buying a Power such as *Eidolon*, and they cannot influence the material world without Powers such as *Ghost Touch* or *Donning the Corporeal Veil*. Magical Qualities such as these are almost essential for player character spirits. It is not unusual for the majority of a spirit's Qualities to be spent on Powers.

## *Powers of the Spirits*

Spirits typically have one to five supernatural powers, and this section details many of the most common ones. General guidelines for powers can be found in Chapter 4: Magic Characters. Some of these powers are similar to those available to the Forest Spirits in *Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal*. The details given here revise and update those descriptions. These powers may also be used for creatures other than spirits. Naturally, any power that affects another being must penetrate its Magic Resistance. Powers that are similar to Ritual spells permanently reduce the spirit's Might score as well as Might pool; Might Score can be restored according to the mechanism detailed in Chapter 4: Magic Characters.

#### **Control Human**

2 points, Init equal to Qik, Mentem R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

If this power penetrates, the spirit exerts direct control over the target. It can issue commands that the target carries out to the best of his abilities; however, the target can attempt to break the control of the spirit ev-

## *Spirits as a Source of Vis*

The intangible bodies of spirits contain raw vis, typically 1 pawn of an appropriate Form per magnitude of their Might, although spirits with a Might less than 5 do not have sufficient power to represent even a single pawn. If the spirit is slain while in immaterial form, the vis may be automatically distilled into a physical receptacle; this usually only occurs if the spirit has a strong tie to the material world, such as a ghost, a spirit of the elements, or a genius loci. Many spirits do not have such ties, however, and upon their death the vis remains in non-material form, and must be converted to physical form (using a variant of *Gather the Essence of*  *the Beast*) for it to be used by a physical being. If an Aspect of a Daimon is destroyed, it can choose whether or not to recall the immaterial body; only if the body remains does the vis remain. Use of magic that destroys the Might of a spirit also reduces the amount of vis accordingly, so a spirit totally destroyed in this manner leaves no vis behind at all.

The power *Donning the Corporeal Veil* (see below) creates a physical body, which if slain contains normal material vis. The *Presence* Power (see below) results in vis accumulating in the spirit's habitual haunt, and harvesting this vis does not harm the spirit (although it might annoy it).

ery time he is asked to do something complex (something that would involve the use of an Ability, spell, or magical power), dangerous, or which goes contrary to the target's nature. To break free, the target makes an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor equal to 9 + magnitude of spirit's Might. This Intelligence roll is modified by any appropriate Personality Trait of the target. For example, a character ordered to fight is penalized by his Aggressive Personality trait, but might be aided by his Cowardly Personality Trait. Where multiple traits might apply, use the one that gives the largest modifier, whether positive or negative. If the Intelligence roll fails, the target must obey the spirit but re-

![](_page_100_Picture_17.jpeg)

ceives a +1 cumulative bonus to his next attempt to break the spirit's control.

ReMe 30 (base 20, +1 Touch, +1 Conc): Greater Power (30 levels, –1 Might cost, +3 Init)

#### **Donning the Corporeal Veil**

5 points, Init equal to Qik – 3, appropriate Form (Lesser Power) OR

0 points, Init equal to Qik – 1, appropriate Form (Greater Power)

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Produces and animates a body of flesh, wood, or elemental matter. A spirit with this power has a single corporeal form that it can adopt; although some spirits have this power more than once, and can therefore form more than one physical shape, such spirits can still only use one body at a time. The body created with this power has the same physical statistics as the spirit, but can have a maximum Size of +1. Creating a larger body requires an additional magnitude for every additional 3 points of Size, and thus requires that another Greater or Lesser Power Magical Quality is bought to account for the additional levels.

A spirit may maintain the body indefinitely, recreating it every time the duration expires, but it is subject to aging, disease, and deprivation (but not fatigue) just like a living being. The body lasts until slain or dissolved by the spirit. If slain in material form, the spirit (or Aspect) is also destroyed, and the body will contain pawns of vis equal to that within the spirit's spiritual form. A spirit whose body is sorely injured usually dissolves it to prevent its own death. The body formed with this power may have intrinsic powers; a body formed of fire, for example, has the same features as the *Body of Fire* power of fire elementals.

Cr(Re) Form 25 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite): Lesser Power (25 levels) OR

Cr(Re) Form 25 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite): Greater Power (25 levels, –3 Might cost, +2 Init)

#### **Eidolon**

0 points, Init equal to Qik, Imaginem R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

Creates an illusionary form that is visible and audible to material beings. The spirit can create a single form with each version of this power it possesses. The image can move and speak as directed by the spirit, and lasts until the spirit has no further use for it.

CrIm 15 (base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2 move at command, +1 intricacy): Greater Power (15 levels, +2 Init, –2 Might cost; 15 levels surplus)

#### **Ghost Touch**

Variable cost, Init equal to (Qik – Might points spent), Terram

R: varies, D: varies, T: varies

Moves objects that are not held by another or fastened down. For 1 Might point, a maximum of 5 pounds can be moved; every additional Might point doubles this weight limit. If the item is hurled with force, the spirit requires the Thrown Weapons Ability, and it inflicts +5 damage per Might point spent. If the spirit has a Martial Ability, it can enter combat with an object when using this power (most weapons weigh less than 10 pounds), and uses its Characteristics to calculate combat totals as normal. All physical attacks with this power need to penetrate Magic Resistance. The power lasts until the object is released by the spirit.

ReTe 25: Focus Power

#### **Manifestation**

4 or more points, Init equal to (Qik – Might points spent), Animal or Herbam R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind or Group

Manifests the spirit's consciousness among animals or plant life it touches, temporarily granting them a Might score equal to the Might points spent, and controlling their actions. It is a Rego Herbam effect of Level 20 to control a plant that is a pace in diameter (costing 4 Might points), and a Rego Animal of Level 25 to control a single creature of Size +1 (costing 5 Might points). For an extra 2 Might points, a group of ten standard creatures or plants (or the equivalent mass) can be controlled. For each additional 2 Might points spent, the mass of creatures or plants controlled is multiplied by 10. The spirit cannot spend more Might points on this power than the magnitude of its Magic Might. Plants can be animated (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Magic Plants) or made to grow with unnatural speed. For instance, a patch of weeds can spring up overnight, whereas a tree can grow from a seeding in a month. Humans and other sentient

## *Daimons*

The **Daimons**, or Named Spirits, embody the elements of creation, from the mighty Protogoni and the Intelligences of the Planetary Bodies, right down to the spirits of sacred groves. Ascended Magi and Heroes of Old (see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, pages 137–140) are also included within the Daimons. While they are known as the Named Spirits, this does not mean that other spirits do not have personal names, rather it is the complex series of syllables and ritual gestures that make up a True Name (see Spirits and Magic below) that is indicated.

#### **New Virtue: Daimon**

Free, Social Status (spirits only)

This free Virtue is possessed by all Daimons. All Daimons have a Confidence Score of at least 1. A Daimon is a permanent resident of the Magic Realm and cannot enter the material world; instead, it creates an Aspect as its agent on Earth. An Aspect may be created or destroyed with a moment's thought, and costs no Might points to create. Each Aspect is like an independent spirit, with some or all of the characteristics and powers of the original spirit, but its own Might score (usually a mere fraction of the parent Daimon), and its own pool of Might points. An Aspect cannot recover spent Might points, rather it is dispelled when exhausted and replaced (if necessary) with another Aspect. Defeating or destroying the Aspect has no impact on the originating Daimon, except perhaps on its disposition towards the perpetrators of these acts. No permanent changes can be made to any Aspect, as they never last. Only the Aspect

is ever trapped or bound by magic, and the Daimon can escape by discarding the Aspect. An Aspect cannot appear within several miles of another Aspect of the same Daimon, and no Aspect can return to the same location (as defined by the storyguide) within a day of leaving it. Not all Aspects created by the same Daimon need be identical; designed for different functions, they might have different powers and Mights.

An Aspect is a constant Arcane Connection of indefinite duration which is in constant mental contact with its Daimon. While an Aspect may be used to target spells of Arcane Range against its parent Daimon, few magi have sufficient power to make such spells penetrate the larger Might of the Daimon itself. A failed attempt to target a Daimon in this fashion can prove very dangerous for the impertinent magus!

beings cannot be controlled by this power. This power is particularly suitable for genii loci, who are considered to be touching any plants or creatures within their domain.

ReHe 20 or more (base 10, +1 Touch, +1 Conc) or ReAn 25 or more (base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Conc): Focus Power x 2

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

This ritual-like power either forms an Arcane Connection to a particular person or place, or makes an object into an Arcane Connection to the spirit itself. If the connection is to last for hours or days, then it costs just 1 point; a connection that lasts for weeks or months costs 2 points; years or decades costs 3 points; and indefinite Arcane Connections cost 4 points. The spirit must be in the physical location of the object it is making into an Arcane Connection, and must penetrate Magic Resistance as usual.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power

#### **Presence**

0 points, constant, Imaginem R: Arc, D: Sun, T: Ind

Grants awareness of everything that happens within the bounds of a specific domain chosen by the spirit. In essence, the spirit is coterminous with its associated landscape feature, so it is present simultaneously everywhere within its boundaries. Double the Might of a spirit with this power for the purposes of calculating Tether Strength (see Formation of Magic Auras). The spirit's Might score determines the size of area possible: a Room (5–10 Might), a Structure (15–25 Might), or a standard Boundary (30+ Might). For Daimons, every 5 Might above 30 adds 1 size modifier to the base Boundary; an Airy Spirit or animus can only ever control a base Boundary, regardless of Might. The area controlled by the spirit can produce a yearly harvest of (Might/10) pawns of vis of an appropriate Form, which manifests as physical objects within the controlled region. Harvesting this vis does not erode the spirit's Might. This power is possessed by all genii loci, and many ghosts.

InIm 35 (base 2, +4 Arc, +2 Sun, +1 constant effect, +1 non-Hermetic effects): Greater Power (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

#### **Regio**

15 points, Init equal to (Qik – 30), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Boundary, Ritual This power is only suitable for spirits with the *Presence* power. Upon using the power, a Magic regio forms at a part of the landscape inhabited by the spirit. The regio has a single layer, which has a Magic aura 1 point higher than the Magic aura of the landscape from which it came (an aura of 1 forms if there is no supernatural aura or a Divine, Faerie, or Infernal aura). This power can be used more than once to create additional layers to the regio; each additional layer has an aura 2 points stronger than the previous layer, up to a maximum of 10. The contents of each layer are determined by the spirit, but are always strongly related to its nature. The spirit controls access to the different levels of the regio, and can make an effective trap or hiding place by retreating to the second or greater layer and sealing the first layer entirely. Might points spent on this Ritual Power are permanently removed from the spirit's Might Score as well as its Might pool.

No Hermetic equivalent: Ritual Power x 3

#### **Stasis**

10 points, Init equal to (Qik – 20), Vim R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Boundary, Ritual

The spirit can cause a defined area with a Magic aura, such as a cave, a glade, or a regio level to become so remote and closed off from the outside world that the passage of time itself is altered. A mortal resident here still makes Aging rolls as normal, using the Aura strength as a Living Conditions modifier. However, any aging points are applied to the character as Warping points instead. An aging result that results in either sufficient aging points to reach the next level of Decrepitude or a Crisis, instead inflicts sufficient Warping points to reach the next level of Warping Score. Magi must still check for Twilight if they suffer two or more Warping points as a result of aging in this manner. The character's perception of the passing years and memories of his prior life gradually become hazy. Keep track of the total number of Warping points gained instead of aging (rather than from other sources); if 50 or more points are accumulated in this manner (equivalent to a Decrepitude of 4 or more), the character cannot leave a Magic aura without dying from the sudden accumulation of his missed years, but he can move from the protected area as long as he remains within a Magic aura. This might allow for legendary figures from centuries past to still endure, hidden deeply in a secret location and protected by a powerful spirit. Might points spent on this Ritual-like power are permanently removed from the spirit's Might Score as well as its Might pool.

## *Airy Spirits*

The Airy Spirits are native to the material world, unlike the Daimons that reside in the Magic Realm. While they can be conceivably found anywhere, in a Magic aura the air swarms with these spirits (thus their name), but since they have little interest in the doings of material beings, their presence usually goes unnoticed. In a Magic aura or a regio, an Airy Spirit might be present in any or every object, much as angels are responsible for the minutiae of things in the Dominion (see *Realms of Power: the Divine*, page 21, Angelic Minutiae). They may be responsible for the effects that such places have on humans: the intensity of colors, the perfusion of a particular emotion, and the intensification of experience in general. The Airy Spirits are individually unable to cause these effects (many have a Might of less than 5), and often go unnoticed due to their inability to impinge on the material world without expending their power. Nevertheless, their presence can be felt in an undefinable way, and contribute to the sense of wonder engendered by the Realm of Magic.

Some scholars contend that the act of summoning an Airy Spirit is tantamount to the creation of that spirit, and that it did not exist before the summons. The contrary argument to this is that Airy Spirits are naturallyoccurring spiritual embodiments of material things. Naturally, it is impossible to demonstrate the truth of either position, for the very act of perceiving a spirit under the second view would create it under the first view.

## *Florae and Fauni*

**Magic Might:** 1 – 25 (Herbam or Animal) **Typical Powers:** Donning the Corporeal Veil; Guide; Manifestation; Master of (Form).

The Airy Spirits that attend living beings are called fauni (for creatures, singular faunus) or florae (for plants, singular flora). Fauni are occasionally called satyroi (which confuses them with a type of faerie), and most often appear to those with Second Sight as male animals or hybrids of animal and man. The florae are also called nymphae (again, a name also used for certain faeries), and appear in female form with clearly vegetative features. These shapes are just mirrors of the observer, so a male observer might see a flora as a feminine version of his own face, whereas a faunus would appear as an animalistic version of himself.

Each represents an individual living being; thus it might be the spirit of a singular tree in a forest, an individual stag, or even a specific pack of wolves. The purpose or functioning of these spirits — if indeed they exist prior to being detected by magic — is unknown. It is possible that every living creature has such a spirit within it, and some believe that these spirits fulfill the function of the animus within these beings. Most fauni and florae possess Cunning rather than Intelligence.

**Abilities:** Charm 1 (swimmers), Local Area Lore 4 (river), Magic Lore 2 (water spirits), Swim 4+2 (close to shore)

#### **Powers:**

*Eidolon*, 2 points, Init 0, Imaginem: See Common Powers, above.

*Master of Water*, 1 point, Init +3, Aquam: duplicates any non-Ritual Perdo or Muto Aquam of 5th level or below, at a cost of 1 Might point. PeAq or MuAq 5: Focus Power (5 levels, +4 Init)

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Herbam, in the head of the bulrush it inhabited

**Appearance**: To those who can see it, this spirit appears as a young naked girl paddling in a stream, her hair piled high on top of her head like the distinctive head of a bulrush.

This spirit can be found near the river's edge, close to the rushes that gave her birth. She is a playful creature, and uses her power to make minor changes to the flow of the river around her home.

## *Spirits of the Elements*

**Magic Might:** 1 – 25 (appropriate elemental Form)

**Typical Powers:** Crafter of (Form), Donning the Corporeal Form, Ruler of (Form).

Often confused with elementals (see Chapter 8: Magic Things, Elementals), the spirits of the elements represent specific individual non-living objects. Thus the hearth fire of a great hall might have its own spirit, as might the flagstones, the water in the well, and so forth. A spirit of an element can be present in any matter that is still in its natural form: dressed stone will still possess a spirit, but metal that has been extracted from ore and formed into a ring will not. Further, a spirit of an element resides in a single individual object: a wall does not have a spirit, but each individual stone might. Spirits of the elements are therefore much more common than elementals, for they do not require the same purity of raw matter.

The Might of a spirit is closely tied to the size and importance of the object to which it is tied; a megalith from a stone circle, or the spirit of the sacred flame on a pagan altar will both have much higher Magic Might scores than a simple boulder or candle flame. A magus can use a spell that allows him to talk to a physical object (such as *Stone Tell of the Mind That Sits*) to communicate with the Airy Spirit of that object instead (if Penetration exceeds the spirit's Might, of course). The conversations that the magus has with these spirits is very much colored by their unusual ways of looking at things.

Spirits tied to the **Art of Terram** make up the bulk of these spirits; they are usually interested in hardness, rigidity, and permanence. They easily ignore soft, impermanent things like humans, but will take careful notice of the exact composition and form of their arms and armor.

Spirits tied to the **Art of Aquam** are interested in the coagulation and mixing of individual elements to make a whole, and may fail to recognize individuals in a group while immediately grasping the bigger picture. A group of armed men is clearly an object of war to one of these spirits, but they may not recognize that it is made of different individuals.

Spirits tied to the **Art of Auram** are concerned with flexibility and malleability, and are fascinated with change. They recognize the impermanence of objects, and are keenly tied to perception of change and time. They might describe a dog as "the-thing-that-was-

![](_page_103_Picture_26.jpeg)

once-a-puppy-but-is-not-yet-worm-food."

Spirits associated with the **Art of Ignem** are interested in separation and the maintenance of individual identity. They are good at recognizing specific individual objects that might appear identical to a person, and will often speak in terms of the components that make up an object, rather than considering it to be a whole. An animal is a collection of bones, organs, humors, and flesh, for example.

## *Imagines, the Spirits of Sensation*

**Magic Might:** 1 – 20 (Imaginem) **Typical Powers:** Crafter of Images, Mastery of (particular species), Ruler of Images

These unusual spirits (singular *imago*, meaning "semblance") are the embodiments of the sensory species. Thus, the species of vision produce a spirit of the redness of an apple, a spirit of the shine of polished silver, and so forth. The species of hearing have *imagines* for each individual musical note, as well as spirits of more general sounds such as howling or crashing. The spirits of taste represent sweetness, saltiness, sourness, meatiness, and the like. There are spirits for each individual smell — primroses, the earth following rain, and the stench of rotting flesh, for example — and for textures such as knobbly, furry, and sharp. The weakest of these spirits represents a specific incidence of a species, whereas those of Might 10 or more represent more-general qualities. Depending upon one's point of view, Airy Spirits may be created every time a sensory species comes into existence (and likewise destroyed when the species does), or they may be attracted to the presence of such species.

Spirits of sensation commonly have a Power that replicates a specific effect representing their particular sensory species: a spirit of the smell of rotting flesh might duplicate *Stench of Twenty Corpses*, for example.

#### **Zwergenstimme Imago**

**Magic Might:** 15 (Imaginem)

**Season**: Spring

**Characteristics:** Int 0, Per 0, Pre –1, Com +4, Str 0, Sta –1, Dex 0, Qik +3

**Virtues and Flaws:** Magic Spirit; Great Communication, Improved Characteristics, Sharp Ears

## *Airy Spirits Story Seeds*

#### **The Menagerie**

The Airy Spirits of creatures and plants are relatively weak, but what would happen if a multitude of them worked in concert? A magus decides to test this idea, and begins collecting florae and fauni from across the countryside. Soon, however, even the local villagers begin to notice a dampening of vibrance, as if an undefinable gloom hangs over the land. Meanwhile, how long can the captive spirits survive away from their natural places, and what effect does the magus hope to achieve with them?

#### **Trapped!**

An apprentice and one of the grogs are sent out to collect vis from a usually reliable source located in a system of caves nearby the covenant. Once they enter the caverns, they begin to hear strange pleading calls to them, crying out their names and weeping — little do they realize that the sounds are created by a bored zwergenstimme imago who wants only to "play" with them. They follow, but soon become lost as the echoing voice leads them further into the maze of tunnels. When they try to turn back, part of the ceiling collapses, trapping them in an isolated chamber with no escape.

#### **A Self-Important Spirit**

A particularly arrogant magus with the Mistaken Identity Flaw has unknowingly generated a spirit of emotion — that of his own sense of self-importance. The eidolon thinks that it is improving the lot of its "twin" by interfering in his affairs and raising his profile, but in actual fact it is merely antagonizing his allies with its arrogant manner.

#### **The Woes of the World**

Porphyrion of Tytalus claims to have found the jar of Pandora underneath the Senate in Rome. Was Rome's power derived from control over the lugra? Presuming that the jar he owns is really what he claims, what does Porphyrion — last spotted in Paris — intend to do with the jar now?

**Magical Qualities and Inferiorities**: Greater Power (Presence), Focus Power (Ghost Touch), Focus Power (Master of Sound), Greater Power (Bring Down the Roof) **Personality Traits:** Mischievous +3, Echo

**Reputations:** Murderous 1 (Local) **Combat:**

*Thrown Rock:* Init +3, Attack +4, Defense n/a Damage +5

**Abilities:** Awareness 4 (sounds), Folk Ken 1 (fear), Guile 1 (mimicry), Music 2 (echoes), Thrown Weapon 4 (rocks)

#### **Powers:**

+3\*

*Master of Sound*, variable points, Init +5 – Might cost, Imaginem: the spirit can duplicate any non-Ritual spell involving sound up to Level 15, at a cost of 1 Might Point per magnitude of effect. (Te)Im15: Focus Power (15 levels, +2 Init)

*Bring Down the Roof*, 2 points, Init +3, Terram: the Zwergenstimme can cause the roof of a cave to collapse, crushing any within it. This causes +20 damage, and seals the exit from the cave. PeTe 20 (base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Room, +2 Size): Greater Power (20 levels, –2 Might cost, +4 Init)

*Presence*, 0 points, constant, Imaginem: see above for the power description. The echo spirit can haunt a series of caves (constituting a Structure). See Common Powers for more details.

*Ghost Touch*, variable cost, Init +3 – Might points spent, Terram: the spirit can hurl rocks at enemies. It uses the combat scores listed above, but each attack costs 1 Might point. See Common Powers of Spirits for more details.

**Vis:** 3 pawns of Imaginem, as an immaterial echo

**Appearance**: An echo. This spirit appears only as auditory species to those with Second Sight

This spirit of an echo lurks in caves or ravines. Its name literally means "dwarf voice" in German, and these spirits have been known to mislead lost humans by "playing" with them. The spirit certainly has no intent to harm; it doesn't even understand what harm is.

![](_page_104_Picture_36.jpeg)

## *Eidolons, the Spirits of Emotions*

**Magic Might:** 5 – 30 (Mentem) **Typical Powers:** Possession, Mastery of (specific emotion)

Humans who come into contact with strong magic sometimes unconsciously create spirits that embody their emotions or memories. Some magi have discovered that a person who is experiencing a strong emotion, or else has a strong memory of emotional importance to them, can serve as an Arcane Connection to an eidolon of that emotion, which can be used to summon that spirit to the service of the magus (see Magic and Spirits, below). Further, a person who visits the Magic Realm, particularly the Sphere of Mentem, might leave behind these eidolons, and occasionally these spirits can return to earth.

A Major Personality Flaw can generate a spirit with a Magic Might of 30. Minor Personality Flaws attract a spirit of Might 20. Otherwise, the spirit has a Might equal to (5 x Personality Trait). Negative Personality Traits cannot be used to summon a spirit of that emotion, but can summon a spirit of the opposite emotion. Note that the spirit of wrath would be a very powerful Daimon indeed; more-common eidolons are the spirits of a person's wrath, rather than the tutelary spirit of the emotion as a whole. Those who can see spirits report that eidolons appear in human form, a simulacrum of the spirit's "owner," but expressing a caricature of the emotion on its face.

## *Spell Spirits*

Initiates into the Mystery of Hermetic Theurgy (*The Mysteries Revised Edition*, Chapter 9) can summon spirits with the sole power of duplicating the effects of a specific spell, or a particular Form. A spell spirit has a Might at least equal to the level of the spell, and the duration of the summoning spell determines how long the spirit attends the theurgist, ready to use its power on his command. It is a contested point as to whether these spirits form a class of their own, or whether they are variants of the other groups of Airy Spirits, but only Theurgists have any interest in such fine points of spiritual taxonomy.

## *Realms of Power*

#### **The Spirit of Self-Importance**

**Magic Might:** 10 (Mentem)

**Season**: Summer

**Characteristics:** Int 0, Per +1, Pre +3, Com +2, Str +1, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik +1

**Confidence Score:** 2 (6 points)

**Virtues and Flaws**: Magic Spirit; Self Confi-

dent; Meddler (Minor)

**Magical Qualities and Inferiorities**: Greater Power (Gift of Self Assurance), Greater Power (The Preening Peacock); Lesser Power (Donning the Corporeal Veil), Minor Virtue: Improved Characteristics x3

**Personality Traits:** Proud +3\*, Envious +2 **Abilities:** Carouse 3 (inflating self importance), Charm 4 (enemies), Craft Stories 3 (about self), Etiquette 4 (making self look better), Folk Ken 4 (the character that originated it), Guile 4 (exaggeration), Intrigue 4 (setting allies against each other), Leadership 4 (those of lower social status), Penetration 3 (Mentem)

#### **Powers:**

*Gift of Self Assurance*, 1 point, Init +2, Mentem: the spirit donates a Confidence point from its own store to assist any single action of its target. This action, if it succeeds, must make the character seem more competent in the eyes of others; this power doesn't work if the affected character is alone. CrMe 10 (base 4; +1 Touch, +1 Conc): Greater Power (10 levels, –1 Might cost, +3 Init, 10xp in Penetration)

*The Preening Peacock*, 1 point, Init +0, Imaginem: the Presence of the touched target is temporarily raised to be one point higher than the highest Presence among the target's companions. This power lasts until the target looks foolish in front of his peers, such as by failing in an important task. It can only be used once on any given being. MuIm 15 (base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Sun, +1 complexity): Greater Power (15 levels, –1 Might cost, +2 Init, 20xp in Penetration)

*Donning the Corporeal Veil*, 5 points, Init – 2, Corpus: the spirit manifests with the physical Characteristics given above. See Common Powers for more details.

**Vis:** 2 pawns of Mentem, as an immaterial corpse

**Appearance**: This spiritual copy looks like the person's idealized perception of himself; straighter, taller, more handsome, and in better clothing.

## *Spirits of Place, Genii Loci*

**Magic Might:** 15 – 45 (Herbam, Aquam, Terram; more rarely Auram). Those with a higher Might score tend to be Daimons.

**Typical Powers:** Creator of Plants, Waters, or Earth; Guide, Manifestation; Presence; Ruler of Plants, Waters, or Earth. Further, all genii loci possess the Ways of the (Land) Virtue.

Genii loci are the spirits of natural features, and are among the most powerful of all Airy Spirits. Some achieve the status of Daimon by embodying a landscape feature that has particular individual resonance. One hill among many might have an attendant Airy Spirit, but if that hill stands out from all the others, because of its distinctive shape or location, then it could well be a Daimon. In Ancient Greece, genii loci received different names according to what type of landscape they inhabited: Okeanides and Potamoi inhabited the seas and the rivers, Oreades inhabited hills and mountains, Dryades inhabited forests, and Anemoi were the spirits of specific winds. In other lands they received different names; in Germany, genii loci are called Landwichten (Land-wights in English), whereas to the Norse they are Landvaettir.

At first glance, genii loci appear similar to the spirits of elements or plants, but there is an important difference. A genius loci is not the spirit of a particular object, but instead the place where that object rests, its **locus**. The spirit actually inhabits its locus using the Presence power. A flora might reside in a single tree, whereas a genius loci might be simultaneously present in all trees in a forest. A genius loci cannot stray from its locus anymore than a person can stray from his skin; the two are inextricably linked. A genius loci is fiercely protective of its locus, and the plants and creatures who dwell within it, and will use its powers to ensure that the locus is not harmed. Some, particularly Daimons, are also the protectors of the people who dwell within their locus, and may have the Grant (Virtue) power to empower their chosen humans. A genius loci, depending on its nature, may consider the spirits of the objects and living things within its locus to be its children or its subjects; or else it might drive them away or imprison them, leaving itself the sole spiritual occupant of the locus.

![](_page_106_Picture_1.jpeg)

**Magic, Faerie, or Infernal Might:** 10 – 40 (Herbam, Aquam, or Terram)

**Typical Powers:** Those of other genii loci, as well as Donning the Corporeal Veil (often more than once, for both human and animal forms)

The jinn (singular jinni) are a variety of genii loci native to the scorched lands of Persia, the Holy Land, North Africa, and Iberia. Each jinni is associated with a specific landscape feature, such as a sand dune, a pool of water, a grove of palm trees, and so forth. Jinn can be aligned to either the Magic, Faerie, or Infernal Realms, and it is the Faerie jinn who are most familiar to the Arab people. These spirits have accepted the faith of Islam, and uphold its tenets by offering succor to devoted Muslims in their desert paradises. Infernal jinn desire only the wrack and ruin of mankind, and are evil spirits that haunt the wild places of the earth. The magical jinn, referred to as "pagan" by humans, in actual fact express no interest in humans or their religions.

Every jinni, regardless of Realm affiliation, shares the same Greater Malediction when it willingly enters a bargain, it is bound to the agreed terms unless its partner reneges first. A magical jinni enters a bargain such as this so that it may see the world; unique among genii loci, a jinni can transfer its locus temporarily to its partner in a bargain, and leave its landscape feature behind. As soon as the bargain lapses, however, it returns to its locus and must remain there until another bargain can be forged.

## *Lugra, Spirits of Hardship*

**Magic Might:** 5 – 20 (Vim) **Typical Powers:** Possession and Mastery of (a specific hardship)

The lugra (meaning "banes"), or kakodaimones, are the spirits of the hardships of life that inflict mankind. Often mistaken for demons, these spirits gain no satisfaction from their efforts, and do not target individuals for any particular reason. A lugra has a parasitic existence, inflicting its particular brand of misery on its randomly chosen host before moving on to another. Greek legend recalls how the kind and help-

## *The Jar of Pandora*

*But abhorred Eris (Strife) bore painful Ponos (Toil), and Lethe (Forgetfulness), and Limos (Starvation), and the Algea (Pains), the Hysminai (Fightings) and the Makhai (Battles), the Phonoi (Murders) and the Androktasiai (Manslaughters), the Neikea (Quarrels), the Pseudologoi (Lies), the Amphilogiai (Disputes) and Dysnomia (Lawlessness) and Ate (Ruin), who share one another's natures, and Horkos (Oath) who does more damage than any other to earthly men, when anyone, of his knowledge, swears to a false oath.*

— Hesiod, "Theogony" 226

The children of Eris were imprisoned in a jar to keep them from mankind, but the fatally curious Pandora opened the jar, releasing the lugra onto the earth. Only Elpis ("Hope") remained in the jar, so humankind retained access to this being's gifts. Many magi and sorcerers have sought out the infamous jar of Pandora, believing that it can bind the lugra to the will of its possessor; or, more altruistically, recapture the lugra and free mankind from their ills.

# *Theoi*

the connection.

**Magic Might:** 30 – 50 (Vim) **Typical Powers:** Any

and Inferiorities, and Abilities.

The Theoi ("gods" in Greek) is an informal title given to the most powerful of the Daimons. This group were rarely included in the most popular deities of a pantheon; instead they performed auxiliary roles as aspects of nature, dispensers of justice, and embodiments of cultural aspects. They were always distant from both the Faerie gods and humankind. Fundamentally, spirits of Magic do not care whether they have worshipers or not, and so they were rarely at the center of a pagan cult. For example, the myths of Ancient Greece are poorly remembered in Mythic Europe, but most scholars have basic familiarity with the major characters. However, it is minor characters such as Helios, Prometheus, and Pallas who fill the ranks of the Theoi; not Zeus or his siblings and children. Also among the Theoi are those spirits

who have attracted a cult because they represent an ideal; some Flambeau magi consider Mithras, the warrior god of the Roman legions, to be a Theos representing honor

and loyalty, the perfect soldier.

## *The Named Spirits*

The Named Spirits are all those genii who possess the Daimon Virtue; they are considered to be of a different class than the Airy Spirits. Daimons draw power from their True Names (see below, Arcane Connections, True Names and Synthemata), and interact with the mundane world through Aspects. All the game statistics for spirits in this section represent Aspects rather than the Daimon itself, which usually has a much higher Might.

Daimons dwell within the Magic Realm, and only send Aspects of themselves to earth. Each Daimon is the spiritual reflection of an aspect of the mundane world, as it appears in the Magic Realm. For example, the Daimon of a specific river resides in the Magic Realm, mostly partaking in its Aquam aspect, but also involving elements of Animal (the animals that live within it), Herbam (the plants that grow in it), and Terram (the river banks and river bottom). As a whole, the Daimon is the most perfect reflection of the mundane

## *Genii, Gods, and Worship*

The majority of gods are Faerie powers, not Magical ones. Some faeries actively crave human adoration; their entire existence may well depend upon it. This intense fascination with the mortal world makes them far more likely to be at the center of a pagan cult, either past or present. Some theurgists claim that Magical spirits control the cosmos, ordering and running it according to Divine plan. It's said that long ago some of these spirits — the first faeries — found that the worship of mankind could give them power beyond their allotted span, and they became the first gods. In a conflict called the **Titanomachia** ("War of the Titans"), the Faerie gods staged a coup and ousted the uncaring and aloof spirits of Magic from the thrones of the world. Zeus and his brothers bound the Titans in the underworld; Odin and his brothers formed the habitable world from the bodies of the slain Jotnar; and the Children of Danu drove the Fomoire to the underworld beyond the Ninth Wave. The governance of creation still flowed through the imprisoned spirits, but it was directed by the new gods who used it to the benefit of their worshipers.

Despite the Titanomachia, some Daimons have had mortal cults or religions, and some of these even persist in Mythic Europe. Genii are indifferent to man; if a human discovers a spirit and offers it worship, the spirit will rarely care enough to refuse. Over time, it may even see the benefit of having a mortal cult and offer advantages to its most devoted followers, starting a religion. The major benefit of worshipers, at least for the lower classes of spirits, is that human devotion can provide them a name, elevating them to the status of a Daimon. The formation of a new cult to a Magical spirit is unusual these days, with the Dominion spread as it has over the face of the earth, but it is not unknown. Note that as well as Faerie and Magic pagan gods, there are also demons who pose as gods to corrupt their followers through idolatry.

It is rumored among theurgists that during particularly fortuitous celestial conjunctions when a given planet is in ascendance, then an Aspect of the corresponding spirit can perform feats of magic with power matched only by that of the Divine. They believe that the Astra Planeta form a bridge between the material world and the celestial bodies across the Limit of the Lunar Sphere. At such times, it is said, Helios could bring the dead back to life, or Pyroeis could rain down Parma-shredding fire. Tales are told that Islamic sorcerers have used such powers against Hermetic magi in the past, and the fear that they will do so again has left the Order suing for peace with these wizards.

## *The Leti*

**Magic Might:** 20 – 30

**Typical Powers:** Mastery of Pain, Material Anchor, Ruler of Flesh, Sight Beyond Sight, Touch of Death (As *Clenching Grasp of the Crushed Heart*, but R: Touch, costs 6 Might)

A Letum is a spirit of death, and they come in a number of varieties, each with its eponymous leader. The Keres (lead by Ker) are the spirits of violent death, personifying death in battle or by accident. The Thanatoi (lead by Thanatos) represent a peaceful death, whose touch is gentle. The Akylides (lead by Akhlys) are the dismal green daughters of poison and disease, and the Moroi (lead by Moros) lead the doomed to their fated demise. To those who can see one, a Letum appears as a winged human entwined

## *Astra Planeta*

**Magic Might:** 40 (Vim)

**Typical Powers:** Eidolon; Guide; Material Anchor; Sight Beyond Sight; multiple versions of Master of (Form).

Among the most powerful of the Named Spirits are the Astra Planeta, or the planetary spirits. The celestial spheres that bear the seven planets are linked to the Realm of Magic through these spirits, although everything beyond the sphere of fixed stars is purely Divine. These seven spirits rule not only the physical planets themselves and their motions, but also the effects that they have on the sublunar realm. The planetary spirits were known and studied by the Greeks, who learned the science of astrology from Ancient Babylon, but they are also well known to the wizards who dwell in Arab lands. The seven Astra Planeta are:

**Selene or Al-Qamar (the moon):** Rules commoners, fertility, fruitfulness, rainfall, sailors, witchcraft, and feminine energy.

**Helios or Al-Shams (the sun):** Rules over droughts, fathers, life-giving healing, masculine energy, heat, and royalty.

**Stilbon or 'Utarid (Mercury):** Rules over falsehoods, gardens, scribes, small animals, knowledge, travelers, and stories.

**Eosophoros or Al-Zuhara (Venus):** Rules over amusement, chivalry, dances, jewels, poets, and romance.

**Pyroeis or Al-Mirrikh (Mars):** Rules accidents, dangerous animals, monsters, swords and armor, hunting, fire, and war.

**Phaethon or Al-Mushtari (Jupiter):** Rules clergy, monasteries, law, pilgrimage, science, and treasure.

**Phainon or Zuhal (Saturn):** Rules darkness, death, enemies, loss, outlaws, secrecy, prisons, and sorrow.

## *Story Seed: A Faerie Apotheosis*

Ledea of House Merinita started a healing cult around the spring of an Airy Spirit, and has already gathered a number of devotees, mainly midwifes and expectant mothers. The spirit has since become a Daimon through this cult, and now enjoys the service that her followers offer her. However, the local clergy object to the rise of paganism among the women of the region; this too is at the instigation of Ledea. She hopes

that if the Church starts to burn "witches," the spirit might start to care enough about its devotees to intervene, which Ledea believes might precipitate a conversion of the Magical spirit into a Faerie being. Servants of the characters could become victims of Ledea's machinations, or they might be left with clearing up the pieces when her plan comes to fruition.

with serpents; the violent ones are blooded and hideous with the feet of raptors, whereas the Thanatoi and Moroi are usually pleasant in appearance but with mournful faces.

Perhaps the most famous among the Leti are the Erinnyes, chthonic spirits who avenge crimes against the natural and moral order with a vengeful death. These spirits use the *Material Anchor* power to mark their prey, then hound and torment them with their other powers before ensuring an unpleasant death.

## *Other Daimons*

*Teletarch*, or "Master of Perfection" is a catch-all term used by theurgists to describe powerful embodiments of a concept or phenomenon, but they are not "gods." Some Teletarchs were once Airy Spirits (or even humans) who earned a Name and became elevated to this lofty status within the Magic Realm. Others are dread concepts that man has always known about, but avoided so as not to attract their attention.

Some Daimons were once human. An animus may become a Daimon through a process called **apotheosis**; and many mystery cults have as their ultimate goal the elevation of a being to this state of neargodhood. For more information about such Daimons and their cultic practices, see *The Mysteries, Revised Edition*.

Ghosts are another example of spiritual beings who were once human. Strictly speaking, ghosts and other transformed humans are not Daimons unless they have undergone apotheosis, but neither are they Airy Spirits, for they bear unique identities. For more information on these beings, see Ghosts, later in this chapter.

## *Primal Spirits*

**Magic Might:** Kosmokrators 50 – 75 (usually Vim); Protogonoi 75 – 100 (Vim) **Typical Powers:** Any, perhaps all.

The **Protogonoi** are the most primeval of all spirits, governing immense concepts such as sky, the waters, love, the abyss, and earth. They are said to be echoes from the Words of Creation, pure spiritual reflections of the newly created world, stored in the timeless record of the Magic Realm and made manifest of spirit. These are the mightiest creatures of magic, and have the least interest or involvement in the lives of mortals. No sorcerer has ever succeeded in summoning or channeling any of these "First-Born."

The **Kosmokrators** are the governors of the Magic Realm, the active counterparts to the passive Protogonoi; for example, the dominance of the Protogonos of Day passes to the Protogonos of Night under the auspices of a Kosmokrator of Time. While these entities may be considered spirits, their powers are so vast that they transcend categorization. In days past, it is rumored that the Kosmokrators walked the earth in immense material form, and were called Titans by the Greeks; Jotnar by the Norse; Fomoire by the Celts (see Chapter 5: Magic Humans, Giants). Theurgical legends state that the Kosmokrators were deposed by the Faerie gods and imprisoned (see Genii, Gods, and Worship, above), and now their power is channeled by the upstarts who suborned their thrones. There are some brave (and powerful) magicians who have managed to contact these spirits in whatever underworld they now inhabit, and have found them eager to escape their imprisonment and once more walk upon the earth. Some of these spirits claim to have made the world and all within it, although few place any credence in such tales.

## *Spirits and Magic*

This section summarizes information from published sources about spirit magic. Hermetic spirit magic and theurgy is detailed in *The Mysteries Revised Edition* (particularly Chapters 4, 8, and 9); whereas non-Hermetic summoning and controlling spirits can be found in *Realms of Power: The Infernal* (particularly Chapter 11).

## *Spirits and Hermetic Magic*

All magi can summon and control Airy Spirits using the Art of Rego as part of standard Hermetic Theory. These spells require an Arcane Connection; but due to the nature of Airy Spirits, this is usually easy to come by. The spell to summon an Airy Spirit requires only Duration Momentary (see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, page 29). Some magi have preserved secrets of spirit magic from their non-Hermetic roots; once Initiated into the Mystery of Hermetic Spirit Magic, a magus can use the Might of an Airy Spirit to maintain the duration of a spell indefinitely, or drain a spirit's essence to empower ritual effects in enchanted devices (see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, Chapter 8: Hermetic Spirit Magic).

Hermetic magic is not so proficient at summoning the Aspect of a Daimon. While all Hermetic magi are capable of inventing a ritual spell to summon a specific Daimon's Aspect, they can only do so if they have a Laboratory Text or a teacher who already knows the spell. Further, the spell of the non-theurgist must have a base level equal to twice the Daimon's Might. Non-theurgists generally need to use *Wizard's Communion* to achieve sufficient Penetration for such a spell to work. Those who have been Initiated into the Mystery of Hermetic Theurgy can invent these spells without needing a Laboratory Text or a teacher. Further, a Hermetic Theurgist need not have such a powerful initial spell; instead they may repeatedly cast a ritual spell of lower level (and thus higher Penetration) and achieve success through persistence rather than raw power. Hermetic Theurgists may also research and use synthemata to improve Penetration totals (see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, Chapter 9: Hermetic Theurgy for more details on the abilities of these magi).

## *Spirits and Non-Hermetic Magic*

The Goetic Arts form the basis of non-Hermetic magic used to summon and control spirits from any of the three earthly Realms. There are four Goetic Arts — namely Summoning, Ablating, Binding, and Commanding — all of which are Major Supernatural Virtues and are advanced as Arts. More information may be found in *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, Chapter 11: Ars Goetia.

The Goetic Art of Summoning may be aligned to the Magic, the Faerie, or the Infernal Realm, and is used to call spirits to the sorcerer's location. The Arts of Ablating, Binding, and Commanding are all aligned to the Infernal realm. The practitioners of these magics need not be evil, but the nature of these Arts taints any work done with them. These Arts steal power from spirits, force them into objects or beings, or demand obedience from the spirit, respectively.

Other traditions of wizards who control spirits may be found in future sourcebooks for **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition.

## *Arcane Connections, True Names, and Synthemata*

At first glance, spirits would appear to not produce **Arcane Connections**, having no solid bodies with which to generate them. However, any worldly representation of an Airy Spirit acts as an Arcane Connection to that spirit. For example, a fire acts as an Arcane Connection to the Airy Spirit of that fire. A courting couple may be used as an Arcane Connection to the spirit born of their love, and so forth. The physical location of a genius loci is an Arcane Connection to that spirit, regardless of whether it is a Daimon or Airy Spirit. Spirits using the *Material Anchor* power may intentionally form Arcane Connections. The name of an Airy Spirit serves as an Arcane Connection of indefinite duration to that spirit; although the name of a Daimon does not (one must instead research its True Name, see below). In general, Daimons are more resistant to the formation of Arcane Connections, and they occur in only a few select circumstances, such as with use of the

*Material Anchor* power.

A **True Name** is a secret name that is an expression of the spiritual essence of an entity; a special formula of strange incantations and gestures that takes only a few moments to recite, but is difficult to learn. A True Name is an Arcane Connection of indefinite duration, and is often the only Arcane Connections possible to a Daimon. Only creatures with a Might score have a True Name, but not all creatures with a Might score do. All demons, angels, and Daimons have a True Name, as do other intelligent entities with a unique personality; the storyguide is the ultimate arbiter as to which creatures have a True Name and which do not. Each True Name is a spelllike ability recorded as "True Name of (Being)" on the character sheet, and costs 5 experience points to learn. These points can come from Practice, Exposure, or Adventure; or from an Advancement Total dedicated to the appropriate (Realm) Lore. You receive one free experience point in the (Realm) Lore whenever the character learns a True Name completely.

**Synthemata** are signs, symbols, or passwords that link a magician to a supernatural creature; any being with a Might score has synthemata, regardless of whether they also have a True Name. Theurgic spells include these magical words in the formula of incantation; while granting no actual power, they are necessary for the correct operation of this magic, and remain a secret of the craft. Some magi and hedge wizards have the ability to work the correct synthemata into their magic as an intense and powerful channel to a spirit, so that they may command them through this channel. Virtues to work such magic are described in *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, pages 86–88. Knowing the True Name of a creature adds 5 to all lab totals to research synthemata for that same being.

## *Example Spirits of Places*

This section lists several example spirits of places (genii loci), together with suggestions for magically-touched characters that may inhabit them. Characters who have been exposed to such a magical spirit over an extended period may acquire magical powers in several different ways. A person may be born in an area infused with a genius loci, and thus have developed a mystical link to the spirit; in this case, the character can simply be generated with the appropriate Virtues and Flaws. A person may be granted beneficial or detrimental effects by the use of a spirit's Grant (Virtue) or Grant (Flaw) powers. The person may have either pleased or angered the spirit, or else she may be possessed by it. Alternatively, she may have bargained with the spirit in exchange for power, perhaps offering servitude. Major bargains may constitute a pact (granting the Spiritual Pact Virtue), and they are often enforced by the use of a genius loci's Oath-Swearing power. Magi might even be able to engage in a deep mystical communion with such a spirit, in order to initiate Mystery Virtues. Characters who have been under a spirit's influence for a long time may have developed a Warping Score, and may thus have gained one or more Flaws as well as a mystical Virtue, as detailed in **ArM5**, page 168. Many, but not all, genii loci tend to have a general antipathy towards human intrusion into their domains.

Each of the genii loci listed is a specific place in Mythic Europe. However, they serve equally well as examples of types of geographical features that can appear elsewhere, and so you can easily adapt them to other locations, should you wish. For more details of the powers of the spirits given here, see the lists earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 4: Characters, Common Powers. The characters associated with each example may be used as story seeds.

Numerous examples of forest genii loci may also be found in *Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal*. A powerful cave genius loci is located at the Cave of Twisting Shadows, the domus magna of House Criamon, in the Alps; see *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* for more details.

## *New Spirit Spells and Spell Guidelines*

All spells to summon, perceive, or control a spirit must penetrate its Magic Might. The Aspect of a Daimon can be controlled, but Daimons will typically dissolve the Aspect if a magus attempts this.

#### **Intellego (Form)**

Note: No demons can be detected by these spells.

**Level 1:** Sense a supernatural creature of Might 50 or above with a Might associated with the Form.

**Level 2:** Sense a supernatural creature of Might 40 or above with a Might associated with the Form.

**Level 3:** Sense a supernatural creature of Might 30 or above with a Might associated with the Form.

**Level 4:** Sense a supernatural creature of Might 15 or above with a Might associated with the Form.

**Level 5:** Sense any supernatural creature with a Might associated with the Form.

## **Example Spell: Perceive the Firewalker**

InIg 30 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision To the eyes of the caster, all creatures with a Might aligned to Ignem (and whose Might is lower than the caster's Penetration Total) are cast in a red sheen. This spell allows the caster, for example, to distinguish a fire elemental from a normal fire, a Salamander of Virtue from an ordinary lizard, and see spirits of fire that are normally invisible, as well as creatures of other Realms who are associated with fire, other than demons.

(base 5, +1 Conc, +4 Vision)

#### **Rego (Form)**

Spells of a specific Form can command any spirit tied to that Form. For example, Ignem can command any fiery spirit. An Arcane Connection is always needed to summon a spirit.

**Level 5**: Control an Airy Spirit of (Form). **Level 15**: Summon an Airy Spirit of (Form).

#### **Rego Vim**

**General**: Summon an Aspect of a Daimon if (level + 4 magnitudes) equals or exceeds twice its Might. (Ritual)

**Level 5**: Control an Airy Spirit of a specific Realm.

**Level 15**:Summon an Airy Spirit of a specific Realm.

## *Mount Etna*

A powerful and violent spirit of fire, Adranus, slumbers beneath a mountain on the Mediterranean island of Sicily. It has developed an antipathy towards the local peoples, since they long ago ceased worshipping it as a god. Nevertheless, it is satisfied when mortals stay away from its slopes and live in a state of respectful fear, but should they become too bold, disrespectful, or forgetful, the genius loci will become irritated and its sleep will be disturbed. Its wrath gradually builds up until the need to vent its fury is overwhelming, at which point the volcano erupts with spectacular and devastating force. Those few who venture onto the blasted and rocky slopes of the mountain have been known to go insane.

In ancient times, Adranus was worshiped by the primitive inhabitants of Sicily as a god of fire. When the Romans rose to prominence it was cast out by Vulcan, their god of fire and forge, but has since returned, and wreaks occasional and spectacular violent retribution on those who no longer either honor or fear it. A gateway to the Underworld was believed by the ancients to be situated beneath Etna. When using the Manifestation power, Adranus usually possesses one or more Sicilian eagles, the only creatures who will brave the mountain's heights. The volcano last erupted in 1194, and, if your saga follows real history, will next erupt in 1222.

**Appearance**: Mount Etna is a conical and blasted peak that rises ten thousand feet above the eastern end of the island of Sicily.

## *The Rhinefalls*

Passage along the upper stretches of the Rhine, one of Europe's great rivers, is blocked by a mighty waterfall that is the home of the river's genius loci. Long ago the Rhine was tempestuous and unnavigable, until the ancient races of dwarfs and giants tamed it. At this spot, a group of giants hurled a mighty rock into the river, pinioning the spirit there. Thus the river was tamed, making it safe for boating. Ever since, the river spirit has only been able to exercise the full extent of its powers at the waterfalls, which only the most foolhardy of boatsmen attempt to pass. The river spirit can, however, sense along the whole of its length, and it resents those who presume to traffic up and down it, paying it no heed. It longs to be released from the falls so that it may be free to exert its full power over its whole domain. The spirit may be assuaged by sacrificing items of mundane wealth to the waters. It is rumored that a mighty treasure, the Rhinegold, lies somewhere at the bottom of the Rhine. For more details, see *Guardians of the Forests: The Rhine Tribunal*, page 41.

**Appearance**: The river Rhine plunges down eighty feet in an almighty torrent over a set of cataracts at its upper stretches, south of the Black Forest. A rocky island is perched perilously at the center of the falls, and houses the spirit's regio.

## *The Desert of al-Meraya*

The spirit of a desert in the hot, dry lands of southern Iberia has an unbearable thirst for water, and sucks dry all the rains and waters that flow into it. It also has an urge to expand, encroaching on nearby lands and parching them dry. Any attempts by nearby inhabitants to tame or destroy it through irrigation will cause annoyance, although it will greedily suck up any water diverted into its domain. This uninhabited region is generally left well alone by the local Moors, except for occasional madmen and mystics who venture in, seldom to return. The citizens of al-Meraya are forced to make their living

## *Story Seeds for Spirits of Places*

**Fire and Fury**

Maria, a young woman living in a village not far from Mount Etna, feels a strange empathy for fire, and she can predict the activity of the volcano through her dreams (she has the Visions Flaw). Her pregnant mother was the only survivor when the volcano destroyed the village during its last eruption a generation ago — only she heeded the warnings and made a miraculous escape. Maria, born with the same talent as her mother, makes dire predictions of an imminent eruption and begs the villagers to assuage the fire spirit to prevent it. They, however, scoff at her heathen mumblings, and so it looks as if the fire spirit will indeed return with a vengeance.

#### **Alone in the Wilderness**

An ancient hermit, Ismail, has lived out in the desert of al-Meraya for as long as anyone can remember. He doesn't seem to mind the oppressive heat and parched landscape, and has the ability to commune with the spirit. He can find hidden water in the desert (due to his Dowsing Virtue, gained from Warping), and has an uncanny knack for predicting when the rains will come. If there is a local drought, he may be sought out for aid. He also allows the desert spirit to possess him, so that it may communicate with the outside world.

#### **The Torrent Unleashed**

Schwall, an elderly and reclusive magus with great proficiency in Aquam, has befriended the river spirit of the Rhine and established his hidden sanctum inside a regio at the waterfalls. He formerly belonged to the Rhine covenant of Rheinstein, but since its destruction he has not been heard from. Schwall fears the onset of his Final Twilight — powerful magical effects and the influence of the spirit have caused him to gain many Warping Points and Twilight Scars — and he seeks an immortality of sorts by mystically merging his own consciousness with that of the spirit, transforming himself into water. He also hopes to achieve the release of the spirit from the falls, which would likely cause trade and settlement along the river to be devastated, since the river spirit revels in great torrents and floods.

#### **The Favored Fisherman**

Wecelo is an expert fisherman able to navigate Lake Brienz better than anyone the villagers can remember. As a young man, he was among a group of boatsmen lost in a storm on the lake. Perhaps because he drew the fancy or the pity of the lake spirit, he was the only one saved from drowning. Ever since, he has felt a great longing to stay by the lake. Wecelo is likely to be sought out by anyone seeking passage across (or into) the lake, or who is interested in its denizens, fish or otherwise.

#### **Cavern of Wonders**

Ciaran, a feral boy, lives in Aillwee Cave and steals things from a nearby village on behalf of the spirit. In exchange, the cave provides him with shelter and nourishment. As a baby, the boy was abandoned in the cave, and was believed to have perished. However, the genius loci saw to it that he survived, and has adopted him. Ciaran may be found attempting to steal from travellers nearby, and their search for their missing belongings may lead them to the cave and its hidden riches.

from trade, since the parching influence of the desert generally causes most agriculture on their lands to fail. The spirit may manifest itself as any desert creature.

**Vis:** 8 pawns of Terram vis; 4 pawns per year can also be harvested from deep inside the desert.

**Appearance**: This desert is located about a dozen miles to the north of the Moorish port city of al-Meraya (Almeria), in the southeast of Iberia. It is a forbidding landscape of sandy, rocky soil, thinly dotted with scrub plants and cacti. By day it is oppressively hot, by night, unpleasantly cold.

## *Lake Brienz*

A secretive and enigmatic spirit is the embodiment of a steep-sided Alpine lake. It is deep, dark, and often wreathed in mist. Old as the mountains themselves, no one knows what ancient wisdom or mystery it may conceal in its depths. Currently, the spirit has a benevolent attitude to mankind, since it finds that the lake's fish (some of which are magical) itch, and so it is more than happy for fishermen to fish it. Should the locals start a tannery on its shore, however, it will likely become angered.

A subterranean spirit of emptiness takes the form of a twisting cave complex underground. It hungers for shiny, material things, and is opposed to those mortals who presume to steal its precious minerals and crystals. Using its powers to control the earth, the spirit has been known to change the arrangement of the network of chambers, closing off or diverting tunnels and thereby trapping people within.

### *Magic*

## *Ghosts*

*As the day belongs to the living, so the night is given to the dead.*

— Theitmar of Merseburg, Bishop of Utrecht

Not all ghosts belong to the Magic realm; there are Infernal and Faerie ghosts as well. Magical ghosts remain tied to the world through some overwhelming emotion or personal need. If its connection is somehow resolved, the ghost passes from the world, never to return.

Every ghost is unique. Some are rational and fully aware of their surroundings, while others are clearly mad or delusional. Because ghosts vary so much in their mental states, some magi suggest that there are several different kinds of ghosts, or that certain ghosts are really other sorts of spirits (such as Airy Spirits) that have been misidentified.

One common ghost in medieval stories claims to be a dead person who has returned from the afterlife. Magi call them **apparitions**. Some apparitions are Infernal ghosts (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 36); those that are Magical have some strong emotional tie to the living world, which they desperately want to resolve. Apparitions look and behave much as they did in life, with complete memories of their lives and normal awareness of their surroundings. Magical apparitions know that they are dead and seek the help of the living so they can pass on to the afterlife. They can explain what is binding them to the mortal world and how the living can help them.

Usually, laying an apparition to rest requires performing some important service at the ghost's behest. This can be anything from bringing the ghost's murderer to justice, to taking care of a loved one who has been left behind, to making amends to some person the ghost grievously wronged in life.

It might seem that apparitions, who can appear calm and rational, would be among the safest ghosts to deal with. This appearance can be deceptive. Apparitions are completely obsessed with resolving their worldly ties. They may not be content to simply ask for help, instead resorting to trickery or force. Even a well-meaning apparition can fly into a dangerous rage if characters oppose its aims.

Apparitions usually possess all of the memories and Abilities they had in life. In order to resolve their mortal ties, they must be able to communicate with the living. The most common ways they do so are through powers such as Eidolon and Donning the Corporeal Veil (see Common Powers of Spirits, earlier in this chapter), or by appearing in dreams.

Most other kinds of ghost are less lucid than apparitions. Another broad category of ghosts, which magi call **shades**, resemble distorted reflections of once-living people. Like apparitions, shades are connected to the liv-

## *The Restless Dead in Medieval Legend*

Medieval tales and illustrations of the restless dead portray them in a variety of ways. With the rules in this book, you can design your own restless dead to bring an authentic medieval feel to your ghost stories.

In some medieval stories, ghosts are invisible. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV wrote of a haunting at his castle in Prague. Leaving a fire burning at night, he was awakened by the sound of footsteps, but his manservant was still lying in the next bed. All the doors and windows were locked. The Emperor ordered his servant to light some more candles and pour a cup of wine. Shortly after he set the cup down, it was picked up and thrown against the wall, as if by an invisible hand.

Medieval stories generally describe ghosts as "spirits," but seem to attribute a corporeal nature to them. In a tale from Yorkshire, in England, a young man was able to wrestle with a ghost and hold it against the door of a church. In another story from the same region, a tailor named Snowball was attacked and wounded by a ghost, which knocked him off his horse. The spirit power of Donning the Corporeal Veil is very appropriate for these kinds of medieval-style ghosts.

In a few medieval stories, ghosts have the ability to change shape. The ghost that attacked Snowball was in the form of a crow when it wounded him; it also took the forms of a dog, a goat, and a man. When a ghost can take non-human forms, those forms may give symbolic clues about the ghost's nature. For example, the form of a dog may indicate loyalty.

![](_page_114_Picture_38.jpeg)

ing world through some overwhelming emotional tie; but unlike apparitions, they are so influenced by that connection that it dominates their entire existence. They become a kind of mental caricature of their former selves, reshaped by their own passions and the trauma of death. While shades have a capacity for reason, they exist perpetually in a state of intense emotion, which clouds and dominates their thinking.

Shades' memories are complete only in matters related to their worldly ties. All their other memories are confused and fragmentary. For example, the shade of a man who died in a plague, having also lost his beloved wife and children, will remember every detail of his family but will only dimly remember his neighbors and may have no memories at all of his own childhood. Shades tend to have a distorted sense of time, often limited to reliving the few days or even hours before their own deaths. They are often delusional and may mistake new people and surroundings for ones that were familiar to them in life. They have trouble remembering living people they meet after their own deaths, which can make it difficult to establish any new relationship with them.

Ghostly warders, like the example on page 193 of **ArM5**, are shades, with an emotional connection to watch over another character (someone they knew in life).

Another major category of ghost are **spectres**, spirits who doggedly continue the roles they had in life. Ghostly miners who died in a cave-in, ghostly sailors whose ship haunts the waters where it sank, or ghostly soldiers who appear on certain nights to reenact their final battle are all examples of spectres. They differ from apparitions and shades in that their ties to the world are less personal and more related to their occupation or role. Because their worldly ties are rather abstract, it can be difficult to lay them to rest by resolving those ties.

![](_page_115_Picture_6.jpeg)

Some within the Church think that spectres are souls being punished for impious behavior, but magi are more inclined to think they are a kind of shadow of a human mind created through a combination of traumatic death and an unknown mystical phenomenon. Some magi think they are not ghosts at all, but a kind of Airy Spirit. The ghostly soldiers of House Tremere's army (see *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, pages 126- 127) are spectres.

## *Ghosts as Characters*

Ghosts in **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition are spirits with no true material form and must have the Magic Spirit special Virtue (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, New Virtues and Flaws).

While ghosts in medieval legends were often portrayed as material beings (see sidebar), the ability to materialize is treated as a supernatural power. Not all ghosts can do it.

#### **Concept**

The starting point for designing a ghost is to identify its connection to the world. A good source of ideas are the Flaws listed on pages 38-39 of **ArM5**. Most Major Personality Flaws and some Story Flaws provide a good basis for this worldly connection. Most ghosts should have one of these Flaws to define their mortal ties.

The personalities of ghosts are as varied as those of living people. Some are tragic beings who seek only to make amends for the great mistakes of their lives, while others are hateful spirits who delight in terrorizing the living. Strive to make each ghost in your stories unique and memorable.

Generate the Characteristics for a ghost as if it were a human character. The ghost's physical Characteristics are used when it takes material form, or when it interacts with other ghosts or spirits.

All ghosts should have the special Virtue, Magic Spirit (see Chapter 4: Magical Characters, New Virtues).

![](_page_115_Picture_16.jpeg)

### *Magic*

When a human becomes a ghost, his former Social Status Virtue or Flaw becomes meaningless. All ghosts should have one of the following Social Status Virtues or Flaws: Magical Champion, Magical Covenfolk, Magical Master, Magical Monster, or Magical Friend. If the player wishes, he can choose a second Social Status as well, representing the character's status in life. Social Status Virtues bought in this way must be paid for with Flaws, but Social Status Flaws carried over from life grant no Virtue points to the ghost. (It is only necessary to choose a second Social Status Virtue or Flaw if it grants access to a restricted set of Abilities needed for the ghost's concept.)

Not all Virtues and Flaws apply to ghosts. For example, death releases a character from an Oath of Fealty and makes irrelevant such physical traits as Fragile Constitution. The player or storyguide should simply disregard any Virtues and Flaws that don't make sense.

Most ghosts should have either a Major Personality Flaw or a Story Flaw to represent their worldly ties.

#### **Season and Abilities**

Ghosts can be designed as any Season. Like living humans, they cannot choose Abilities from a restricted category (Academic, Martial, or Arcane) unless they have a Virtue or Flaw that allows them to.

**Apparitions,** who have the clearest memories of their Abilities from life, should usually be designed as Autumn characters.

**Shades,** who have lost some of their knowledge and Abilities, are most easily represented as Summer characters but could also work as Spring or Autumn.

**Spectres,** who have lost most of their knowledge and Abilities, should be Spring (or occasionally Summer) characters.

#### **Sir Giles, a Ghostly Knight**

## *Where do Ghosts Come From?*

Some ghosts are of Infernal origin: twisted souls sent to plague or corrupt the living (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal,* page 36). There are also Faerie ghosts. Magical ghosts come from the Magic realm (this can be proved with Intellego Vim spells), but that simple fact does not fully explain a common form of haunting.

In Mythic Europe, the Western Church accepts the concept of Purgatory — a kind of antechamber to Heaven where the souls of the dead suffer punishment to cleanse them of sins they committed in life. The ghosts of people who followed that faith (in life) frequently claim to be visiting the living world from Purgatory, and indeed can give lurid descriptions of the torment they suffer there.

The Church teaches that specific religious observances — prayers, masses, and almsgiving in the deceased's name — can speed a soul's passage through Purgatory and into Heaven. Some ghosts (specifically, apparitions) request exactly these favors from the living. But for story purposes, it may be useful to have a ghost to request a more active form of assistance, such as completing a quest on the ghost's behalf.

Church scholars do not agree on where Purgatory is located in relation to the earth, Heaven, and Hell. One popular hypothesis is that the souls of the dead spend the day in Purgatory at the center of the earth, and return by night to visit the earthly places where they committed their sins. Some magi suggest that, for mysterious reasons, ghosts may arrive on earth by passing through the Magic Realm.

The ghosts themselves do not always understand their own situation — indeed, some don't even realize they're dead. Death does not imbue a person's spirit with any special knowledge or insight. Magical ghosts are left to draw their own conclusions about the strange and bewildering experience of becoming a restless spirit. Not surprisingly, they usually describe their new status in terms of their own religious beliefs. Thus, the ghost of a longdead Roman citizen may say he has been wandering the Underworld, while that of a Christian peasant would claim to be suffering in Purgatory.

What is not clear is whether the ghosts' conclusions are actually correct. While some of them certainly believe they experience the afterlife in a familiar form, this could be an elaborate delusion. Some magi say that the trauma of death could cause a person's spirit to retreat into a kind of private dream world, made tangible (to the ghost) within the Magic Realm.

Most other creeds, including Judaism, Islam, and the Eastern Church, do not accept the concept of Purgatory. Ghosts who (in life) belonged to those faiths never claim to come from Purgatory, though they may say they come from limbo or some other place. Magi are divided on what this means. Some (generally those from outside the Western Church) say it's because Purgatory does not really exist. Others say that Purgatory exists, but only those of the "true" faith go there. Still others say that studying ghosts on earth can never be conclusive because there is no way to tell whether the ghosts are delusional. A more extreme view is that some, or even all, ghosts are actually demons in disguise, who invent lies so people will doubt their religion's teachings.

What is clear is that when a ghost asks for prayers or masses, providing these things usually enables the ghost to pass on to whatever its eternal fate may be. Whether this is because they actually work, or because the ghost only believes they will work, is of little practical importance.

From the point of view of an **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition game, the powers, personality, and role of a ghost within the story are more important than its metaphysical status. Exactly what happens to a person's spirit after death can be left mysterious. It should be pointed out that folk traditions regarding ghosts do not coincide precisely with theological doctrine. Who is to say whether the scholarly writings of bishops, or the tales of old village women, are closer to the truth?

## *Story Seed: Repentance*

The spirit of a local knight who died in battle some years ago still haunts his former lands, terrorizing the countryside in an attempt to force the living to lay him to rest and end what he thinks are the torments of Purgatory. Sir Giles believes his great sin was that he killed another knight in tournament. His eagerness to win glory was so great that he killed his opponent through excessive force. He thinks that

if he can ensure his victim's widow is well cared for, he'll be able to go to Heaven. In fact, he is quite mistaken. His real sin is the pride that drove him to kill his opponent and even now prevents him from true repentance. Only when he comes to terms with how his pride stands in the way of his redemption, and how it caused suffering to others, will he truly pass on.

## *Chapter Eight*

# *Magic THings*

The power of magic touches inanimate objects as often as it touches the living. Sometimes that power becomes concentrated as raw vis. While all raw vis is valuable to magi, rare forms have additional powers that make them even more desirable. Some items are not vis, but are still imbued with power by the realm of Magic; these are the Herbs and Objects of Virtue. Items and plants can also be awakened, giving them a certain amount of consciousness, but generally no Might score.

Finally, the power of Magic can fully animate pure substances, creating the elementals.

Extraordinary vis may emulate a magical device or replicate a spell. The magical effects of extraordinary vis and any ritual required to activate them are not always obvious. The existence of the special powers of extraordinary vis may be uncovered through the spell *Sense the Nature of Vis*. When the spell is cast, rather than only seeing the appropriate aura to identify the vis, the magus sees something else. The additional visual clues are always associated with the specific type of powers the extraordinary vis embodies. These visual clues might include flashes of light, sparks, or a smoky cloud. To fully investigate the extraordinary vis, the character must investigate lesser enchantment vis as he would a magical device with the same power level. Spell-like vis may also be investigated in the laboratory; the Laboratory Total to discover the vis' power and triggering event is equal to half the spell level of the spell-like vis.

Extraordinary vis naturally exists in the Magic realm. It is not the creation of a magus for himself or others. Therefore, extraordinary vis is just as likely to have inherent powers that are inconvenient or annoying to magi as it is to have beneficial powers. Because the extraordinary vis exists independently of the human world, it never has powers requiring a user to maintain concentration, and the magical effects

## *Vis*

Vis is the physical embodiment of magic, essentially raw magical power. Within vis, magic exists in its most concentrated form; as such, vis is capable of producing powerful magical effects either when used in a spell or completely on its own. Vis is also the lifeblood of the Order of Hermes. It powers the magi's spells, serves as their currency, and is the source of many of their conflicts. Vis is such an integral part of Hermetic life that most magi take its existence for granted and only stop to ask where they can get more of it. In addition to the perpetual hunt for vis, the vis itself can provide a source of adventures and obstacles for characters to overcome.

## *Extraordinary Vis*

In some very special places of great magical power, vis can take on the attributes of the magic that produces it — giving it powers beyond its normal Hermetic uses. This vis is usually found within the upper levels of powerful regiones, in potent auras, or within the remains of great magical creatures.

of extraordinary vis usually have a Range of Personal or Touch. Transferring extraordinary vis from its native form to another shape always destroys any special powers the vis possesses. Extraordinary vis often takes the form of an object containing multiple pawns of vis. A reasonable guideline is 1 pawn per 10 levels of the magical effect produced by the extraordinary vis.

#### **Lesser Enchantment Vis**

This form of extraordinary vis emulates a lesser enchantment, usually level 30 or lower. Unless otherwise noted, the use of the vis' magical effect does not consume or diminish the vis in any way. At any point, a magus may employ the vis for all of its normal uses. The magical effect of the vis

![](_page_119_Picture_4.jpeg)

In general, the magical effects of the special vis lasts as long as the vis remains intact and is not used for Hermetic purposes, but the troupe may wish to put some upper limit on the number of uses or the life span of the vis. This is especially appropriate for vis that is "consumed" by the activation process. For example, a pawn of Imaginem vis in the shape of peppercorns that make any food they are crushed over taste delicious should not last forever.

#### **Looking Glass of Intellego Vis** InIm Level 14

Pen 0, constant effect

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Room

This Intellego vis is in the form of a small piece of glass. If the glass is held against a wall, the character can see through as if the glass were a window into the room. The glass does not provide illumination or allow the character to see things obscured by any objects in the room.

(Effect: Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Room; Modifications +1 2 uses per day, +3 environmental trigger)

#### **Icicle of Perdo Vis** PeIg Level 25

Pen +12, constant effect

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

This icicle of Perdo vis never melts. Anyone who touches it loses a Fatigue level. If multiple pawns of the vis are stored in the same area, they chill a room to the point of being uncomfortably cold. If a rook or more is stored in the same room, anyone who enters loses a Fatigue level for each Diameter in the room unless protected by heavy winter clothing.

(Effect: Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; Modifications +1 2 uses per day, +3 environmental trigger, +6 Penetration)

#### **Dust Devil of Auram Vis**

CrAu Level 9

Pen 0, constant effect

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

This small whirlwind of Auram vis provides a constant breeze of fresh air that keeps the air breathable even in an airtight room. The Auram vis may only be transported with magic or in a hermetically sealed container.

## *Story Seeds for Lesser Enchantment Vis*

#### **Guilty Secrets**

The covenant busybody learns of the properties of the extraordinary Looking Glass of Intellego vis and "borrows" it to watch the business of the other covenant members. The busybody witnesses someone commit a crime and is torn between exposing the wrongdoer (and so also exposing his own thievery) and letting the crime go unpunished. Should the busybody come forward and identify the criminal, but not his own misdeeds, his story rings untrue; he fails the test of the *Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie*, and becomes a suspect in the crime.

#### **A Frozen Find**

A local noble has discovered the source of the extraordinary Icicle of Perdo vis and has several pawns in his cellar, which keeps one small room at freezing temperatures. He enjoys showing off to his visitors by serving them chilled drinks on the hottest days of the summer. Do the magi attempt to barter for the vis, which the noble does not part with cheaply, or do they just take the vis?

#### **Ill-conceived Illumination**

An unscrupulous local priest has discovered the extraordinary Ball of Light Ignem vis and is using it to stage "miracles" to improve the sales of his fake artifacts. A friend of the covenant learns of the priest's activities and asks the characters to investigate.

#### **Spring Breezes**

The first spring breeze in a magical valley produces several pawns of extraordinary Dust Devil of Auram vis. Should someone harvest all of the vis, spring does not come to the valley. Plants do not bloom, animals do not give birth, and summer does not come until at least 1 pawn of the vis is returned to the valley.

#### **Un-natural Instincts**

A highwayman discovers a source of extraordinary Mistletoe Sprig of Herbam vis and its powers. He uses it to outfit his band of brigands. They use their powers to control a nearby forest and evade capture. The brigands prevent the characters from receiving their normal visitors and harass those who dare to venture into the thieves' forest.

#### **Laughter and Joy**

In a nearby village, where the Old Ways are still respected, local couples are married in a very special grove. The first joyful laugh of the bride and groom after the marriage vows are completed contains extraordinary Laughter of Mentem vis. How do outsiders with dubious social skills get an invitation each year? When present, how do they ensure that the couple laughs genuinely when those with the Gift are present?

#### **The Warped Wizard**

A magus with a high Parma Magica discovers several pawns of extraordinary Brimstone of Vim vis and trades it to a junior magus with a weaker Parma Magica. The magus falls into Wizard's Twilight. When he returns, he brings charges against the senior magus at the next Tribunal.

**Laughter of Mentem Vis**

ReMe Level 30 Pen 0, unlimited R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

If this vis is captured, anyone who hears its laughter is filled with overwhelming joy. The listener forgets all earthly concerns and is overcome with happiness. Appropriate Personality Trait rolls are modified by +5 and the listener suffers –2 on any rolls that require thought or concentration.

**Brimstone of Vim Vis**

CrVm Level 25

Pen +10, constant effect

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

This Vim vis is in the shape of a piece of brimstone that exudes a strong smell of sulfur. Anyone who comes into contact with the vis receives a burst of magic that results in the target gaining one Warping Point.

(Effect: Base 5, + 1 Touch; Modifications +10 Unlimited, +5 Penetration)

#### **Spell-like Vis**

Some extraordinary vis produces a magical effect that mimics a high-level spell, usually of level 60 or lower. Unlike lesser enchantment vis, spell-like vis cannot produce a continuous magical effect and is completely consumed at the end of the effect. The activation of the vis may require that it be consumed by the recipient of the effect, or it may wither and degrade in some other obvious way at the expiration of the magic. In any case, the operation of the magical effect completely depletes the vis. The magical effect generally requires some specific triggering event or special circumstances to initiate the spell-like effect.

**Seed of Creo Vis**

CrHe Level 40

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

This Creo vis takes the form of a seed from a fruit tree. When planted the seed grows instantly into a mature non-magical tree laden with the appropriate fruit. The seed need not be planted deep in the earth; it grows to maturity if covered by just a handful of dirt. But the tree survives only if planted in an appropriate location and climate.

(Base 40)

**Ash Branch of Muto Vis** MuCo Combined Level 35

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

This Muto vis is contained in a branch from an ash tree. The ash tree is known as the Tree of Odin and some believe that it grants success in battle. If the bearer of this Muto vis makes an Attack roll in battle, he gains the Virtues Reserves of Strength and Toughness for Sun Duration.

**Rosemary Sprig of Rego Vis**

ReHe Level 55 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Str, Ritual

This Rego vis takes the form of a sprig of rosemary. If the vis is hung above the main entrance of a home, it protects all within the dwelling from faerie creatures of the wood with Might 15 or less. Hanging the rosemary above a door completely depletes the vis. The effect has a Penetration total of 15.

(Base effect 15, +2 Moon, +3 Structure)

**Egg of Animal Vis**

## *Story Seeds for Spell-like Vis*

#### **Enigmatic Apples**

A very old apple tree sits in the heart of an ancient forest. The first apple that naturally falls from the tree each autumn contains spell-like Seed of Creo vis. An apple taken from the tree contains no vis. If the characters arrive too late in the fall, the ground will be covered with apples from the magical tree. The apples are delicious and local animals may eat them before the characters arrive.

#### **The Bully and the Branch**

A headstrong apprentice is tasked with collecting spell-like Ash Branch of Muto vis, but the master does not explain the special powers of the vis and only instructs the apprentice to avoid combat at all costs. The apprentice does not and is asked to explain why the vis is depleted when he returns to the covenant.

#### **Changeling**

A Faerie Lady sends her minions out each Vernal Equinox to collect an infant child and replace it with a changeling. The villagers are aware of this custom and use spell-like Rosemary Sprig of Rego vis to protect their children. The characters cannot harvest the vis without dealing with the villagers. Should the Faerie Lady discover that the characters are thwarting her attempt to collect an infant child, she is very displeased with them.

#### **Venomous Vis**

An Animal magus collects several pawns of spell-like Egg of Animal vis, but never investigates their special properties. On a particularly warm day, the magus's lab becomes filled with the venomous snakes. If any of the snakes escape, the covenant may be overrun by them the following spring.

![](_page_120_Picture_46.jpeg)

for one hour, fully-grown poisonous snakes emerge from the egg. A simple die + 14 determines the number of snakes that emerge.

(Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 Size)

**Drop of Spring Water of Aquam Vis** CrAq Level 20

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

This Aquam vis takes the form of a drop of water from a magical spring. If the vis ever comes into contact with the bare earth, a fast-flowing spring forms on the spot. The spring does not form if it touches the floor of a structure, but a spring is created upon any patch of ground, even if it is solid rock.

(Base 5, +1 Touch)

**Yarrow of Corpus Vis** CrCo Level 40

R: Touch, D: Mom T: Ind, Ritual

This Corpus vis takes the form of yarrow, which is also known as soldier's wort. When the leaves of the plant are crushed and applied to a character's wounds, they heal completely. The plant only heals physical injuries and has no effect on Wound levels caused by disease or poison, nor does it restore missing limbs.

(Base 35, +1 Touch)

**Crystal of Imaginem Vis** PeIm Level 20

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

This Imaginem vis is in the form of a rock crystal. If a character holds the crystal to his eye in the light of the sun, the character becomes invisible as per *Veil of Invisibility*. The character remains invisible until the magic expires.

(As per *Veil of Invisibility*, **ArM5**, page 146)

**Silver Coin of Terram Vis** MuCo(Te) Level 45

R: Per, D: Moon, T: Ind

This Terram vis takes the shape of a silver coin in the possession of a minor faerie. If a character takes the coin without the permission of the faerie, the next time the character stands under the noonday sun he turns into stone for Moon Duration. The effects of being a statute are detailed in the spell description for *The Silent Vigil*. (See **ArM5**, page 132). The character may not choose to end the effect before it expires.

(Base 25, +3 Moon, +1 for special effect)

## *Dedicated Vis*

Dedicated vis is a form of vis that may be used in Hermetic magic to greater effect than normal vis. Dedicated vis is rare and highly sought by magi. Dedicated vis provides an enhancement in each of the three categories below: spell use, study, and enchantment creation. Each pawn of dedicated vis has a specific Technique and Form combination; the enhanced effects of the vis only apply when the vis is used for that specific combination.

When a magus casts *Sense the Nature of Vis* on dedicated vis, the colors he sees are a mottled combination of the appropriate Technique and Form of the dedicated vis. Although in most ways dedicated vis is treated identically to 2 pawns of vis — one Technique and one Form — the vis may not be disaggregated into separate pawns of vis. Likewise, transferring dedicated vis from its native form to another shape eliminates the special powers of the vis.

#### **Spell Use**

When dedicated vis is used to power a spell with the proper combination of Arts, the vis is treated as if it were twice as effective. In other words, a magus using dedicated vis enjoys a vis boost of +4 per pawn used. Dedicated vis may also be used to aid a spell that utilizes only one of the Technique and Form combination, but the dedicated vis does not provide any benefit in addition to that provided by normal vis. Likewise, when dedicated vis is used in an application that shares the same Technique and Form combination, whether it be casting a Ritual spell or creating a magic item, the vis is twice as effective. A single pawn of dedicated vis counts as 2 pawns of vis when casting a Ritual or creating a magic item that uses the appropriate combination of Arts. In any situation where the magus must make a botch roll, the dedicated vis also counts double.

#### **Study**

A magus who studies dedicated vis may gain experience in each of the appropriate

## *Story Seeds for Spell-like Vis (con't)*

### **The Deadly Drought**

Drought strikes the region, crops are dying and rivers are reduced to a trickle. If the covenant assists one village by using their spell-like Drop of Spring Water of Aquam vis, other villages beseech the covenant for aid too. Do the characters turn the villagers away to face likely starvation and death, or do they expend their scarce resources to assist them with little prospect for any repayment from the essentially powerless peasants?

#### **The Power of Healing**

An advisor to a local lord has discovered the source of spell-like Yarrow of Corpus vis and has used it to convince his lord that he possesses great healing powers. If the characters harvest the vis, the advisor tracks them to their covenant and informs his lord of the theft.

#### **The Unquiet Dead**

A peasant finds spell-like Crystal of Imaginem vis and inadvertently turns himself invisible. He returns home and the village believes he has died and is haunting them. When he becomes visible again, the frightened villagers drive him from their homes. The peasant believes he has become the walking dead and travels to the covenant to serve his "dark masters," asking that he be laid to rest when his service is completed.

#### **The Immobile Redcap**

A greedy merchant attempts to cheat a minor faerie. The faerie leaves several coins out, including one of spell-like Silver Coin of Terram vis, and tells the merchant to take the one he's owed. But instead of taking the single coin himself, the merchant sends the covenant's Redcap to collect *all* of the coins as payment of his debt to the magi. The characters are expecting an important visit from the now-immobile Redcap and are forced to locate and free her. Should they track the coin to the faerie, he assists the characters in removing the curse, but only on the condition that they punish the merchant.

Arts for the dedicated vis. Each pawn of dedicated vis is treated as 2 pawns for determining the minimum number needed for the magus's Art total. To determine the Source Quality for the vis, the player first makes a stress die roll and adds the applicable aura bonus, and then the total is divided by 2; this number is the Source Quality for the Technique and Form of the dedicated vis. If the stress die double botches, the magus enters Wizard's Twilight. The number of botch dice equals double the number of pawns of dedicated vis studied.

A magus may study from dedicated and normal vis simultaneously. The magus must possess at least 1 pawn of dedicated vis for each pawn of normal vis used. The Source Quality is determined as normal and the total is divided by 2. In effect, the magus may study two Arts at once, but does so with only half the effectiveness of studying each Art separately.

#### **Enchantment Creation**

Dedicated vis also grants improved shape or material bonuses in the creation of magical devices. If the physical form of the dedicated vis is enchanted as a magical device, it gives double the normal shape and material bonus. Although the unmodified shape and material bonus may not exceed the magus' Magic Theory score, the modified bonus may. For example, 2 pawns of Corpus vis in the form of a human bone would grant double the shape and material bonus — +6 to destroy the human mind or +8 to destroy the human body — to any enchantment.

In addition, any vis contained in the physical object is considered already opened for enchantment purposes. In other words, a magus may reduce the amount of vis required to open the item for enchantment or add those pawns to the maximum capacity of the object. A small, bone object would normally require 6 pawns of vis to open it for enchantment. (See **ArM5**, page 97.) A magus with a small bone of dedicated vis containing 2 pawns of Corpus vis could choose to open the item with 4 pawns of additional vis for a capacity of 6 pawns, or the magus could select to use 6 pawns of additional vis to open the item and give it a capacity of 8 pawns of vis. (See *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, Ready-Opened Devices, page 41.) As noted above, transferring dedicated vis to a different object destroys all special effects the vis possesses.

![](_page_122_Picture_6.jpeg)

## *Vis Storage*

At the storyguide's option, any time a large amount of vis of a single Art is stored in close proximity, spontaneous Art-appropriate spells may occur. These effects make storing or transporting large quantities of vis difficult. The minimum amount of vis necessary to create the spontaneous spells is dependent on the saga type. In a low-vis saga, a rook or two (10 to 20 pawns) of vis may be sufficient; in a high-vis saga, at least a queen (100 pawns) of vis may be required for the effects to occur.

Because vis is the physical manifestation of magic, large quantities of it Warp the magical fabric nearby. This effect results in Art-appropriate spells spontaneously occurring near the vis, within what would be Voice range for a magus. The magnitude of the spell is determined by the amount of vis stored in the area. If the minimum amount of vis needed to create the spontaneous effects is stored, only first-magnitude spells occur. For every multiple beyond the minimum, an additional magnitude is added to the level of spells that may spontaneously occur. Thus, in a high-vis saga if the covenant stores 4 queens of Perdo vis in an area, random Perdo spells of level 20 or lower would occur spontaneously near the vis. When a large amount of vis is stored in an area, the storyguide should determine the Form or Technique of the spontaneous spell, or roll randomly among the Forms or Techniques, then select an effect using the spell guidelines detailed in **Ars Magica** Fifth Edition.

If this optional rule increases the amount of bookkeeping required for the covenant to an unacceptable level, the storyguide is free to ignore it. An alternate solution is to have the storyguide simply pick an interesting, but essentially harmless or useless, effect that occurs whenever a large quantity of Artspecific vis is stored in the same area. The following list provides some possibilities:

**Animal Vis:** Small animals, insects, and vermin spontaneously appear; animals gain body parts of other animals, for example rats grow wings; all vermin in the area die immediately.

**Aquam Vis:** The area is always damp and everything is covered in dew; all impurities are removed from water in the area, making it exceptionally pure and delicious.

**Auram Vis:** The area is shrouded in fog, and occasional showers fall in the room; ran-

![](_page_122_Picture_15.jpeg)

dom winds blow through the area, varying from gentle breezes to gusty winds.

**Corpus Vis:** Bruises and small scrapes or cuts instantly heal, and minor scars disappear; body hair grows at exceptional speed, several inches a day.

**Herbam Vis:** Long-dead wood in furniture and utensils sprouts branches and leaves; flowers and weeds grow through the cracks in the floor or wherever soil is present.

**Ignem Vis:** A hazy smoke fills the room; easily combustible objects may burst into flames; the area is heated as warm as a hot summer day.

**Imaginem Vis:** Everything tastes better and smells sweeter in the area; colors are brighter, sounds are more vivid, a mere whisper can be heard from the opposite side of the room.

**Mentem Vis:** Emotions run high in the area — sad people are thrown into deep depression and happy people become giddy with joy; people's subconscious thoughts are heard by everyone in the area, as if spoken aloud.

**Terram Vis:** Cracked pottery reforms; rusted blades become sharp again.

**Vim Vis:** Objects in the area are treated as if they had *Shell of False Determination* cast upon them, with the level of the effect being determined by the amount of vis nearby, and creatures suffer from *The Phantom Gift* if they stay too long.

**Creo Vis:** Worn or old items in the area become like new again; food lasts longer and rotten food becomes edible again.

**Intellego Vis:** All Perception rolls are improved by +3 in the area.

**Muto Vis:** Items nearby change color continuously; sounds change tenor and pitch unpredictably.

**Perdo Vis:** Objects near the vis age or deteriorate rapidly — wood rots, food spoils, and metal rusts.

**Rego Vis:** A character's ability to resist Personality Traits is increased by +1.

#### **Covenant Creation Costs**

The vis described above is more valuable than the typical forms of vis characters encounter. A vis source that provides extraordinary or dedicated vis should rarely produce more than a few such pawns per year. In transactions involving special vis, the vis is proportionally more valuable than normal vis. To determine the trade value of extraordinary or dedicated vis, divide its cost in Build Points by 5. If an extraordinary pawn of vis would require 20 build points, it is worth four times as much as a normal pawn of vis, which only requires 5 build Points.

**Lesser Enchantment Vis Source Cost: 5 Build Points + 0-2 Build Points per magnitude of the magical effect of the vis per pawn of vis per year**

**Spell-like Vis Source Cost: 5 Build Points + 1-3 Build Points per magnitude of the magical effect of the vis per pawn of vis per year**

**Dedicated Vis Source Cost: 7.5 Build Points per pawn of vis per year**

**Vis Stocks Cost: Vis Source Cost in Build Points divided by 5 per 5 pawns of vis**

The build points for extraordinary vis are variable depending on the special powers of the vis. Vis that mimics Ritual spells is more valuable than vis that simply mimics a normal spell, and vis that provides merely cosmetic or annoying effects should cost little or no more than normal vis.

#### **Insubstantial Vis**

Transferring special, dedicated, or unique vis from its native form to another shape destroys the special powers contained in the vis. Because of this, magi are often forced to carry insubstantial forms of vis in special containers. Auram vis could come in the form of a breeze, a scent, or fog — all of which can be held in a glass vial with cork or wax seal. The magus must break the vial or seal to use the vis. Similarly, vis can often be contained in sound or light. This vis is more difficult to transport. A magus needs to create a magical device to transport and store this insubstantial vis.

**Container for Ephemeral Vis** ReVi Level 24 Pen 0, 12/day R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

This device is an enchanted seashell. The holder may use it to capture or release insubstantial vis in auditory form 12 times per day. If the seashell contains insubstantial vis and is held to the ear, the sound of the vis may be heard. The same effect can also be enchanted into a crystal to retain luminescent vis. The more vis the device holds, the brighter it glows or louder it sounds.

(Effect: Base 10, +2 Voice; Modifications +4 12 uses per day)

## *Herbs and Objects of Virtue*

Many inanimate objects resonate with particular aspects of the Magic realm; this is the origin of the Shape and Material Bonuses employed by magi to enhance their enchantments. Some objects have become infused so greatly with the power of Magic that they transcend these bonuses, and can be coaxed into providing tangible powers by a skilled hedge magician.

Like Beasts of Virtue, it is hard to predict what forces result in a Thing of Virtue (that is, either a Herb or an Object of Virtue). More often than not, such things are found within a Magic aura, but not all plants within an aura are Herbs of Virtue. Those that are can be identified because they possess perfect symmetry, with no blemishes and the most vibrant of hues. Similarly, all Gemstones of Virtue are flawless, but not all flawless gemstones possess that perfect quality that makes one Virtuous. Perhaps the only reliable source of Objects of Virtue is the corpses of Beasts of Virtue; the vis in some of these creatures is concentrated in a particular body part, and manifests a particular power after suitable treatment from a hedge wizard. For example, the tongue of a Snake of Virtue can confer a magical ability to lie convincingly, and the mane of a Lion of Virtue makes one as brave as its original owner.

#### **Enriching a Thing of Virtue**

An Herb or Object of Virtue typically contains 1 or 2 pawns of vis. Without Enrichment, this, and any Shape and Material Bonus, is the only feature of such things. Anyone with the Magic Lore Ability can Enrich a Thing of Virtue, activating its hidden powers; the knowledge of what powers a Thing of Virtue might possess is covered by this Ability. To determine what powers a Thing of Virtue might have, make an Intelligence + Magic Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If successful, the character knows the magical powers that can be granted by the Thing of Virtue, and the method by which to Enrich it. Some Things of Virtue may have more than one possible Virtue; when Enriching such items, the magician must decide which power he wishes to activate. Once made, this decision cannot be undone.

Enrichment does not require a laboratory,

## *Hedge Magicians and Enriched Things of Virtue*

The mechanics of Enriching a Thing of Virtue allow an unGifted character to acquire minor magical powers. Such characters might actively seek out specific Herbs or Objects to perform their magic. They will never pose a threat to a Hermetic magus, however, and are largely ignored by the Order of Hermes. The archetypal village wise woman might gather Periwinkle of Virtue (which grants the Venus's Blessing virtue) as a love charm, or employ Vervain of Virtue (Enduring Constitution) and Heart's Ease of Virtue (granting Lesser Purifying Touch: Childbirth Fever) to assist childbirth. Likewise, a natural magician could Enrich a Topaz of Virtue to grant the Inspirational Virtue to his lord, or a Sapphire of Virtue (giving Intuition) to give a semblance of prediction to his astrological calculations. The Warping points incurred by these effects will gradually disfigure the wise woman or drive the natural magician mad with Flaws.

but a magical procedure is necessary; see the descriptions below for example Enrichments. Not all vis can be Enriched, only that which derives from an Animal, Herb, or Object of Virtue. Enrichment enchants the raw vis in the thing, and it cannot be henceforth used as vis or extracted from the object. This requires a season of uninterrupted magical operation and a sufficiently high Enrichment Total:

> **Enrichment Total: Intelligence + Magic Lore + aura**

> > **Enrichment Level: 9**

Anyone who carries a Thing of Virtue on his person acquires a Virtue from its magic, providing the character has no Magic Resistance. Things of Virtue can be carried across magical wards, but their powers are suppressed by an Aegis of the Hearth of any level. The item must remain intact and undamaged to confer its Virtue.

Herbs of Virtue typically lose their potency over time, persisting just one year for every pawn of vis in the original object, but they often confer a Major Virtue. Other Things of Virtue are usually more durable, and barring accidents do not fade in power with time, but they usually only confer a Minor Virtue. The Virtues conferred cannot affect the background of the character, story elements, or the gain of experience points (such as an Affinity), but could conceivably confer any other Virtue, including the new Virtues from Chapter 3: Magic Characters. A Supernatural Ability acquired in this way has a score of 3 and cannot be increased with experience points. When using a Enriched Thing of Virtue, it is as if the wearer has the Virtue; so, for example, Greater and Lesser Powers can be designed with Range Personal. Any Supernatural Ability or power granted by an Enriched Thing of Virtue can have a non-zero Penetration, but this affects the Ability or power used, not the item's ability to grant the power to its wearer. The Penetration Total is calculated in the usual way, as if the character had the Virtue or power in question (see **ArM5**, page 184 for the Penetration Total of Supernatural Abilities; and Chapter 4: Magic Characters, New and Modified Virtues for the Penetration Total of the Greater and Lesser Power Virtues).

There are downsides to Enriched Things of Virtue. Firstly, a Thing of Virtue that confers a Major Virtue also confers a Minor Flaw. Minor Virtues do not always incur a Flaw, but some do. The Hermetic Virtues of Restriction and Necessary Condition may be taken as Minor Flaws, affecting only the power granted by the Thing of Virtue. Thus a Herb that confers a Greater Immunity to Disease might also confer a Restriction that the immunity will not work if the wearer cuts or combs his hair. Secondly, an Enriched Thing of Virtue confers Warping points as a Constant Effect of Low Power (**ArM5**, page 168).

## *Herbs of Virtue*

Here follow some example Herbs of Virtue, and the benefits they offer once Enriched.

#### **Centaury**

Centaury of Virtue is used by witches to acquire the power of flight as a Greater Power. The leaves must be dried by moonlight, then steeped in strong liquor for a season. This must then be consumed in quantity until the imbiber can barely stand (intoxication is a Necessary Condition of this power), at which point the reveler and up to 12 others may take flight. All fliers must remain in close proximity, and must travel in the same direction. Everyone partaking in the herb loses one Fatigue level. Left unenriched, Centaury of Virtue is worth 2 pawns of Rego vis. ReCo 30 (base 15, +1 Conc, +2 Group): Greater Power (30 levels, –2 Might (fatigue) cost)

#### **Cinquefoil**

This pretty yellow flower with five petals as a Cinquefoil of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Mentem vis. It can be successfully Enriched by pressing it between two fine sheets of mica, then burying it in a tin box for a season. Then, whoever places it beneath his tongue will gain an abundance of eloquence, and the Inspirational Virtue.

## *Hermetic Magi and Enriched Things of Virtue*

A magus cannot usually benefit from an Enriched Thing of Virtue: even without his Parma Magica, his Forms give him a Magic Resistance of at least zero. Further, few magi have sufficient knowledge of non-Hermetic magic (that is, the Magic Lore Ability) to be able to effect an Enrichment. Nevertheless, some magi have found a use for Enriched Things of Virtue.

A magus can include the item in an enchanted item in the usual manner; thus, an Enriched Topaz of Virtue (see below) included in an invested item grants the wielder the Puissant Leadership Virtue as well as any Hermetic enchantments, as long as the wielder has no Magic Resistance. Enriching a Thing of Virtue does not affect its Shape and Material bonuses, but the inherent vis of the Thing of Virtue cannot contribute to the enchantment since it was used in the Enrichment process. An invested item made from an Enriched Thing of Virtue can only be made into a talisman if the magus Enriched the item himself. As a talisman, the Thing of Virtue ignores its owner's Magic Resistance, and is the only way that a magus can acquire the granted Virtue. A Thing of Virtue made into a talisman does not Warp its creator.

![](_page_125_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Fennel**

The Fennel of Virtue has a fleshy bulb and tall straight flower spikes bearing fragrant seeds. It contains 2 pawns of Vim vis. To be Enriched, a fennel must be plucked on a day sacred to St. Michael (or another mighty spirit of warlike mien), and wrapped in lamb's wool and snakeskin then kept in a scabbard for a season. The stalk of the fennel will become hard as wood, and when wielded as a wand it drives away evil spirits (a Greater Power). Any creature with an Infernal Might of 25 or less loses 5 points of Infernal Might, but each attack costs the wielder one Fatigue level. The owner must remain Continent (as per the Flaw) else its power will fade. PeVi (base 5, +1 Touch): Greater Power (10 levels, +35 Penetration, –1 Might (fatigue) cost)

#### **Mistletoe**

The parasitic Mistletoe of Virtue grants the power of prophecy. It must be cut from an apple tree without a single leaf touching the ground. The cut end is then bound against the flesh over the left breast and left covered for a season. The herb will reveal that it has successfully Enriched by taking root in the flesh of the wearer. The host of the plant gains the Supernatural Ability Divination & Augury (see *The Mysteries, Revised Edition*, pages 58–62). The method of divination granted is unique to the Mistletoe of Virtue; the diviner consumes the berries and receives mystical visions, granting ceremonial bonuses of Dreams +2, Herbam +5, and Intentions +1. The herb feeds directly from his heart's blood, granting a Fragile Constitution. After two years the plant will wither and die. Left unenriched, Mistletoe of Virtue is worth 2 pawns of Intellego vis.

#### **Pennyroyal**

The pennyroyal is a creeping plant similar to mint, with clusters of tiny purple flowers. The Pennyroyal of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Corpus vis. Known as Heal-All, the star that is ruling when this sovereign herb is Enriched determines which ailment it cures: Mars protects against flux; Venus against pox; Mercury against kidney stones; Jupiter against fever; and Saturn against falling sickness. The herb must be painted painstakingly with the clearest of resins from a lightning-struck pine; each week for a season a new layer of lacquer is added. A simple brush of the herb over the heart or brow will confer this Greater Purifying Touch. Let the healer be warned, however, for devils will seek to undo the work he has wrought with this herb (actually a Delusion).

#### **Periwinkle**

The intense blue of the Periwinkle of Virtue grants Venus's Blessing. The hopeful in love must find enough perfect flowers among those that have been trampled by rutting deer to form a garland, which is strung around the neck of the dominant stag. After ninety days, the sole remaining flower of this garland has been Enriched. The recovered garland also grants the impetuousness of youthful love that shows no inhibition in pursuing its object of affection (that is, the Reckless Flaw). Left unenriched, Periwinkle of Virtue is worth 1 pawn of Mentem vis.

## *Objects of Virtue*

The Virtues for many Objects of Virtue can be derived using Shape and Material Bonuses for inspiration, concentrating on materials rather than shapes. Any item that naturally contains vis and that gives a Shape and Material bonus to a specific Art can be Enriched to confer Puissant Art, but Objects of Virtue are rarely of use to magi because of their zero Penetration and the Warping they cause.

## *Shape and Material Bonuses for Herbs of Virtue*

**Centaury:** +3 Flight

**Cinquefoil:** +3 Leadership, +1 Rego Mentem

**Fennel:** +5 repel ghosts, +5 repel evil

spirits, +2 dreams

**Mistletoe:** +7 divination **Pennyroyal:** +3 healing

**Periwinkle:** +3 love, +1 loyalty or affection

## *Magic*

An Amethyst of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Mentem vis and, if appropriately Enriched, confers the Minor Supernatural Virtue Lesser Immunity to drunkenness (**ArM5**, page 44). To gain this benefit, the stone must be in contact with the drinker's skin, so it is usual to set it into an item of jewelry. The Enrichment ritual involves preparation of a beverage with no intoxicating effects from the strongest fermented drink available. Once the wizard is satisfied that the fluid is safe, probably by drinking quite a lot of it herself, the stone should be steeped in it for a month. The whole process of preparing the drink, testing it, and steeping the gem should take about a season.

#### **Bloodstone**

A suitably Enriched Bloodstone of Virtue gives the bearer the Minor General Virtue Rapid Convalescence (**ArM5**, page 48) as long as he is in contact with it and remains in bed, avoiding any mental or physical exertion. Enrichment requires that the stone be kept for at least a month in mud collected from a site known to have healing powers, followed by repeated washing in water gathered from a spring of proven curative power. Before Enrichment, the stone contains 1 pawn of Creo vis. The whole business of locating a source of suitable mud, collecting the water, and carrying out the processes should take about a season.

#### **Bufonites**

A Toad Stone of Bufonite of Virtue is a dull gray stone containing 2 pawns of Intellego vis that, when Enriched, has a Lesser Power to detect poison. It turns pink or dull red when in contact with poison.

Enrichment requires that the stone be removed from the head of a Toad of Virtue while it is still alive. The stone must then be placed on red cloth until it is set into a suitably fine item of personal jewelry or into a drinking vessel or platter. The whole process should take about a season. InAq 15 (base 3, +2 Sun, +1 Touch (Target), +1 continuous effect): Lesser Power (15 levels, –2 Might (fatigue) cost)

#### **Opal**

An Opal of Virtue contains 2 pawns of Terram vis. If suitably Enriched, it provides the Minor Heroic Virtue Sure Traveler (see *Houses of*  *Hermes, True Lineages*, page 107) but also produces a minor Personality Flaw. The Flaw should be chosen by the storyguide, in consultation with the player if appropriate, and might well be something that will irritate fellow travelers. Enrichment involves taking the item to the highest point in the vicinity, where the wizard has a clear view in all directions, for a season.

#### **Sapphire**

A Sapphire of Virtue, which contains 1 pawn of Intellego vis, can be Enriched to confer the Minor General Virtue Intuition (**ArM5**, page 44). It should be exposed to the light of a full moon over the course of a season, and kept wrapped in a piece of violet-colored fabric at all other times to effect and maintain the Enrichment. The user must gaze into the gem to gain the intuition, so it is usually set into a ring for convenience.

#### **Clam Shell**

The Clam Shell of Virtue, when Enriched, confers the Minor General Virtue Tough (**ArM5**, page 49). To benefit, the owner must wear or carry the shell. The Enrichment process could require that the shell be put in the torrent of a powerful waterfall for a season. A shell that survives the battering is proven Enriched. Before Enrichment, a Clam Shell of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Terram vis.

#### **Emerald**

If one places an Emerald of Virtue in the nest of a snake, and returns three months later to find the gem still there and so too the snake, it will have been Enriched. It then gives the bearer the Minor Supernatural Virtue Animal Ken (**ArM5**, page 40), with the restriction that it applies to serpents only. Before Enrichment, the gem contains 2 pawns of Animal vis.

#### **Jet**

An Enriched piece of Jet of Virtue provides the Minor General Virtue Puissant Stealth (**ArM5**, page 48). The Enrichment process involves leaving it concealed for a season in a place where people gather frequently, changing the hiding place once a month. The Virtue is lost if anyone other than the owner sees the jet. Before Enrichment, Jet of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Perdo vis.

#### **Topaz**

A Topaz of Virtue gives the Minor General Virtue Puissant Leadership (**ArM5**, page 48) after Enrichment. The procedure for Enrichment involves obtaining fur, feathers, or teeth from an animal known to be the leader of a pack or flock, then binding this to the stone using a gold-colored wire or thread and keeping the bundle in a high place for a season. Before Enrichment, the gem of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Mentem vis.

## *Formed Stones*

Some call these shaped stones lusus naturae — sports of nature — and say that they are formed in the soil by the creative force of vis plastica. Others say that shaped stones result from certain astral conjunctions, which fertilize the soil and rocks with vis formativa. Then there are those who claim they arise through the individualization of objects by a condensation of vapors liberated by fermentation in deeper-lying rocks. A few claim that they are reflections of ancient failures in creation.

#### **Clach Crubain**

There is a formed stone that is bent over, like a body crippled with the pains of arthritis, called Clach Crubain of Virtue. It contains 1 pawn of Perdo vis. When suitably Enriched, carrying the stone close to one's person confers the Minor Supernatural Virtue Lesser Immunity (arthritis) (**ArM5**, page 44).

The Enrichment process requires one to obtain a measure of pure oil, probably by crushing freshly picked, unblemished olives or by pressing oil-rich nuts. Alternatively, oil from an animal source may be used if the origins are special enough. The oil should be rubbed all over the stone and allowed to dry off in sunlight strong enough to warm the stone. The process must be repeated three times and should take about a season to complete.

#### **Ovum Anguinum**

A Serpent's Egg or Ovum Anguinum of Virtue is a pale, almost spherical formed stone with a regular pattern of small bumps on the surface. It can confer protection from poison and illness through the Minor General Virtue Improved Characteristics (Stamina +2) (**ArM5**, page 43). A variation

## *Shape and Material Bonuses for Objects of Virtue*

**Ovum Anguinum:** +2 versus infection and poison, +2 legal arguments, +2 resist

injury

**Thunderbolt:** +3 lightning, +2 Auram, +4 protection from demons

**Cornu Ammonis:** +3 affect visions, dreams

**Glossopetrae:** +5 resist snake venom **Fairy Loaves:** +4 keep milk fresh

in the Enrichment process can, alternatively, confer Improved Communication (+2) that helps the bearer to success in legal disputes and the like. Another variant bestows the Minor General Virtue Tough, giving +3 to Soak (**ArM5**, page 49). Before Enrichment, the stone contains 2 pawns of Creo vis.

The Enrichment process requires one to go at midsummer to a place where snakes gather and entwine about each other. As the snakes writhe, a ball of froth forms and rises up into the air. If one can leap up and catch this in a cloth before it falls to the ground, then carry it over a river that the snakes cannot swim, and keep the stone in the froth for a month, the process will be complete. Finding the right place to go and carrying out the process should take about a season.

#### **Thunderbolt**

Certain pointed stones called Thunderbolts of Virtue fall from the sky like darts during the most ferocious thunderstorms. Such a stone contains 1 pawn of Auram vis. A suitably Enriched one gives the person who carries it a Ward against Demons of the Air as a Greater Power, keeping out all such creatures with a Might of 10 or less. The stone must be held in the hand to work (a Necessary Condition).

The Enrichment process involves fastening it to a branch high up in a tree that has been struck by lightning, and leaving it there through three storms. It must be left for no less than three months, and for longer if storms are infrequent. ReAu 20 (base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 continuous effect): Greater Power (20 levels, +20 Penetration, –2 Might (fatigue) cost)

#### **Cornu Ammonis**

A Horn of Ammon or Cornu Ammonis of Virtue is a coiled stone like a petrified worm, containing yellow crystals or grains that look like gold. It carries 2 pawns of Intellego vis. According to Pliny, it can bring about prophetic visions in dreams. After appropriate Enrichment, it gives the Minor Supernatural Flaw Visions (**ArM5**, page 60) to anyone who sleeps with it under his head, perhaps under a pillow or some straw. The visions come as dreams.

Enrichment requires the drinking of a concoction of hallucinogenic fungi or herbs. While under the influence, the drinker learns of the location of a hibernating animal (e.g. a dormouse). The stone must be left in the animal's nest for the winter to activate its power.

#### **Glossopetrae**

A Stone Adder's Tongue or Glossopetrae of Virtue contains 1 pawn of Aquam vis and can be Enriched to become an antidote to liquid poisons. The poisoned character loses a Fatigue level rather than taking a wound. To be used, it must be put in the suspect liquid and left to stand for at least two Diameters. Enrichment involves the capture of a poisonous snake, which is milked for its venom. The stone is soaked in that venom for a month, then washed every night for another month in fresh clean rainwater that has been collected in a special bowl as it fell. The stone should be kept in snakeskin. PeAq 20 (base 10, +1 Touch, +1 Part): Lesser Power (20 levels, –1 Might (fatigue) cost)

#### **Fairy Loaves**

These formed stones called Fairy Loaves of Virtue are shaped like fairly flat round buns, and contain 1 pawn of Muto vis each. An Enriched stone of this type, if kept in the place where milk is stored, demonstrates a Lesser Power and keeps milk fresh. Enrichment involves a visit to a Faerie aura or negotiations with a minor faerie, taking about a season to conclude. MuAq 15 (base 2, +2 Sun, +2 Room, +1 constant effect): Lesser Power (15 levels, –2 Might (fatigue) cost).

![](_page_127_Picture_21.jpeg)

As discussed in Chapter 2: Auras, things inside a Magic aura are superior examples of their kind. All plants and trees are alive, and the plants and trees growing within Magic auras seem more alive than those in the mundane world. As noted in the spell description of *Stir the Slumbering Tree* (**ArM5**, page 137), most trees in Magic auras are awake — they're aware of their surroundings and capable of limited movement. The stronger the aura, the more alert and active the trees become. In an aura of level 6 or higher, the trees are fully awake and can see and hear about as well as a human can.

Awakened trees have no Might score and are not especially likely to contain vis. They possess Cunning rather than Intelligence. A mundane tree, transplanted into a sufficiently strong Magic aura, would eventually become Transformed. On the other hand, awakened trees become more lethargic whenever the Magic aura around them decreases.

Different varieties of trees have different personalities. Oak trees are steadfast and dignified, while more flexible trees such as willow or birch are more excitable and flighty. Awakened trees can talk to one another by rustling their leaves, spreading news on the wind.

#### **Animated Trees**

Certain spells or magical effects can take a tree beyond its ordinary awakened state and make it as mobile as an animal (albeit a sluggish one). Hermetic spells such as *Lord of the Trees* or *Calling the Council of the Trees* can have this effect, as can the non-Hermetic powers of many nature spirits (most often through the *Crafter of Herbam* power; see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Common Powers). A tree can also become animate when a spirit uses the *Manifestation* power (Chapter 8: Spirits, Common Powers of Spirits) to inhabit it. A tree animated by a spell or effect does not have a Might score, but one animated by *Manifestation* temporarily gains Might equal to the activation cost of the power.

## *Trees of Virtue*

Trees of Virtue are usually awake, but they have no Might score. They are more likely to be attended by Airy Spirits (see Chapter 7: Spirits, Florae and Faunae) than are other trees.

![](_page_127_Picture_29.jpeg)

The vis in a Tree of Virtue belongs to an Art associated with the tree's inherent magical powers, in a quantity usually between 1 and 3 pawns. Like herbs, Trees of Virtue may be Enriched to make magical charms or devices that grant Virtues. Unlike herbs, only a small portion of the tree is necessary to make this charm: the portion where all of the tree's inherent power resides. Enriching this item, or collecting the tree's vis, depletes the tree's magical powers. Sometimes a Tree of Virtue can replenish these

lost properties over time, but otherwise it becomes permanently non-magical. (Storyguides should decide whether a given Tree of Virtue is renewable or not based on the

Distinct from Trees of Virtue are trees that produce vis, but do not manifest their magical properties strongly enough to be eligible for Enrichment. Such trees may provide vis of the same Art as Trees of Virtue of the same species, or may simply yield Herbam vis. Vis-bearing trees usually (but do not always) replenish their vis after it has been harvested, making them a common vis source for covenants.

#### **Blackthorn**

needs of the saga.)

The blackthorn tree flowers in late winter or early spring, even before its leaves bud. Under the new moon while the tree is in flower, the thorns of a Blackthorn of Virtue may be Enriched by a magician who knows the proper lore. The wizard must find the 13 longest, sharpest thorns. She anoints each of these with a drop of human blood while they are still on the tree (usually the she simply pricks her own or an assistant's finger with each thorn) on several different nights, under different phases of the moon, while reciting the proper incantations.

When finished, the thorns may be used to inflict curses. They grant a power similar to the Virtue, Hex (see *Realms of Power: Infernal*, page 92) but with two limitations. First, the user can only curse a victim to whom she has an Arcane Connection: she must fashion a wax figure of the target and pierce it with an Enriched thorn. Second, each of the 13 thorns can be used only once. (Together, these limitations constitute a Restriction). Note that the Hex power granted by Blackthorn of Virtue is aligned with the Magic Realm, not the Infernal.

Alternatively, a Blackthorn of Virtue may simply be harvested for 2 pawns of Perdo vis.

## *Option: Brawl Skill for Animated Trees*

For simplicity, troupes can simply assign a default Brawl skill of 3 (specialized in "branch") to all animate trees. A more complex alternative is to assign a different Brawl skill to each tree and re-calculate its combat statistics accordingly.

Under this rule, a tree animated by a spell has a Brawl skill equal to the caster's Finesse. A tree animated by a spirit using Manifestation has the same Brawl skill as the spirit, and uses the spirit's Dexterity and mental Characteristics (but the tree's Strength, Stamina, and Quickness).

#### **Hazel**

On a Hazel Tree of Virtue, one supple branch is forked with perfect symmetry. A magician can Enrich this branch into a wand that provides the Virtue Dowsing (see **ArM5**, page 41). The branch must be fashioned into a forked wand and then buried and dug up seven different times, each at a different place of mystical significance (such as at a crossroads, next to an ancient megalith, at a spring with healing powers, and so on). The wand must be left in each place for at least seven days. Before Enrichment, the symmetrical branch contains 1 pawn of Intellego vis.

## *Story Seed: War for the Woods*

As the covenant begins to harvest too much vis from a magical forest, the trees and forest spirits notice a slight weakening of the local aura and take exception to the magi's activities. The trees begin to awaken on their own and hinder travelers in various ways: lowering their branches to block trails, placing their roots where passers-by will trip over them, and so forth. If the magi escalate the conflict by using axes or fire, the Florae or genius loci protecting the forest animate the trees in self-defense.

#### **Oak**

Oak is associated with storms and lightning. Wood from the heart of an Oak of Virtue may be fashioned into an item that grants a Lesser Immunity to lightning, after it is properly Enriched. The Enrichment process involves seasoning the wood while exposing it to incense and the smoke of burning herbs over the course of a season. At least once during this process the wood must be brought under the open sky while lightning is flashing. The finished, Enriched item may be carved into any shape or size (limited only by the size of the original tree). If it is a

**Natural Weapons:** The weapon statistics for this tree's branch are Init +10, Atk +4, Dfn +2, Dam +2. This makes its combat statistics work out exactly as listed in the spell *Lord of the Trees* (**ArM5**, page 139), when combined with its Brawl skill of 3.

**Vis:** None

These statistics should be used for trees affected by spells such as *Lord of the Trees* or *Calling the Council of the Trees* (**ArM5**, page 139), or those animated by spirits. Under most circumstances, an animate tree has no Might score.

An animate tree can move its limbs and roots, and can also uproot itself and shuffle about if the spell description says it can. For this purpose, treat *Manifestation* as equivalent to the spell, *Freeing the Striding Tree* (**ArM5**, page 139).

## *Character Guide: A Mandrake Root of Virtue*

**Magic Might:** 5

**Characteristics::** Cun +1, Per 0, Pre –3, Com 0, Str –10, Sta +3, Dex 0, Qik +6

**Size:** –6

**Season:** Spring

**Virtues and Flaws:** Magic Thing; Arcane Lore; Restricted Power, Weak Characteristics

**Magic Qualities and Inferiorities:** Greater Power, Improved Powers (x2)

**Personality Traits:** Mandrake\* +3, Spiteful +1

**Combat:**

*Dodge:* Init +6, Attack N/A, Defense +9, Damage N/A

**Fatigue Levels:** n/a

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1), –3 (2), –5 (3), Incapacitated (4), Dead (5+)

**Abilities:** Brawl 2 (dodging), Penetration 4 (scream)

**Powers:**

*Deadly Scream*, 0 points, Init +6, Corpus or Animal

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Sound

The mandrake root's scream is deadly to all who hear it (deafness is an effective defense). It can only use this power at the moment it is pulled out of the soil.

PeCo(An) 50 (Base 30, +3 Sound, +1 Animal Requisite): Greater Power (50 levels), Improved Powers x2 (+1 Initiative, –5 Might cost)

**Vis:** 5 Corpus; this is spell-like vis that cures a Medium or lesser wound due to poison or disease (but not injury).

**Appearance:** The above-ground part of a mandrake plant looks like a cluster of oblong, tapered leaves growing close to the earth. It somewhat resembles a tobacco plant, though tobacco does not exist in Mythic Europe. The root is about six inches long, fleshy, and has five lobes. It vaguely resembles a human figure with head, arms, and legs. Wrinkles and lumps on the uppermost lobe suggest a human face.

Mandrake of Virtue can be found beneath hangman's trees (provided the tree is within a Magic aura or, at least, outside the Dominion). When a man is hanged, his semen is released and spills onto the earth. Mandrake of Virtue sometimes springs from this seed.

Mandrake root can be Enriched by a hedge wizard into a Thing of Virtue. This involves burying it under a mound of horse manure for a season, digging it up frequently to feed the root with blood, milk, and honey. After this process, the root becomes semi-animate, able to creep slowly about (one foot per minute). Its twitching and writhing can be interpreted to foretell the future, as well. Treat this as the Premonitions Virtue (the Enriched root grants the Ability Premonitions 3). The Enriched mandrake root must be fed blood in order to use this power (a Necessary Condition), but the blood need not be human.

Mandrake has many other uses. It can be used to make a potent aphrodisiac and is a cure for many physical ailments. Some hedge wizards know the secret of converting a mandrake root into a kind of homunculus, which they use as Hermetic magi use familiars. This knowledge is obscure, but not totally unknown within the Order. It may require a story to find the correct magical process, or, if the storyguide prefers, she can allow a magus to simply bond the mandrake root as if it were an animal. At the end of the bonding process, the mandrake root looks like a little man about six inches high. Some wizards even provide their mandrakes with tiny clothes.

Mandrake root screams when pulled from the ground; its scream is deadly to all who hear it. Hedge wizards usually employ a trick whereby they tie a hungry dog to the mandrake root. When the dog goes to sleep they bring some meat to just outside the reach of the rope and then hastily withdraw. When the dog awakens and lunges for the meat, the mandrake is uprooted. More enlightened magicians, including most Hermetic magi, simply use deaf servants to harvest mandrake root. Magi, of course, can use spells to render a person temporarily deaf.

A mandrake root that is Enriched (but not one that is bonded as a homunculus) does not serve willingly and will try to cause mischief when it can.

![](_page_129_Picture_28.jpeg)

Before Enrichment, the heartwood of an Oak of Virtue contains 2 pawns of Auram vis.

#### **Rowan**

From a Rowan of Virtue, a magician can make a protective amulet. The red berries of the rowan are marked with a five-pointed star; proper Enrichment of the amulet requires selecting only the berries that have perfect stars. The magician crushes a few of these berries along with certain herbs (basil and rue, among others) and pure rain water, and in this brew steeps two twigs from the same tree as the berries. Fresh berries (only those with perfect stars) and herbs must be added each day from one quarter-day (solstice or equinox) till the next. The two redstained twigs are then tied with red thread into an equal-armed cross.

The finished amulet grants a Lesser Magic Power Virtue (see Chapter 4: Magical Characters, New Virtues). Its effect is identical to a Hermetic Rego Vim ward (see **ArM5**, page 161) of Level 10 and Penetration 10, with a Target: Individual rather than Circle, that wards its bearer against creatures of one supernatural Realm (Magic, Infernal, or Faerie, but not Divine — the Realm must be chosen by the magician when the amulet is made). The amulet loses its power after seven years.

## *Awakened Items*

Magical devices can occasionally become magic things, perhaps because of a laboratory accident or exposure to the Magic Realm. Here is one example of an enchanted item that has been awakened by magic.

*Whiten the Wear of Travel*, 0 points, Init –1, Animal and Terram

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind

When activated, all dirt and travel stains are removed from the cloak, and any small rips and tears (anything smaller than a Light Wound) are instantly mended.

Cr(Pe)An(Te) 20 (base 15, +1 requisite): Lesser Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost), mastery point from *Cloak of the Duck's Feathers* (–1 Might cost)

*The Woolen Cloud*, 0 points, Init –1, Animal and Corpus

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind

For the duration, Amiculum can float upon the air and move slowly in any direction. While floating, it can support the weight of up to two human beings.

ReAn(Co) 20 (base 5, +1 Conc, +1 size, +1 requisite): Lesser Power (20 levels, –1 Might cost), mastery point from *Cloak of the Duck's Feathers* (–1 Might cost)

#### **Vis:** 1 Animal

**Appearance:** Amiculum is a white woolen cloak with two sides; an intricate circle of red, green, and black is woven on the inside, which is large enough to surround a man who stands upon it.

Amiculum was enchanted as a talisman for its master, a Hermetic magus known for his interest in chivalry and courtly love. When he went into Twilight, his talisman went with him and returned from the experience as an independent magical being. Because of this connection, it can affect its master with its powers as itself and does not need to penetrate his Parma Magica. As a cloak, it is mostly concerned about remaining clean and pure, and protecting its master against harm. While it understands a great deal of its master's Latin and could converse with him, it chooses instead to remain silent so not to embarrass itself. Likewise, it is very conscious of keeping its place, and does not like to exercise its ability to move and to carry things.

## *Kelpie*

Kelpies are carnivorous magical creatures that live at the bottom of deep fresh-water pools. Their natural form is a writhing mass of oily black tentacles and sharp beaks that are capable of piercing the thickest amor, but kelpies also have the curious ability to transform into sleek, black horses. In this form, the kelpie-stallion exudes a musky charisma, allowing it to befriend other horses; it leads them to the edge of the pool where they are rapaciously devoured. Another favorite hunting technique of those kelpies that live near a road is to seek out weary travelers,

## *Story Seed: The Mandrake's Scream*

A hangman's tree stands in a weak Magic aura at a crossroads near the covenant. One can occasionally find a Mandrake of Virtue growing under it. The court physician to an ailing nobleman has harvested a mandrake to cure his lord, but, tragically, the noble's curious son secretly followed the physician and watched too closely — he was killed by the mandrake's scream. The player characters might be called in to investigate the boy's disappearance, or the physician might come to them asking for help.

who it will entice into riding. Once the traveler is mounted, the kelpie dashes headlong into its pool — drowning and then consuming the rider.

It is possible to tame and train a kelpie to serve as a fearsome mount — or even a beast of burden — and some magi have done so. A kelpie mount has an independent Magic

Resistance, does not tire easily, is very swift, and looks impressive but not overtly magical — in stallion form, at least. A trained kelpie can understand simple verbal instructions, including when to change form, and can also be ridden when in stallion form, using the

Ride Ability. A kelpie is a magical thing, so it must rest in a magic aura (usually a pool) in order to restore its Might Pool.

The kelpie described here is a magical creature associated with deep pools. However, similar faerie creatures may exist.

*Kick:* Init –1, Attack +8, Defense +6, Damage +7

**Soak:** +11

**Fatigue Levels:** n/a.

**Wound Penalties**: –1 (1-8), –3 (9-16), –5 (17-24), Incapacitated (25-32), Dead (33+)

**Abilities:** (Area) Lore 2 (roads), Athletics 5 (galloping), Awareness 3 (roads), Brawl 5 (bite), Charm 3 (travelers), Hunt 5 (tracking), Stealth 3 (at night), Swim 3 (ambush)

**Powers:**

*Equine metamorphosis*, 3 points, Init –5,

Aquam

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

The kelpie ejects itself from its pool and in mid-flight the mass of slimy tentacles transforms into a glistening black stallion. The kelpie may at will return to its native form without an additional expenditure of Might, but if the kelpie is completely saturated with water while in its stallion form, a Stamina Roll against an Ease Factor of 9 must be made, otherwise it reverts to its native form.

MuAq(An) 25 (Base 10, +2 Sun, + 1 Complex effect): Lesser Power (25 levels)

*Equine charisma*, 2 points, Init –7, Imaginem R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind

The kelpie makes itself alluring to its victim. This is automatically successful if the victim has a Cunning characteristic, but if the victim has an Intelligence characteristic then an Intelligence Roll against an Ease Factor of 9 will resist the effect (penalties for Fatigue apply, which makes weary travelers particularly susceptible). A victim with Cunning will follow the lead of a kelpie that it finds alluring, while an Intelligent victim will usually attempt to ride or capture the kelpie. This power may only be used while the kelpie is in stallion form.

CrIm 40 (Base 5, +3 Sight, +2 Sun, +2 Complex effect): Greater Power (40 levels, –2 cost)

*Fleet of Foot*, 0 points, Constant, Animal:

R: Per, D: Constant, T: Ind

When in its stallion form, the kelpie can travel at about three times the speed of a normal horse (it can carry a rider about 100 miles in a day).

MuAn 15 (Base 4, +2 Sun, +1 Constant effect): Lesser Power (15 levels, –2 cost)

**Equipment:** None.

**Encumbrance:** 0

**Vis:** 4 pawns of Aquam in the blood of the kelpie.

**Appearance:** In native form the kelpie is a black, amorphous, and distended mass covered with an array of muscular tentacles, mouths, beaks, and sensory organs. It usually dwells at the bottom of a deep, shaded pool. In stallion form the kelpie appears to be a large, powerful, black horse as might be ridden into battle by a wealthy knight.

A clan chief in the Scottish Highlands approaches the covenant wanting to commission the manufacture of a magical bridle that will allow him to capture and break a local kelpie (this could be achieved with a ReAn effect). The chieftain intends to use the kelpie to drag heavy stones to the site of a new fortress. The rapid construction of the fortress, aided by the labor of the kelpie, will tip the balance of power among the Highland clans — so, assisting the chieftain could be construed as interference in the mundane and hence a possible breach of the Peripheral Code.

## *Elementals*

Elementals are magical creatures composed of very pure elemental matter. They are not truly alive, and are capable of neither growth nor reproduction. Instead, they form from pure physical matter under some magical impetus, such as a Magic aura. Nothing that is or has been alive can generate an elemental, nor can matter that is no longer in a raw state, but which has been moved, cut, or otherwise interfered with by a living being.

The process of forming an elemental is called **rarefication**. This process causes atoms of matter to take on a pseudo-life of their own, freeing themselves from the atoms of other elements and self-organizing into an elemental. Usually only one elemental forms, of a maximum size determined by the amount of matter present. Magi of the Order know spells that can catalyze this process, but they may also create elementals by accident with careless use of elemental magic (see below for more details). Further, raw elemental matter possessing a Warping Score of 5 may spontaneously rarefy into an elemental; for example, a natural spring within a Magic Aura of 6 might generate a water elemental after 75 years. However, not all Warped matter develops an elemental, and this process is little understood by those who have studied it.

Once rarefied, the elemental exists until it is destroyed; elementals do not age, they have no need for nutrition, and do not succumb to disease. They suffer from

![](_page_131_Picture_45.jpeg)

![](_page_132_Picture_1.jpeg)

impulses that drive them to certain actions based on their elemental make-up, but they possess no capacity for thought in the traditional sense.

## *Magic and Elementals*

Some magi who are skilled in elemental magic routinely create and bind elementals to their bidding, but the primitive sentience of these beings, combined with the difficulty in obtaining the appropriate raw materials and vis required, means that most do not bother. Ritual Creo spells can create elementals, and they may be controlled using Rego magic. New guidelines for these effects are given in the nearby insert. In addition, standard Rego guidelines may also create wards (or prisons) for elementals with spells that affect creatures from the Magic Realm, and Perdo Vim spells can destroy the Magic Might that animates their simple bodies.

Other spells involving the elemental Forms may accidentally cause an elemental to rarefy, if cast on sufficiently pure matter that is already substantially Warped, such as that found within a Magic aura. The production of an elemental is a potential consequence of any botched spell or lab activity involving an elemental Form while in a Magic aura. Similarly, magic used to purify an element can have a similar effect — more than one Flambeau magus has tried to make his flames hotter, and accidentally rarefied a fire elemental.

## *New Elementals Spells and Spell Guidelines*

**Creo (elemental Form)**

**Level 25:** Create an elemental from a base amount of elemental matter (Ritual)

#### **Muto (elemental Form)**

**General:** Convert part of an elemental's body into another type of matter of the same element (soil to dust, wind to smoke, etc.), reducing the elemental's Might pool by the level of the spell +10. If the elemental is not destroyed by this effect, when the duration ends it can restore this Might by re-absorbing the matter.

#### **Rego (elemental Form)**

**Level 5:** Completely control an elemental

#### **Perdo (elemental Form)**

**General:** Destroy sufficient matter to reduce an elemental's Might Score by the level of the spell +10

#### **New Elementals Spells**

**Rarefy the Crude Water** Creo Aquam 30 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual This ritual spell rarefies a base amount of water (up to a pool of 5 paces diameter and 2 paces deep) to bring a water elemental into existence. At its maximum size, the elemental has a Might of 15 and a Size of 0, but smaller bodies of water will yield smaller elementals. The character guides given later in the chapter describe typical elementals created by this spell. For larger (and thus more powerful) elementals, this spell must be invented with a Size modifier to the target, with each application of the modifier giving +3 Size. Since Size determines Might (see later), 1 extra size magnitude gives an elemental a Might of 20 (Size +3), 2 a Might of 25 (Size +6), etc. This spell doesn't need to penetrate the Might of the elemental instantiated; until the completion of the spell, the elemental doesn't exist.

(base 25, +1 Touch)

#### **Command the Living Fire**

Rego Ignem 20

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

This spell allows the caster to control the actions of a fire elemental up to Size 0, if the Penetration Total exceeds the elemental's Magic Might. For larger elementals, versions of the spell with a Size modifier to the Target are required. If an elemental is already under supernatural control, the most recent spell or power used is the one that commands it.

(base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)

## *A Digression into Physics*

The universe is made up of building blocks called **atoms** (from *atomas*, meaning "uncuttable"). There are four varieties of atoms, and each atom possesses two qualities that govern its nature: earth is cold and dry; water is cold and moist; air is hot and moist; and fire is hot and dry. The **corpuscles** of atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter, and have size, shape, and color. Corpuscles of earth are cubes, those of water are icosahedrons (shaped like a 20-sided die), air corpuscles are octahedrons (an eight-sided die), and fire corpuscles are tetrahedrons (a four-sided die or pyramid). The size of the corpuscles determine the type of matter that it forms. Small tetrahedral corpuscles make up the

fine blue fire that gives the sky its color; whereas large smoky flames are made from the largest corpuscles of fire. Air that is thin and pure is formed from small octahedra; whereas mist is made from large, dense octahedra. Oil receives its thickness from its large corpuscles of water; but very fine atoms make up volatile liquids like spirit of wine. Rock is made of large and heavy corpuscles; whereas sand is made of much finer cubes.

The moist quality causes a thing to adapt to its external conditions, whereas dryness causes a thing to define its own shape and bounds. As a consequence, moist things tend to be volatile and expansive, since they can fill spaces in their surroundings, whereas dry things are fixed and structured. Hotness causes matter to separate and seek those of its own kind, but coldness promotes mixing of matter and coagulation. The world is formed of four regions of elemental matter, with the self-defining dry elements forming the innermost layer of earth and the outermost layer of fire. The two cold elements sink to the center of the earth whereas the two hot ones seek to separate and rise, leaving the final order, from the center, as earth, water, air, and fire. Beyond the region of fire is the Lunar Sphere, which separates the material and the celestial realms. More details on this issue can be found in *Art & Academe*.

Elementals are simple beings, and their game statistics are similarly simple. The method below is primarily targeted at creating elementals as described in this chapter — non-sentient entities that rarefy from raw elemental matter under the influence of magic. However, the general principles can be applied to use an elemental as the starting point for a magic character. In this latter case, follow the procedure detailed in Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Magic Things, using the details here for guidance. Alternatively, the character guides given below can be easily updated for larger or smaller elementals with just a few changes.

**Inherited Virtues**: Magic Thing; Ways of the (Land)

**Inherited Flaws**: Poor Memory, Short Attention Span, Simple Minded

#### **Concept**

An elemental is a Magic Thing rather than a creature — it is a collection of pure elemental matter animated by magic. The amount of elemental matter that constitutes the elemental determines its Size, and the type of elemental matter determines its Characteristics. Dryness is associated with Dexterity and Quickness, Coldness with Strength and Stamina, Moisture with Cunning and Perception, and Heat with Presence and Communication. Thus Earth elementals, which are dry and cold, are the most physical of all elementals, whereas air elementals are the most ephemeral, being predominantly moist and warm. Elementals are not sentient beings; their capacity to pursue their base drives and needs is represented by a Cunning score. The Communication of an elemental represents how willing it is to relay information it has gathered, although magic is required to understand it (using spells such as *Words of the Flickering Flame* or *Voice of the Lake*). Hot elementals will chatter everything that they sense, whereas cold elementals are taciturn and silent. Elementals do not have senses in the same manner as living beings, but they can sense perturbations in their own element. Thus a fire elemental can sense the heat in living beings just as a water elemental feels the liquid in them, while an earth elemental picks up the vibrations of their footsteps. An air elemental, the most perceptive of all, senses the eddies of air generated whenever a creature moves, and interprets sounds with accuracy.

Like other characters, elementals have 7 points to spend on Characteristics; however, they typically have a large proportion of Magical Qualities that affect their Characteristic scores. Most elementals have one Characteristic that is very high, one that is moderately high, one that is moderately poor, and one that is exceptionally poor. The actual scores in these Characteristics is related to their Might; typical values for the eight characteristics have been tabulated for a range of Might scores. The positive scores have been purchased with Magical Qualities that are exactly matched by Magical Inferiorities for the negative scores, so have a net cost of zero.

The scores can be assigned to the Characteristics as desired, except that each type of elemental has some characteristics that cannot take a negative value:

| Element N | o Negative Scores  |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Earth     | Str, Sta, Dex, Qik |
| Water     | Str, Sta, Cun, Per |
| Air       | Cun, Per, Pre, Com |
| Fire      | Pre, Com, Dex, Qik |

Following assigning the characteristics, make the usual adjustment from Size, subtracting Size from Quickness and adding twice Size to Strength.

All elementals have an intuitive understanding of the environment that spawned them, which amounts to the Ways of the (Land) Virtue. Since they are neither alive nor truly sentient, they also suffer from the Poor Memory, Short Attention Span, and Simple-Minded Flaws.

## *Elemental Story Seeds*

#### **The Forgotten Child**

A magus uses *Incantation of Lightning* (or a similar spell of 6th magnitude or greater) in a Magic aura, which inflicts the last Warping point needed to rarefy an elemental. Unaware of what he's done, he moves on. The elemental he has unwittingly created causes no end of trouble for the locals. Eventually the magus discovers his error, and must put right what he has wrought.

#### **The Unforgiving Sea**

Concerned that a colleague has not been heard from for a while, the player magi are dispatched to see if anything is wrong. The magus — an expert in Aquam — discovered a way to increase the Might (and size) of his pet water elemental, using raw Aquam vis that he transferred (**ArM5**, page 94) into a sufficient quantity of pure elemental matter. The infused water was then absorbed by the elemental as the magus cast a Creo Aquam spell (with a Vim requisite) of his own devising. Unfortunately for the magus, the elemental became too powerful for him to control, and he is now trapped in his sanctum. Alternatively, the characters may just come across his shattered laboratory and his lab texts, and not realize the danger involved in re-creating his work.

#### **Lunchtime in the Vis Stores**

The characters discover some Terram vis in a patch of clay lying in a region with no mystical aura. They take it home to their covenant and put it in their vis stores. Now that it is in a Magic aura, the elemental can start to recover its exhausted Might pool, and it consumes the magi's other Terram vis to make itself larger. When the characters next visit their vis stores, they are in for a surprise.

#### **Season and Abilities**

Elementals are almost always Spring characters, newly created and naïve to the world. All elementals have Brawl and Athletics (or, for water elementals, Swim), which must be bought at a score equal to the magnitude of the elemental's Might with the character's starting experience points. If there are insufficient experience points to purchase these Abilities at the required level, then the character must purchase Improved Abilities as a Minor Magical Quality sufficient times to make up the difference. There are few other Abilities that are suitable for elementals, although Area Lore, Awareness, Hunt, and Penetration are often possessed to some level.

![](_page_133_Picture_23.jpeg)

![](_page_134_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Might and Qualities**

An elemental's Might is determined solely by the size of the concretion of pure elemental matter from which it forms. One rarefied from a mountain will have a vast Might score, whereas one coming from a single flame will be as weak as possible. An elemental with a Might of 1 is a mere handful of atoms at Size –18: a lick of flame, a drop of water, a puff of air, or a pebble. Every increase in magnitude of Might (as if it were a spell) adds three to the Size. Thus an elemental of Might 2 is Size –15, one of Might 5 is Size –6, and one of Might 15 is Size 0. Powerful elementals get big very quickly: an elemental with a Magic Might of 30 is bigger than a whale! Once the Might of the character has been decided, the Size of the character can be derived from the nearby table; elemental characters do not need to buy Magical Qualities or Inferiorities to get to this Size. All elementals have the No Fatigue Magical Quality and the Temporary Might Magical Inferiority like other Magic Things, but these do not count towards their normal allocation of Qualities and Inferiorities.

All elementals have one obligatory Greater Power (*Crush*, *Drown*, *Suffocate*, or *Burn* for Earth, Water, Air, and Fire elementals respectively). Elementals cannot use weapons or armor, and their natural attacks have no modifiers to their combat totals unless Magical Qualities have been purchased.

#### **Elemental Combat**

Elementals are not living, thus they cannot suffer wounds; instead, each blow separates some of their substance from their animating force. In practice, this works the same as inflicting wounds on a living creature, but each wound also reduces the elemental's Might Pool by a number of points equal to the Wound Penalty. An Incapacitating Wound removes 5 Might points, just like a Heavy Wound. The elemental's Might score does not change, so there is no need to recalculate Size following a wound.

An elemental that is reduced to a Might pool of zero suffers the usual effects of this state (see Chapter 4: Magic Characters, Incapacitation and Exhausted Might). However, an elemental additionally loses its animating force and becomes inanimate. In this state it can easily be mistaken for raw vis. As soon as the elemental regenerates

## *Size, Might, and Characteristics of Elementals*

Like other Magic Things (see Chapter 3: Magic Characters), the Size of an elemental is dependent on the Might chosen for it, and is not purchased with Magical Qualities or Inferiorities. The Might of an elemental also determines its typical Characteristics. The table below indicates values for the eight Characteristics at different Might scores. Each of these sets of Characteristics has been purchased with Magical Qualities and Inferiorities that exactly cancel out, resulting in a zero overall cost.

| Might S | ize C | haracteristics                  |
|---------|-------|---------------------------------|
| 1       | –18   | +2, +2, +1, +1, +1, 0, –1, –1   |
| 5       | –6    | +3, +2, +1, +1, 0, 0, –1, –2    |
| 10      | –3    | +3, +3, +1, +1, 0, 0, –1, –3    |
| 15      | 0     | +4, +3, +2, +1, 0, 0, –2, –4    |
| 20      | +3    | +6, +5, +2, +2, +1, 0, –5, –6   |
| 25      | +6    | +7, +6, +2, +2, +1, 0, –6, –7   |
| 30      | +9    | +8, +6, +2, +2, +1, 0, –6, –8   |
| 35      | +12   | +9, +7, +2, +2,+1, 0, –7, –9    |
| 40      | +15   | +10, +8, +2, +2, +1, 0, –8, –10 |
| 45      | +18   | +11, +9, +2, +2, +1, 0, –9, –11 |
| 50      | +21   | +12, +9, +2, +2, +1, 0, –9, –12 |
|         |       |                                 |

a point of Might pool it can move again, but since all elementals have the Temporary Might Inferiority they have difficulty recovering Might. An elemental could remain dormant for many years before the presence of the correct flavor of vis brings it back to pseudo-life.

The pieces of the elemental's body broken off during physical combat contain vis; see Chapter 3: Magic Characters, Magical Inferiorities, Temporary Might for more details. This vis is easily collected for water and earth elementals, less so for air and fire elementals. This vis can be used by a magus to power spells before the elemental is destroyed, although it is often difficult to collect it in the middle of a fight. In addition, the elemental instinctively tries to reunite its matter with itself, and may well manage to re-absorb the vis and replenish its Might pool. If an elemental is damaged by destroying its matter — using Perdo (Form) or Perdo Vim spells, or water against a fire elemental, for example — then the vis is also destroyed.

#### **Elemental Powers**

All elementals have a power that results from the elemental matter from which their bodies are made, and a power that describes their natural method of attack. Magic Resistance can prevent the elemental from touching its opponent, but the elemental does not need to spend Might points for this attack. Most elementals have at least one other power. This power should be strongly tied to the type and origin of the magical entity. Typical powers are listed with the descriptions of the elementals.

## *Earth Elementals*

The earth elementals are known to the Order as **genomi** (singular genomus, meaning "earth-living"), but they go by a number of other names including gnomes (contracted from their Hermetic name), pygmaei, and telluri. They may be rarefied from any large concretion of earth that has not been worked by human hands, such as untilled soil, natural rock features, and naturally occurring nuggets of metal. It is no harder to rarefy a genomus from soil than it is from metal, but the quantity of raw material available limits the size of the elemental created — a gold nugget of Size –10 can only produce an elemental with Might 3. Genomi are extraordinarily long-lived, and are as durable as the substance from which they are formed. They are patient predators, driven by an unslakable thirst to extract the delicious moisture from living beings. They are fiercely territorial, and will attack any being who intrudes upon their defined space; thus genomi make excellent guards — most attacks from a genomus result from having stood upon one!

An earth elemental appears much like any other object of earth or rock, except it is made up of sharp edges and right-angled corners that form cubic corpuscles of different sizes. Earth elementals move by sliding these cubic components around in endless cycles; this appears awkward and laborious in hard-bodied genomi, but can be hypnotically smooth in those made of sand or soil. Genomi are exceptionally strong and remarkably fast. An earth elemental made from a hard substance attacks by bludgeoning its prey with its stone limbs. Softer genomi of sand and soil will engulf their prey first by making a grapple attack, and then crush the immobilized target within their bodies.

![](_page_134_Picture_18.jpeg)

A Size 0 earth elemental is a boulder about one pace in diameter. A Size +9 genomus is as tall as a small cliff; whereas a Size +15 genomus is the size of a hill. The elemental's body is composed entirely of soil, sand, or rock. It can match a walking man for speed, and overtake a running horse when tumbling downhill. Only bludgeoning weapons such as hammers, maces, or axes can damage an earth elemental; piercing or slashing weapons will merely plunge into the body of a soil elemental or glance off the surface of a rock elemental. Spades and picks are also effective weapons.

#### **Sample Powers**

All earth elementals have this power:

#### **Crush**

0 points, Init equal to (Qik–2), Terram R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

The elemental clubs at an opponent with its heavy limbs, requiring a normal melee attack. If the elemental is at least equal in Size to its opponent, a successful Crush attack can pin him to the ground, and the elemental adds its (Might/5, rounded up) to its Grapple Strength to prevent its victim escaping (**ArM5**, page 174). If the elemental successfully grapples, then any equipment carried by its victim is damaged; fragile items are destroyed, robust items are broken (and are destroyed if affected again by this power), and metal items are damaged (and are broken if affected again by this power).

Re(Pe)Te 30 (base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 affect stone, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect): Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +1 Init)

Some earth elementals have the following powers. Other powers typically mimic Terram spells, particularly Rego Terram spells.

#### **The Red Touch**

1 point, Init equal to (Qik + 5), Terram R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The touch of the elemental can rust metal; every time it is struck in combat by a metal object, or successfully strikes a being with metal armor, it can convert that metal into a thoroughly rusted object that will crumble to dust.

PeTe 10 (base 3, +1 Touch, +2 affect metal): Greater Power (10 levels, –1 Might cost, +7 Init)

![](_page_135_Picture_14.jpeg)

1 point, Init equal to (Qik + 4), Aquam R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part

Earth elementals are always thirsty, and direct contact with the elemental removes water from the target, inflicting a Fatigue level of damage. Once all Fatigue levels are gone, successive strikes (or rounds of contact) inflict a Light Wound, then a Medium Wound, then a Heavy Wound, and so forth. Fatigue levels may be restored by drinking at least two pints of water (for a Size 0 individual), while wounds are healed as normal.

PeAq 15 (base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Part): Greater Power (15 levels, –1 Might cost, +6 Init)

## *Water Elementals*

The **lymphae** ("pure waters") are also called undines, undena, or ondines (all from Latin *unda*, meaning "fluid, wave"), as well as aquacolae ("water dwellers"), nymphs (a term also applied to certain faeries), and alcyones. Only naturally occurring liquids can produce elementals, typically of salt or fresh water. Water that has been separated from its source cannot be rarefied into a lympha, nor can liquid extracted from its source by human effort. Lymphae in a relaxed state sink into a thin film or puddle, perhaps even soaking into the ground. They can pull themselves up into symmetrical humps faceted with triangular units — their corpuscles are naturally icosahedral. The fluid that makes them is always of the utmost purity, often crystal clear and sparkling.

Lymphae have the best capacity for learning and understanding of all elementals, and are remarkably resilient to damage. However, their slow and languorous movements make them unsuitable as protectors. They are driven by their nature to collect and mix substances together, and their homes are often the site of eclectic collections of garbage that they have gathered. They commonly attack by pulling their opponents down to the ground and then smothering them, separating and recombining their possessions with an obsessive interest.

A Size-0 lympha constitutes a pool of water about 4 feet across and 2 feet deep. At Size +3, the elemental is the size of a small pond or stream; at Size +6 that of a small lake; and at Size +12 equal to a lake, inlet, or respectably sized river. A water elemental's body is composed entirely of water. It can roll across the ground, either slowly if derived from a

![](_page_135_Picture_22.jpeg)

![](_page_136_Picture_1.jpeg)

body of still water, or as fast as the current if from a river or stream. The elemental's speed is halved if moving up even a gentle incline. Most weapons are meaningless to a lympha — blades and piercing weapons simply pass straight through, although bludgeoning weapons can still harm them. A water elemental's attacks only inflict Scuffle damage (**ArM5**, page 175), and it often attempts to disarm, trip, or grab worn items with its Attack Advantage rather than inflict damage (**ArM5**, page 175). A source of fire that does damage less than the elemental's Might is extinguished on contact, while more-powerful flames will evaporate the elemental's body, inflicting "wounds" as normal. Successful fire attacks destroy any Aquam vis that might have been present in the evaporated matter.

#### **Sample Powers**

All water elementals have this power:

#### **Drown**

0 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Aquam R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

After successful melee attack, the elemental can engulf a target whose Size is smaller than its own and attempt to drown him, necessitating a roll to avoid deprivation (**ArM5**, pages 180-181). The victim can attempt to escape from its clutches each round using the Grappling rules (ArM, page 174).

ReAq(Co) 30 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect): Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +1 Init)

Some water elementals have the following powers. Other powers typically mimic Aquam spells, particularly Rego Aquam spells.

#### **Chill Touch**

2 points, Init equal to (Qik + 4), Ignem R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The lympha's touch extracts heat from a target, inflicting +10 damage. This damage is Soaked without the benefit of armor, as the watery body of the elemental seeps through all protection.

PeIg 15 (base 10, +1 Touch): Greater Power (15 levels, –1 Might cost, +6 Init).

#### **Sight of the River**

2 points, Init equal to (Qik – 1), Imaginem R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Room

The elemental can view any location to which it has an unbroken connection of water, regardless of the distance involved. Thus, it may see anyone on the same river, touching

## *Air Elementals*

**Zephyrus** is the name given to an air elemental by members of the Order of Hermes, but they are also known as silvestres, sylphs, aeoliae (wind elementals), nenuphas (cloud elementals), and brontes (thunder and lightning elementals). Any air under the open sky or any natural weather phenomenon can produce a zephyrus. A zephyrus is composed of chains of octohedral corpuscles: in wind elementals, these chains form ropes; cloud elementals consist of interlocked loops; and a lightning elemental is a branched chain of scintillating energy.

Zephyri are utterly restless — they cannot remain still, even for a moment. They are travelers, moving through the world beneath the sky unless constrained by magic. They rarely descend from their lofty heights, but are occasionally curious about what is going on below them. They are highly perceptive, and are aware of everything going on around their home. They can sense the slightest movement of air from any direction, and are impossible to catch by surprise. They crave the disintegration of rigidity and barriers, and many are capable of dissolving structured matter.

A patch of mist constitutes a Size 0 elemental; a Size +4 zephyrus is a wind of sufficient strength to blow a man down, or a small cloud; a Size +6 air elemental is a large cloud; at Size +9 it is a bolt of lightning reaching from the clouds to earth; and at Size +12, a medium-sized storm. A zephyrus' body is composed entirely of air. It is capable of moving through landscape unobstructed by other objects in its way, and can enter any space that is not air-tight. The speed of movement varies by elemental type: a mist elemental can roll at walking pace, whereas a lightning elemental is literally lightning fast. Weapons are meaningless to a creature with this power, they simply pass straight through. However, the elemental has no natural attack and must use its powers instead.

#### **Sample Powers**

All air elementals have this power:

#### **Suffocate**

0 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Auram R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

The elemental surrounds its opponent and enters its lungs, necessitating a roll to avoid deprivation (**ArM5**, pages 180- 181). Escaping the elemental requires the victim to get away from the elemental; its airy body can be simply walked through, but the elemental usually pursues its victim. Compare Quickness + Athletics stress rolls of the victim and the elemental (using Might/5 for the elemental's Athletics); the highest wins. Trying to escape requires a Fatigue roll for the strenuous action (**ArM5**, 178).

PeAu(Co) 30 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect): Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +1 Init)

Some air elementals have the following powers. Other powers typically mimic Auram spells, particularly Rego Auram spells.

#### **Dissolution**

3 points, Init equal to Qik, Animal, Corpus or Terram

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

The cohesiveness of a base Individual of Terram is lost, making it melt as if heated strongly, although the power imparts no heat to the object. Armor drips off its wearer, swords collapse like melting butter, and so forth. At the end of the round, the matter re-solidifies into its new shape. If the item is enchanted, the elemental's Penetration must exceed five times the total pawns of vis invested. The moisture of living bodies prevents them from such a devastating effect; nevertheless, hair, toenails, teeth, claws, and bone are all affected, inflicting +15 damage and ignoring protection from armor.

MuTe(Aq, Co, An) 25 (base 3, +2 Voice, +2 affect metal, +2 affect humans and animals): Greater Power (25 levels, –2 Might cost, +3 Init).

#### **Jupiter's Touch**

5 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Auram R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The touch of the elemental causes a flash of coruscating lightning, inflicting +30 damage. This power is suitable for a lightning or storm elemental.

CrAu 30 (base 5, +1 Touch, +4 unnatural): Greater Power (30 levels, –2 Might cost, +2 Init).

**Vis:** 3 pawns of Auram, in body.

**Notes:** A creature born of storms, it uses its devastating attack only rarely, since it has such a high Might cost. Its Shapeshifter Virtue allows it to adopt the forms of the creatures it has seen: a raven, an eagle, a hound, and a bull.

## *Fire Elementals*

Fire elementals, or **phlegethi** (singular phlegethus, meaning "burners"), also go by a host of other names, such as ignigena (Latin for "fire-born"), vulcans, rolamandri, salamanders (not to be confused with the Beasts of Virtue), and aethnici (a term also used for fiery demons; see *Realms of Power: the Infernal*, page 67). They are uncommon on earth, for they can only rarefy from naturally occurring sources of flame — usually lightning strikes, but occasionally earth-fires, certain natural alchemical reactions, or the fire from the upper atmosphere. Feeding a naturally lit fire with fuel does not inhibit rarefication, and once formed, a fire elemental can consume normal fuel. A fire elemental is often shortlived, lasting as long as it has fuel, and prone to sudden movements of remarkable speed. Man's fascination for fire is often enhanced when viewing fire elementals, and they can easily beguile those who stare too deeply.

An phlegethus appears as a collection of flames that move contrary to nature. Each flame is actually a tetrahedron; sometimes these pyramids may be stretched long and thin, while at other times they may be low and flat. The motivations and instincts of a fire elemental are basic: they desire to burn, to consume cold and replace it with heat, and to escape confinement.

A phlegethus of Size 0 is the size of a typical bonfire. The fire from a lightningstruck tree would raise a Size +6 fire elemental, and a volcano is capable of spawning the largest phlegethi, up to Size +21. The body of a fire elemental is composed entirely of fire. The elemental can only cross surfaces composed of potentially flammable material; the more flammable it is, the faster it can move. Through typical vegetation in a temperate climate, a fire elemental can move at the speed of a running man. It may also jump a gap of non-flammable surface (such as bare rock) up to a width equal to its Magic Might in feet. Weapons are meaningless to a phlegethus; they simply pass straight through the elemental, and may catch fire. A source of water that is smaller than the elemental's Size is evaporated on contact. Larger sources of water quench the elemental's body, inflicting "wounds" as if it were fire damage; typically +5 to +10 damage, but possibly more depending on the quantity. Successful water attacks destroy any Ig-

nem vis that might have been present in the evaporated matter.

#### **Sample Powers**

All fire elementals have this power:

**Burn**

0 points, Init equal to (Qik–2), Ignem R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Anyone touching or being touched by a fire elemental takes damage equal to a stress die plus the entity's current Might pool. This is the usual melee attack of a phlegethus. Any flammable material catches fire on contact; typically, clothes inflict +10 damage per round on their wearer until they are extinguished. Any metal coming into contact with the elemental's body for more than a round heats up, causing the effects of *Heat of the Searing Forge*, but this does not include weapons that attempt to strike it in combat.

Cr(Re)Ig 30 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect): Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might cost, +1 Init)

Some fire elementals have the following powers. Other powers typically mimic Ignem spells, particularly Rego Ignem spells.

**Fascination**

3 points, Init equal to (Qik + 4), Mentem R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

The swirling colors in the elemental's flames can entrance all those who see it. Those failing an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 will stare gape-mouthed at the elemental, unable to act. This roll may be attempted once per round.

ReMe 15 (base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun): Greater Power (15 levels, –1 Might cost, +6 Init).

**Heat of the Searing Forge**

1 point, Init equal to (Qik + 6), Ignem R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Like the Creo Ignem spell of the same name. Note that this power works at a distance, whereas the *Burn* power affects only items that touch the elemental.

CrIg 10 (base 4, +2 Voice): Greater Power (10 levels, –1 Might cost, +7 Init)

## *Appendix*

# *Book of Mundane Beasts*

The beasts of Mythic Europe are not quite the same as normal animals in the real world. The ferocity of wild animals, in particular, is exaggerated for dramatic purposes. In Mythic Europe, it is not uncommon for beasts such as wolves to attack humans.

## *Beast Statistics*

Beasts' Characteristics may take any value, even exceeding –5 or +5. Beasts do not need a Virtue or Flaw to have Characteristics outside the normal human range of –3 to +3. Their starting Characteristics depend on their ecological niche (predator, herbivore, etc.) and are different from the average human Characteristics of all zeroes.

As stated in **ArM5**, p. 191, mundane beasts have a Characteristic called Cunning in place of an Intelligence score. Use Cunning for rolls that would otherwise call for Intelligence, such as finding a way out of a closed barn. Beasts have a limited capacity for problem-solving but they lack imagination, reason, and intelligence as such. Because they lack intelligence, beasts cannot learn new Abilities unless they are trained by an intelligent being. They can improve Abilities their species already has.

For beasts, the Quickness Characteristic has mainly to do with reflexes and agility, and little to do with movement rate. Many animals can run faster than a human, but that does not necessarily mean they should have better Initiative and Defense scores. Animals that run fast, but do not have especially good reflexes, have a note giving them a bonus to running-related rolls.

All mundane beasts have no Might and contain no vis.

## *Modifying Beast Sizes*

Some beasts cover a range of Size categories, and any beast might have its Size magically altered. To increase the Size of a beast, add 2 points of Strength and subtract one point of Quickness for each point of Size added. To decrease size, subtract 2 points of Strength and add one point of Quickness for each point of Size subtracted. Update combat statistics according to the new Characteristics. Larger animals are more powerful, but relatively ungainly.

## *Beast Virtues, Flaws, and Qualities*

Each species of beast has certain Virtues and Flaws that are common to all members of that species. Species Virtue and Flaws are not given for game balance reasons, but rather to provide rules for the unique strengths and qualities of beasts. When designing your own species, simply assign the Virtues and Flaws that describe the species the way you imagine it. It is recommended that a species have at least one point of Flaws for every three points of Virtues. All beasts get their species' Virtues and Flaws for free.

Exceptional beasts may also take individual Virtues or Flaws that set them apart from others of their kind. Any individual Virtues a beast takes must be balanced with individual Flaws, just as for human characters.

Qualities are features of the animal that affect its capabilities. See *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults* (pages 40–43) for a list of Qualities and their effects.

## *New Virtues for Beasts*

**Ferocity**

*minor, beasts only*

Like a magus or companion character, you have Confidence points. Unlike a human character, you may use your Confidence Points only in situations where your natural animal ferocity is triggered, such as when defending your den or fighting a natural enemy. Describe a situation that activates your Confidence score, and take three points for you to use when those circumstances are met.

## *Beasts in Combat*

Beasts fight much as humans do: they can use most combat options from the Obstacles chapter, including disengaging, (untrained) group combat, exertion, and nonlethal combat. Beasts are clever enough to use exertion and other combat options to their best advantage. Only a few beasts have the cooperative instincts to fight as a trained group. All others must use the untrained group rules.

Beasts with the Ferocity Virtue have Confidence Points, which may be spent in battle under certain circumstances.

Some beasts have more than one natural weapon. The best weapon is always listed first. Secondary weapons are less effective, but might be useful when the primary weapon is unavailable. For example, a bear usually relies on its claws, but might attack with its teeth while climbing with its claws after a victim. Regardless of how many weapons a beast has, it may only attack with one weapon in a given round.

### *Magic*

![](_page_140_Picture_1.jpeg)

The following beasts can be used in any **Ars Magica 5th Edition** saga.

## *Adder (Viperis)*

**Characteristics:** Cun –1, Per –2, Pre –6, Com –6, Str –8, Sta +2, Dex +2, Qik +3

**Size: –**4

**Confidence Score:** 0

**Virtues and Flaws:** Lightning Reflexes, Infamous

**Qualities:** Ambush Predator, Loathsome Appearance, Slippery, Venomous

**Personality Traits:** Hostile +2 **Reputations:** Venomous (local) 4

**Combat:**

*Fangs:* Init +3, Attack +8, Defense +7\*, Damage –7; \* +6 to Defense vs grapple attacks **Soak:** +2

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious **Wound Penalties:** –1 (1), –3 (2), –5 (3), Incapacitated (4), Dead (5+)

**Abilities:** Awareness 2 (prey), Brawl 2 (fangs), Hunt 4 (rodents), Stealth 4 (stalking prey), Survival 3 (grassy areas)

#### **Powers:**

*Venomous Bite,* 0 Points, Init 0. When the adder attacks, compare its Attack Advantage to the victim's armor Protection (not his Soak). If the adder's advantage is higher, the victim suffers the effects of adder venom as listed in the Poison Table on p. 180 of ArM5, regardless of whether the bite inflicts an actual wound. The storyguide may adjust the required Attack Advantage for special circumstances: for instance, high boots might offer an effective Protection +3 against the adder's special attack even though they don't protect against normal attacks.

**Natural Weapons:** Fangs: Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1.

**Appearance:** The common adder is a small snake, usually about a foot and a half in length. Its color varies from pale grey or yellow to red, with diamond-shaped black markings along its back. Some individuals are completely black. The adder's head is triangular in shape.

The adder is a venomous snake commonly found throughout Mythic Europe (except in Ireland). It is hardy enough to hibernate through the winter. It hunts rodents, lizards, and frogs by hiding and waiting for prey to pass nearby. Its venom is weak and can sicken, but not usually kill, a man.

The adder is prone to attack reflexively

when anything stumbles across its hiding place (see the Lightning Reflexes Virtue, **ArM5** page 45). If the adder attacks a victim who is unaware of its presence, it automatically wins Initiative in the first round of combat and gains a +3 to its Attack Total for the first round only. Because it's so thin and flexible, the adder gains a +6 bonus to Defense against grapple attacks.

## *Bear (Ursus)*

**Characteristics:** Cun +1, Per 0, Pre 0, Com –5, Str +6, Sta +4, Dex +2, Qik 0

**Size:** +2

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Ferocity (when injured), Improved Characteristics (x2), Tough, Greedy (minor), Reclusive

**Personality Traits:** Brave +3, Slothful +3, Aggressive +2

**Reputations:** Ferocious (local) 2

**Combat:**

*Claws:* Init 0, Attack +13, Defense +9, Damage +10

*Teeth:* Init 0, Attack +11, Defense +7, Damage +7

*Grapple:* Init 0, Attack +7, Defense +5, Damage n/a

**Soak:** +10

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0/0, –1/–1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1–7), –3 (8–14), –5 (15– 21), Incapacitated (22–28), Dead (29+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 3 (sprinting), Awareness 3 (prey), Brawl 5 (claws), Hunt 4 (deer), Survival 5 (foraging), Swim 3 (against the current)

**Natural Weapons:** Large Claws: Init 0, Atk +5, Def +3, Dam +4; Teeth: Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1. The bear's tough hide and thick fur combine to give it a Protection of +3.

**Appearance:** The bear is a large, shaggy beast that weighs up to fifty stone (700 pounds) and stands over seven feet tall on its hind legs. Its coat may be light brown or yellowish in color to black; most often, it is medium brown. The bear has large claws and makes a bellowing roar.

The only bear species that exists in Mythic Europe is known today as the brown bear. It can be found throughout Mythic Europe in forests, mountains, and even the northern tundra. Its range extends across North Africa and through Asia as well. It is most common in wilderness areas like the Pyrenees, the Alps, and Scandinavia and Russia.

The bear makes its lair in the earth, either in a cave or in a den it digs with its mighty claws. It lives mainly by foraging but can hunt and kill anything up to the size of a red deer. Men hunt the bear by setting deadfalls or chasing it with hounds. Few dare to engage it at close range with spears, for it is extremely powerful, and ferocious when wounded.

The brown bear can run quickly, gaining a +3 bonus to rolls involving running. It can stand on its hind legs so as to attack a man on horseback. It can climb trees and is a strong swimmer.

According to Pliny the Elder, the he-bear sleeps for forty days in winter and the shebear sleeps for four months. The bear cub is born a shapeless lump of flesh until the shebear licks it into the shape of a little bear.

## *Boar, Wild (Aper)*

**Characteristics:** Cun 0, Per 0, Pre –4, Com –5, Str +2, Sta +2, Dex 0, Qik +1

**Size:** 0

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Berserk, Enduring Constitution, Ferocity (when cornered), Tough, Greedy (minor), Wrathful (minor)

**Qualities:** Aggressive, Hardy, Herd Animal, Tireless, Tough Hide

**Personality Traits:** Brave +4, Angry +3 **Reputations:** Ill-tempered (local) 2 **Combat:**

*Tusks:* Init +1, Attack +10, Defense +9, Damage +7

*Tusks (berserk):* Init +1, Attack +12, Defense +7, Damage +7

**Soak:** +7

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0/0, –2/–2, –4/–4, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1–5), –3 (6–10), –5 (11– 15), Incapacitated (16–20), Dead (21+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 4 (sprinting), Awareness 3 (foraging), Brawl 5 (tusks), Survival 5 (forests)

**Natural Weapons:** Tusks: Init 0, Atk +4, Def +2, Dam +5. The boar's hide has a Protection of +2.

**Appearance:** The wild boar has prominent tusks and a hairy ridge along its spine. It is densely covered in short bristles ranging in color from grey to black or brown. Its legs are longer than those of a domestic pig and it can run quickly for short distances.

The wild boar lives in forests throughout Mythic Europe, where it forages by night and rests by day. Wild swine travel in groups called sounders of twenty or more individuals, though they are also encountered singly.

In France and England the boar is called *la bête noire*, "the black beast," for its evil

![](_page_140_Picture_60.jpeg)

temper. It is a favorite sport of noblemen, who hunt it from horseback using hounds, lances, and swords. According to Pliny the Elder, the wild boar toughens its hide by rubbing against trees.

Boars vary greatly in size, from eight stone (112 pounds) to more than thirty stone (420 pounds). The largest boars are Size +1.

## *Bull (Taurus)*

**Characteristics:** Cun –2, Per 0, Pre –4, Com –4, Str +5, Sta +3, Dex 0, Qik –1

**Size:** +2

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Affinity with Brawl, Ferocity (charging), Tough, Oversensitive (to provocation)

**Qualities:** Aggressive, Domesticated, Tough Hide

**Personality Traits:** Aggressive +2 **Reputations:** Strong 4 (local)

**Combat:**

*Horns:* Init 0, Attack +8, Defense +3, Damage +7

**Soak:** +8

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0/0, –1/–1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1–7), –3 (8–14), –5 (15– 21), Incapacitated (22–28), Dead (29+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 4 (charging), Awareness 3 (predators), Brawl 5 (horns)

**Natural Weapons:** Large horns: Init +2, Atk +3, Def +2, Dam +3. The bull's tough hide has a Protection of +2.

**Appearance:.** These statistics are for a bull of the Spanish type, which is black in color, weighs about eighty stone (1120 pounds), and has sharp, inward-curving horns and a hump on its back.

There are many breeds of cattle in Mythic Europe, some of them larger than this specimen. Most breeds in Mythic Europe are short and broad-bodied and have long horns. They may be black, white, tan, red, or brown in color. Some breeds have a coat of shaggy fur. Pliny the Elder writes of magical bulls that live in India, but the statistics here are for a mundane bull.

The bull does not attack without reason, but it is easily — sometimes accidentally — provoked. When a bull charges, it exerts itself to gain an Attack bonus and may simultaneously spend Confidence.

In Spain, the Moorish nobles make a spectacle of fighting bulls from horseback on festival days. The sport of bull-baiting, where spectators watch a tethered bull being killed by a pack of dogs, is known throughout Mythic Europe. Bulls are somewhat clumsy fighters at first, but if they survive combat they quickly grow "wise" and become very dangerous. The speed with which they learn to fight is reflected in their Affinity with Brawl.

**Personality Traits:** Curious +4, Timid +2 **Reputations:** Evil 2 (local) This reputation is strongest in Celtic areas, and weaker or unknown in other places.

**Combat:**

*Claws:* Init +3, Attack +8, Defense +10, Damage –5

*Teeth:* Init +4, Attack +8, Defense +7, Damage –6

**Natural Weapons:** Claws: Init –1, Attack +2, Defense +3, Damage +2. Teeth: Init 0, Attack +3, Defense +1, Damage +1. The cat's dense fur gives it a Protection of +1.

**Appearance:** In Mythic Europe, domestic cats are short-haired and tend to have grey or yellow-orange fur with darker stripes, though black, white, and calico cats are not uncommon.

The cat has a reputation for evil among the common folk. They accuse it of stealing the breath of babies, though only supernatural cats can do such a thing. Cats are sometimes tolerated because they keep down the population of rats, but they are not commonly kept as pets and they are often killed by peasants out of superstition or cruelty. For some reason, the cat's bad reputation is unknown in England and it is looked upon more favorably in that land. Pliny the Elder says nothing about the cat's reputation, noting only that the cat is the natural enemy of mice and that its eyes are so keen it can see in the dark.

This description is for domestic cats. The European wildcat looks much like a large domestic cat with a thicker, shaggier coat and a bushy tail. The wildcat has a grey-brown coat with black stripes and a white underbelly.

Cats generally flee from any opponent larger than themselves. If a cat has successfully crept up on its prey, it automatically wins Initiative for the first round of combat and gains a +3 bonus to its Attack roll for the first round only. Cat are excellent climbers and jumpers, gaining a +3 bonus to appropriate rolls due to their Perfect Balance.

**Appearance:** These statistics are for a gyrfalcon, the largest and most prized of falcons. Its wingspan can exceed four feet. It has a short, hooked beak and dark eyes. Its plumage may be white, grey, or dark brown and has a banded pattern.

The falcon is among the swiftest of birds and hunts on the wing, overtaking its prey in flight. Nobles use falcons to hunt game birds such as partridge. In the wild, the gyrfalcon can kill prey as large as a goose, and usually hunts birds and small rodents. It lives in cold northern lands including Scandinavia, Iceland, and Russia.

Other, smaller species of falcon are Size –4. All falcons are fast fliers and gain a +3 bonus to rolls involving speed.

**Abilities:** Athletics 4 (long-distance running), Awareness 3 (noises)

**Natural Weapons:** The weapon statistics for a courser's kick are Init +2, Atk +2, Def +2, Dam +1.

**Appearance:** The courser is a swift horse belonging to a mid-sized, athletic breed like the Andalusian. The Andalusian stallion is tall and strong, weighing about 80 stone (1120 pounds) and standing 15 hands (60 inches) high. It has a gracefully curving neck, a broad chest, straight back, and a flowing mane and tail. Its coat may be grey, black, chestnut, or roan.

The courser is a swift horse used by knights and nobles for hunting, traveling, and carrying important messages. The courser is not trained for battle and panics relatively easily; the statistics for its kick are given in case a character is unlucky enough to be next to a panic-stricken horse.

A light horse trained for battle is called a charger. To create a charger, replace the courser's Noncombatant Flaw with Proud (minor), change the Brave Personality Trait to zero, and give the animal a Brawl skill of 2 (hooves). Another kind of light horse is the the palfrey, which is a riding horse chosen for its gentle gait and often ridden by inexperienced riders or by ladies. To convert a courser to a palfrey, reduce Quickness by two points and increase Dexterity by the same amount. Palfreys have the Noncombatant Flaw.

Any light horse – courser, charger, or palfrey – gets a +3 to rolls involving running or jumping.

## *Horse, Destrier (Equus)*

**Characteristics:** Cun –2, Per 0, Pre 0, Com –4, Str +6, Sta +3, Dex +1, Qik –1

**Abilities:** Athletics 5 (balancing), Brawl 3 (hooves)

**Natural Weapons:** The weapon statistics for a destrier's kick are Init +2, Atk +2, Def +2, Dam +1.

**Appearance:** The destrier is a heavy war horse. One breed used as destriers is the Percheron, a huge horse weighing over 140 stone (1960 pounds) and standing over 16 hands (64 inches) high at the withers. It has a heavy, slightly curved neck, a broad and deep chest, and powerful, stocky legs. Its coat is either grey or black in color.

The destrier, or heavy war horse, has been bred in Mythic Europe since at least the time of Charles Martel (8th century A.D.). Some of the large horse breeds in Mythic Europe are the Percheron, the Belgian, and the Friesian. These horses are used mainly for battle; farm work is done using oxen.

The destrier is almost always a stallion. It is highly trained so it will charge without fear when its rider commands. When pressed into melee, it can rear on its hind legs and lash out with its forehooves. Though huge, the destrier is agile and can balance on its hind legs for several combat rounds without difficulty. It is trained to fight independently of its rider, so it can help defend him if he should be dismounted or badly wounded.

Like all horses, the destrier is a fast runner and gains a +3 bonus to rolls involving speed. It is too heavy to be much of a jumper.

There are many breeds of dogs in Mythic Europe, many of them similar to breeds that exist in our world (though they may be called by different names). The largest dogs are used for guarding livestock or hunting dangerous beasts like wolves, bears, and wild boars. They include the breeds like the bloodhound, elkhound, Rottweiler, mastiff, and great Dane. Smaller hounds, such as the greyhound, Basset hound, and Dalmatian, are Size –1 and are often used to hunt deer, fox, and small game. Medium-sized dogs (Size – 2) include spaniels, used to chase small game and to flush game birds for falconers; terriers, which hunt badgers, stoats, and rats; and the Welsh corgi, a small cattle-herding dog. The smallest dogs (Size –3) include lap-dogs, small terriers bred for vermin control, and the tiny Italian greyhound. Several breeds that are popular in the real world, such as the German shepherd and most retrievers, did not exist in the middle ages. These statistics are for the bloodhound, and the Characteristics of other breeds may be different.

All dogs have a good sense of smell, and the bloodhound's sense is so keen it gets a +3 bonus to all related rolls. Dogs also get a +3 to endurance-related rolls due to their Long-Winded Virtue.

A pack of dogs may fight as a trained group under the leadership of a human Master of the Pack. Use the Master's Animal Handling score instead of his Leadership score to determine how many dogs he can command at a time.

It has a short, broad muzzle with powerful jaws and teeth. Its coat is tawny and the male lion has a dark, shaggy mane. The fearsome roar of the lion can be heard from a great distance.

Pliny the Elder writes that, during his time, lions were found in Europe only between the rivers Achelous and Mestus (in Greece), and that they also inhabited Syria and North Africa. The European lion was extinct before the middle ages in historical Europe, but might have survived in Mythic Europe. Pliny writes that there are two kinds of lions: those with long manes, which are bold; and those with curly manes, which are timid. These statistics are for the bold variety. Pliny also notes that the lion will not attack a man who lies prostrate before it.

The lion can make impressive leaps and gets +3 to jump-related rolls. It can easily leap high enough to attack a man on horseback.

**Abilities:** Athletics 4 (sprinting), Awareness 3 (predators), Brawl 4 (dodge), Survival 3 (woodlands)

**Natural Weapons**: During the autumn and winter, a stag has antlers with the following weapon statistics: Init +2, Atk +3, Def +2, Dam +3. In spring, it sheds its antlers and must fight with its hooves until the following autumn: Init +2, Atk +2, Def +2, Dam +1.

**Appearance:** These statistics are for the red deer, one of the largest deer in Mythic Europe. Adult males average 40 to 50 stone in weight (560 to 700 pounds) depending on the richness of the available food supply, and may be up to 15 hands high — as tall as some horses, but more lightly built. The red deer's coat is reddish-brown in winter and tan in summer, with a lighter rump and underbelly. Stags have a shaggy mane of dark fur and an impressive rack of antlers over four feet across from tip to tip. They make a deep, bellowing roar during the autumn mating season.

The red deer lives in open woodlands, moors, and grasslands throughout Mythic Europe. It avoids dense, tangled forests but can be found in alpine forests and meadows. The species is called "elk" in North America. The size of the red deer varies from +1 where grazing is poor to +2 where the grass is rich and plentiful. Does are smaller than stags and lack antlers.

The red deer is a favorite quarry of hunters. In some places, only nobles are allowed to hunt it. The stag usually flees from combat, trying to draw enemies away from its herd, but it can fight if it must. All deer gain a +3 bonus to rolls involving running or jumping.

## *Wolf (Lupus)*

**Characteristics:** Cun +2, Per 0, Pre –2, Com 0, Str –1, Sta +3, Dex +2, Qik +2

**Size:** –1

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Improved Characteristics (x2), Ferocity (when hungry), LongWinded, Sharp Ears, Compulsion (killing), Infamous

**Qualities:** Aggressive, Hardy, Keen Sense of Smell, Pack Animal/Pack Leader, Pursuit Predator, Sharp Ears, Thick Fur, Vocal

**Personality Traits:** Brave +3, Cowardly +3 **Reputations:** Bloodthirsty (local) 4

**Combat:**

*Teeth:* Init +2, Attack +11, Defense +9, Damage 0

**Soak:** +4

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0/0, –1/–1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1–4), –3 (5–8), –5 (9–12), Incapacitated (13–16)

**Abilities:** Athletics 5 (distance running), Awareness 3 (smell), Brawl 5 (teeth), Hunt 4 (track by smell), Survival 3 (winter)

**Natural Weapons:** Teeth: Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1. Its thick fur gives it a Protection of +1.

**Appearance:** The wolf has erect, triangular ears, a narrow muzzle, and a coat of shaggy fur. Its eyes are usually yellowish and have a steady, unsettling gaze. Its color may be any shade from pale grey through dark brown, often with lighter patches on the sides of the face and around the eyes. The wolf can bark, but its better-known sound is its eerie, piercing howl.

The wolf is found throughout Mythic Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. According to Pliny the Elder, the wolves of northern regions are fierce while those of Africa and Egypt are weak

Wolves are greatly feared by commoners. They are hunted with large hounds because they kill livestock. In some lands, there is a bounty on their hides. Many tales attribute supernatural powers to wolves, but most wolves are mundane and have no powers at all.

The Flaws above reflect the medieval perception of the wolf as a wanton, bloodthirsty killer. Individual wolves, such as the Animal Companion of a player character, may substitute another Personality Flaw in place of the Compulsion. A wolf Animal Companion that goes around killing livestock could be disruptive to stories. Regardless of such a wolf's actual personality, mundanes are likely to treat it with a great deal of fear and suspicion.

The leader of a wolf pack has the additional Ability, Leadership 5 (wolves). A pack may fight as a trained group when its leader is present. A wolf pack is extremely dangerous.
