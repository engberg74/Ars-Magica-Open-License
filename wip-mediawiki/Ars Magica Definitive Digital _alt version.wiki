== Preface ==

here's so much to love about Ars Magica, and it's gratifying to see it find an enduring place in the hearts of so many gamers. Mark Rein•Hagen and I put everything

we had into this game, and it shows.

I love the core promise of the Ars Magica — wizards done right. In real-world lore, wizards are beyond the limits of regular mortals, while in RPGs they are typically on par with warriors and thieves — just one more class. I love how various elements of the game, such as houses and covenants, support this central promise.

I love how each covenant is a character in its own right, with its own origin and destiny. I love how they support long-term play and how creating a covenant sets a tone for what the campaign is going to do. I love how covenants have more-powerful magi as NPCs, reinforcing the idea that only thing more powerful than a magus is another magus. I love how they give magi the towers, libraries, laboratories, and more that genuine wizards are supposed to have.

I love the houses and how they help ground a magus both in an ancient tradition and in the politics of the day. I love how the various houses provide players and Storyguides with plenty of narrative leverage, both for conflicts and for connections. Ars Magica's houses were inspired by the cults of RuneQuest, and in turn they inspired the various factions that become popular in '90s-era RPGs. Taking sides seems to appeal to something deep in our nature.

I love spontaneous magic. Without the ability to do little things, like light a campfire with the snap of a finger, can you be a genuine wizard?

I love the verb-object system for magic arts. I love how 15 magical arts overlap to make 50 verb-object pairs. I love the sound of &quot;creo ignem.&quot;

I love how the game uses Latin. I'm a word-root geek.

I love the grogs, how they play up the power of the magi, help the companions shine, and make character death more palatable.

I love the companions and how readily a player can build the companion that they want. I love how they operate in a middle position between the arcane magi and the mundane population at large.

I love the core dice mechanic. It's so straightforward that I later repurposed it as the core mechanic for D&amp;D 3rd Edition.

I love the 1-3-6-10 scaling system for buying skills and arts.

I love how in 2nd edition we redefined the setting as Europe in the Middle Ages. As Ken Hite says, one sure way to improve your RPG campaign is to set it on Earth.

I even love the title. &quot;Ars Magica&quot; is an unfortunate title for a game that no one's ever heard of before, self-published by two nobodies. But a classic game, one that has stood the test of time and has earned its recognition — for that game it's a perfect title.

And I love that you now have this amazing edition in your hands. Enjoy!

== I. Introduction ==

n the day the faeries came to burn the village, Walter was repairing the thatch on his roof. As he worked, he kept half an eye on the strangers who had

arrived the previous evening. Walter didn't like the look of them, particularly the woman. She looked like the sort who sold watered ale, then robbed and killed men while they slept.

The group seemed to be waiting for something, and when the faeries rode out of the woods Walter thought he knew what. The grass blackened and smoked in the hoofprints left by the shining crimson horses, and the hands of the faerie nobles were swathed in flames, as always. Menacing storm clouds gathered in their wake. Walter shouted the alarm, and the villagers ran for the church. He shifted to get off the roof, and his leg went straight through the damaged thatch, trapping him. His warning shouts changed to cries for help, but the other villagers knew the rules.

Run straight for the church. Stay in the church until the faeries have gone. Do not come out to help anyone, no matter who it looks and sounds like.

Helpless, Walter watched his death approach as the priest began to ring the church bell. The strangers split up, the woman moving forward by herself and calling to the faeries in a language Walter didn't understand. For a moment, he thought she was a spy for the faeries, but then the leader threw a bolt of flame, and Walter thought she was merely dead.

She wasn't. The fire that could destroy a house in a moment had left the woman completely unharmed. She spoke again, more loudly this time, gesturing at the faerie leader's horse as she did so. A moment later the horse shrieked, a dreadful, high sound that went on and on, and bucked its rider off. The faerie got to his feet as the horse rolled, still screaming in agony, igniting small fires as it writhed.

The woman spoke again, and this time the faerie listened. Walter couldn't understand what

they were saying. The discussion went on for some time, as the horse got to its feet, seemingly unharmed, and the woman's companions came forward to join her. In the end, some sort of agreement was reached, and the faeries turned and rode back into the forest.

Walter watched the woman, clearly a witch of some sort, approach his house, looking up with an unpleasant smirk on her face. She spoke and gestured again, and Walter felt some force grab him. He was lifted off the roof, but then placed gently, standing, on the ground in front of the witch. She spoke to one of her escort, who then spoke to Walter.

&quot;My mistress would like to talk to the priest and bailiff. Please bring them here.&quot;

Walter did not feel like arguing, and ran to the church, shouting that the faeries were gone.

<span id="melcome-to-ars-magica"></span>
= Melcome to Ars Magica =

ragons lair in the mountains, angels watch over the Church, faeries dance in the forests, and demons tempt men and women to their ultimate downfall. The

magi of the Order of Hermes live in a world of mythic power, the world of Mythic Europe. Welcome to that world.

Ars Magica is a roleplaying game, wherein you and your friends tell the stories of a group of powerful wizards, magi of the Order of Hermes, and their allies in the world of Mythic Europe. Mythic Europe is much like the Europe of 1220, the middle ages, but dragons, demons, angels, and faeries are all unquestionably real, and no aspect of society is untouched by myth.

Ars Magica is a game about magic, and its rules for magic are widely regarded as the best in any roleplaying game. They combine flexibility and rigor, allowing you to create powerful wizards who can do almost anything, while providing clear guidelines on just how powerful a wizard needs to be to do anything you can think of. The rules also cover the creation of enchanted devices, binding familiars, and training apprentices to carry on your magical legacy. The time an Ars Magica magus spends in his laboratory is at least as important to him as the time he spends on adventures.

This book is the core rulebook for the Fifth Edition of Ars Magica. Some of you will have played previous editions of the game, and will find much here that is familiar, although improved. For others, this is your first encounter with Ars Magica, so everything will be new and wonderful.

<span id="basic-ideas"></span>
== Basic Ideas ==

n many ways, Ars Magica is very similar to most other tabletop, or pen-and-paper, roleplaying games. Players have characters, who are

defined by a set of numbers, and control their character's actions by telling the other players what they do. One player, called the storyguide in Ars Magica, handles most of the world, deciding what antagonists and extras do. Conflicts, or tasks that might be beyond a character's capabilities, are resolved according to the rules described in this book, and a die roll.

There are also a number of differences. None of these features are unique to '''Ars Magica''', but they are rare enough that you can have played roleplaying games for years without encountering them.

First, the available character types are not equal in power. Hermetic magi are more powerful than other possible player characters, far more powerful in many cases. Power does not necessarily correspond to how interesting a character is to play, and The Gift that allows magi to work magic also causes them problems in most social situations.

Second, most players have more than one character. This is called troupe-style roleplaying, and is discussed in detail in the Sagas chapter. The role of storyguide may also pass around the group, or troupe, and player characters are divided between central characters (magi and companions) and supporting cast (grogs). A player would normally only play one central character at a time, but might play several grogs at once. This

he following terms are some of the more important in the game, and they come up repeatedly in what follows.

Bonisagus: The brilliant eighth-century magus who developed the Parma Magica, and with the help of the other Founders, the whole of Hermetic Magic. The founder of House Bonisagus.

The Church: All Christians, whether priests or not. Also used in this book to refer specifically to the organizational structures of the Church in Western Europe.

companion: A game term, not used by characters, referring to central characters who are not magi.

Code of Hermes: The laws governing the Order of Hermes.

Covenant: Strictly, a group of magi bound together by an agreement going beyond the Code of Hermes. By extension, the place where those magi live, and all the other people who live there with them. Almost all Ars Magica sagas center on a single covenant.

The Divine: The greatest power in the universe, generally believed to be the creator and sustainer of all existence. It backs the Church, the Jews, and the Muslims.

Faerie: One of the four supernatural realms. Faeries always care about humans, sometimes in the way a torturer cares about his victims.

filius/filia: A magus trained by a given magus. Only used after apprenticeship. After the Gauntlet, a new magus becomes the filius of the maga who trained him.

Formulaic magic: Spells that have been worked out in detail ahead of time. They have one effect each, but allow magi to use their full power.

The Founders: The twelve magi who founded the Order of Hermes in the eighth century: Bonisagus, Bjornaer, Criamon, Diedne, Flambeau, Guernicus, Jerbiton, Mercere, Merinita, Tremere, Tytalus, and Verditius. In many modern accounts, Diedne's name is replaced with Trianoma's.

Gauntlet: In full, the Apprentice's Gauntlet. The final test administered to an apprentice to determine whether he is ready to become a magus; it differs significantly between Houses.

The Gift: The ability to use almost any form of magic, with proper training. All magi have The Gift. The Gift makes people around a character uneasy.

grog: A game term referring to supporting player characters. Characters also use it, but mainly to refer to warriors employed by a covenant.

Hedge magic: A contemptuous term used within the Order of Hermes for any magic other than Hermetic magic.

Hermetic magic: The extremely powerful and flexible magic practiced by the members of the Order of Hermes.

The Infernal: One of the four supernatural realms. Infernal creatures seek to corrupt and destroy people.

maga/magus: A member of the Order of Hermes who can use Hermetic magic. Used by both players and characters. 'Maga' is the feminine form, 'magus' the masculine. The neuter is 'magum', while the plural form used in the Order is 'magi'.

<span id="rounding"></span>
== Rounding ==

The rules for Ars Magica sometimes involve division. In most cases, a rule specifies whether you should round up or down, but if it does not, round down.

Magic: One of the four supernatural realms. Magical creatures often do not care one way or the other about humans.

Mythic Europe: The world of Ars Magica. Much like medieval Europe in 1220, except that the myths are true.

Order of Hermes: An order of wizards stretching across the whole of Mythic Europe, bound by an oath that keeps them from fighting each other or trying to rule the mundanes. One of the most central organizations in the game.

parens: The magus who trained another magus. This title is only used after apprenticeship; at Gauntlet, the master becomes the parens of the new magus.

Parma Magica: A ritual learned by all Hermetic magi at the conclusion of their apprenticeship, which allows them to resist magic. The first of Bonisagus's great discoveries.

Quaesitor: The investigators of the Order of Hermes, they find Hermetic criminals and present evidence of their crimes at Tribunal.

Redcap: One of the messengers of the Order of Hermes. Most do not have The Gift.

Ritual magic: Particularly powerful spells that take hours to cast and require the use of vis. They allow magi to use their full power.

The Schism War: A war in the early eleventh century in which House Diedne was eliminated, and which nearly tore the Order apart.

sodalis (pl. sodales): The normal term used by magi to refer to other magi. It is a term used between equals, and emphasizes that all Hermetic magi are equal within the Order.

spell: An individual use of magic, generally Hermetic magic. There is no real limit on the number of spells a magus can cast in a day, although casting too many in quick succession is likely to exhaust him.

Spontaneous magic: Magic created by a magus on the spur of the moment, to meet an immediate need. Generally much weaker than Formulaic magic, but much more flexible.

Trianoma: The maga who met Bonisagus soon after he invented the Parma Magica. She took on the political mission of bringing Europe's wizards together in a single Order.

# One of the thirteen areas into which the Order of Hermes divides Mythic Europe.
# The meetings of the magi in one of those areas, normally held once every seven years.

Vis: Raw magic. The most valuable thing to most magi.

<span id="die-rolls"></span>
== Die Rolls ==

he success or failure of most actions in an '''Ars Magica''' story is determined by rolling dice. For non-magical actions, the roll is normally Characteristic + Ability

* Die Roll against an Ease Factor. If the total equals or exceeds the Ease Factor, the action succeeds. The amount by which the result exceeds the Ease Factor gives some indication of how successful the action was. Magic uses the same basic rules, but there are special rules for determining what to add to the die roll, and the number that the total must beat.

<span id="simple-die"></span>
== Simple Die ==

Roll a ten-sided die. Each number counts for its value, except that a zero counts as ten.

<span id="stress-die"></span>
== Stress Die ==

Stress dice are rolled when a character is under stress, and thus might succeed spectacularly, or fail with equal flair. Such a significant failure is called a botch, and always has serious effects.

For a stress roll, roll a ten-sided die. One and zero have special meanings, but the other numbers count for their value, as normal. On a roll of one, roll again and double the number rolled. If the reroll is also a one, roll again and quadruple. On second and subsequent rolls, a zero counts as ten. If a player rolled ten consecutive ones, the number rolled on the eleventh throw would be multiplied by 1024. Stress die totals in the hundreds are likely to happen a handful of times in a long-running saga.

On the first roll, zero counts as zero, and you must normally roll for a botch. Roll a number of tensided dice determined by the situation, called the botch dice, and if any of them show a zero, you have botched. If you roll no zeroes on the botch dice, the die roll is simply a zero.

Some stress rolls cannot botch. In that case, a zero on the initial roll is simply a roll of zero. Similarly, if a character has qualities that reduce the number of applicable botch dice to zero, the stress roll cannot botch.

On a botch, your total for the roll is never any higher than zero, in addition to any other consequences. If you roll a zero but do not botch, the total is calculated as normal, adding zero from the die roll. If your modifier for the die roll is negative, the total is equal to your modifier (and therefore less than zero), and something particularly bad still happens.

For example, consider a character with a Characteristic + Ability total of 9 making a stress roll.

| Re-roll, doubling the result. Zeros count as ten. If more ones are rolled, continue re-rolling and doubling.
|-

| Die roll result is the number showing on the die.
|}

If the roll comes up 6, he has a total of 15, 9 from the Characteristic + Ability total, plus 6 from the die roll.

If the first roll comes up a 1, he re-rolls and doubles the result. If the second result is also a 1, he does so again. So, if he rolls two 1s and then a 5, he has a final total of 29: 9 from Characteristic + Ability, and 20, from multiplying the final 5 by 4.

If the first roll comes up a 0, he needs to check for a botch. If none of the botch dice come up 0, his total is 9, the Characteristic + Ability total, plus 0 from the die roll. If any of the botch dice come up 0, his total is 0. The Characteristic + Ability total is also negated by the botch.

<span id="botch-dice"></span>
== Botch Dice ==

Botch dice represent the chance that something will go seriously wrong in an activity. The number of botch dice should reflect how likely a problem is, and the number of botch dice that come up zero determine how badly something has gone wrong.

There are some situations where, although a character could do very well, he could not do very badly. This applies, for example, if the character is making something, but has time to do it again if the first attempt goes badly wrong. A disaster might happen, but would not be the final result, so a botch is not really possible. In such cases, no botch dice should be rolled.

The base for most situations is a single botch die. For example, a person climbing a cliff in fair weather would get a single botch die. Factors making a disaster more likely increase the number of botch die. A strong wind might add a single botch die to the climber, while a weak and crumbling surface might also add a botch die.

The nearby insert gives the chance of a botch for a given number of botch dice. Note that, as the character must first roll a zero on the stress die, the chance of a botch can never be higher than 10%.

Multiple zeroes on the botch dice indicate that things have gone very wrong indeed. Three or more zeroes indicate that things have gone about as wrong as they could. The consequences of this depend on what the character is doing.

For example, consider the character climbing a crumbling cliff in a high wind. If he botches, he falls, as that is the obvious disaster. A single botch indicates that he falls fairly early in the climb, and takes only a little damage. A double botch indicates that he falls a bit over half way up, while a triple botch indicates that he gets almost to the top, and then falls. The damage in each case will depend on the height of the cliff and what is to be found at the base.

<span id="ii-the-order-of-hermes"></span>
== II. The Order of Hermes ==

he Order of Hermes is an organization of magi that spans the whole of Mythic Europe, even reaching some distance beyond. It has about 1200

members, living in thirteen Tribunals which divide up the continent. In the Magical Realm, no single group can even think to challenge the Order as a whole, but the power of God is far beyond even Hermetic magi. This chapter lays out the history and current state of the Order of Hermes, to which Ars Magica characters are almost all affiliated in some way.

<span id="the-history-of-the-order"></span>
== The History of the Order ==

The practice of magic and wizardry goes back to the very beginnings of civilization. Gifted individuals have always found ways to utilize their power, often dominating the unGifted for a time, before the envy, suspicion, and hatred engendered by tyrannical behavior and the effects of The Gift brought them down.

Three things worked against the formation of magical societies or orders of wizards. The first was the effect of The Gift. Wizards who did meet naturally mistrusted one another, and could rarely agree to work together. Even if they agreed once, future meetings often planted the seeds of betrayal. This was compounded by the second factor: the lack of magic resistance. This almost guaranteed that the wizard who struck first would destroy his opponent, and thus encouraged pre-emptive strikes. Finally, every wizard had his own understanding of magic, and sharing this knowledge was a long and troublesome process. There was little that could be shared easily.

One of the few even partial successes in this regard was the Roman Cult of Mercury. Its members rarely met in person, communicating by letter or messenger, except when they needed to gather to perform the great rituals that gave the Cult its power. Further, the rules of the Cult specified that anyone who killed a Cult member should be hunted down and killed by the other members. This rule was enforced quite strictly, greatly reducing the incentive to pre-emptive strikes. Finally, the Cult of Mercury had access to a number of magical effects which could be learned relatively easily, even by someone who already knew many of them. This gave the wizards some motivation to share knowledge.

Nevertheless, suspicions grew within the Cult that some members were hoarding knowledge, ready for a major strike against the other members. Soon after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Cult tore itself apart in internal conflict, leaving isolated wizards scattered across Europe. Magic entered a dark age, from which it emerged with the foundation of the Order of Hermes, more than three centuries later.

<span id="the-foundation-of-the-order"></span>
== The Foundation of the Order ==

The Order of Hermes owes its existence to Bonisagus, without question the greatest magical genius yet to live. He made two great discoveries, either of which alone would have ensured his place in magical history. The first was the discovery of the Parma Magica, which defended a wizard from the magic of others and shielded him from the antipathetic effect of their Gifts. Safe behind a Parma Magica, a wizard could talk to another Gifted individual with little fear of attack and without having to constantly fight the natural tendency to lapse into envy, suspicion, and hostility.

The true potential of the Parma Magica was first recognized by the sorceress Trianoma, who willingly studied under Bonisagus despite her own power. She realized that the Parma Magica would make a true society of magi possible, a society where wizards could meet to resolve their differences, and live and work together. Bonisagus, already working on his next project, a unified theory of magic, was happy to go along with Trianoma's grand vision.

<span id="trianoma--vica"></span>
== Trianoma &amp; Vica ==

Trianoma had a twin sister, Viea. They were trained in magic together, and as they grew, Viea interpreted Trianoma's visions. One of these visions suggested that the isolated magi of Europe would bring about a disaster, unless the sisters could defeat a particular powerful wizard. They searched for this wizard for years, and finally a dragon, said to be in the temple of the Hesperides beyond Ethiopia, told them to seek out a cave in the Alps.

That wizard was Bonisagus. The Parma Magica protected him from their assault, and he captured them, demanding that they taught him their magic, while he taught them in return. Viea refused, but Trianoma agreed, hoping to use the opportunity to defeat Bonisagus. As they studied together, however, she came to have great respect for him. Viea became increasingly jealous, and after a particularly violent fight with her sister, she stole some valuable texts and fled. Trianoma forbade Bonisagus to seek vengeance, realizing that her vision might have meant that she would fight her sister and bring about the disaster. Instead, she proposed founding an order of magi within which such theft would be forbidden.

Viea's fate remains unknown.

Trianoma traveled across Europe, seeking out the most powerful wizards. The Parma Magica made her immune to their attempts to drive her off, and her demonstrations of her offensive power left many in no doubt that she could, if she wished, eliminate any wizard without fear of consequences. Some ran and hid, hoping to avoid her nefarious plans. Others listened to her dream of a unified order, and agreed to meet with Bonisagus.

From these discussions, Bonisagus drew a great deal of knowledge. From the traditions of the Cult of Mercury he developed Formulaic and Ritual Magic, and from the traditions of the druids, brought by Diedne, a woman cast out from that religion, he learned to create magical effects spontaneously. Verditius taught him the secrets of binding magic into items, and Merinita the arts of binding animals.

From each of the eleven wizards who came to him, Bonisagus learned something, and to each he taught the Parma Magica. The result of these studies was Bonisagus's second great discovery, the theory of Hermetic Magic. In 767 the thirteen wizards gathered at Durenmar in the Black Forest, and swore to the Code of Hermes, creating the Order of Hermes at the first Tribunal.

<span id="the-houses-of-hermes"></span>
== The houses of hermes ==

The first magi of the Order are always referred to as the Twelve Founders, for all that there were thirteen magi at the first Tribunal. Trianoma refused to put herself on an equal footing with Bonisagus, or the other magi she had brought to him, an astute political move that left her free to mediate power struggles rather than being drawn into them. Each of the Twelve Founders established a House. The current House Ex Miscellanea was founded later in the Order's history, and in the beginning House Diedne made up the complement. House Diedne were bound together by their adherence to an ancient pagan religion, which they soon came to dominate completely.

The Order immediately entered a period of rapid growth. The founders of the True Lineages recruited apprentices, and their Houses grew organically. The founders of the Mystery Cults initiated more members, recruiting eagerly from among those other wizards who seemed congenial. House Merinita was not yet a Mystery Cult, and recruited magi with an interest in the wilderness. House Diedne sought converts to its religion. House Jerbiton extended the reach of the Order into the higher culture of the mundane world, even making overtures to Charlemagne himself. And the magi of Houses Flambeau and Tytalus criss-crossed the continent, giving all magicians they found a simple choice: Join, or Die.

Within forty years the Order of Hermes dominated the magical landscape of Europe.

<span id="crises-in-the-order"></span>
== Crises in the Order ==

That domination persists until the present day, 1220. Nevertheless, an Order that has endured for well over four hundred years has naturally faced its share of crises and problems.

<span id="damhan-allaidh-and-the-ordo-miscellanea"></span>
== Damhan-Allaidh and the Ordo Miscellanea ==

In the early years of the ninth century Damhan-Allaidh (DAH-van ALL-ath), a powerful and evil wizard resident in the British Isles, led an organized resistance to the Order of Hermes. Rather than face Hermetic wizards in magical combat, his followers cursed and harassed their followers, set traps, and used mundane assassins to halt the progress of the Order. For a number of years these tactics were effective, and some began to think that the Order would be stopped at the English Channel.

Tytalus the Founder entrusted Pralix, his most gifted apprentice, with the task of defeating Damhan-Allaidh. She brought as much cunning to the task as her opponent, and in a series of devious raids and spectacular magical battles she was able to defeat Damhan-Allaidh and bring many of his followers over to her side. Despite the victory, rumors persist to the present day that Damhan-Allaidh was not destroyed, and still plots revenge against the Order.

As the Order prepared to welcome the victor home, it received a message. Pralix had established her own Order, the Ordo Miscellanea, which would serve as a competitor to the Order of Hermes, keeping it strong. Flambeau wanted to march against her immediately, but Tytalus, impressed by his filia's nerve, forced a negotiated settlement. In 817 the Ordo Miscellanea joined the Order of Hermes as a thirteenth House, House Ex Miscellanea.

<span id="the-domination-of-house-tremere"></span>
== The Domination of house Tremere ==

House Tremere had been slowly building its power since the foundation of the Order, with Tremere himself keeping close control over his line. Through the careful use of certamen and the building of political alliances, the House gained effective control over several Tribunals, and was poised to take over more. When Jerbiton died, leaving Tremere as the sole remaining Founder, the House was ready to move to dominate the entire Order, turning it into a tool for their larger plans.

At that point, a group of magi whose identities are still unknown broke the minds of Tremere's closest lieutenants. This event, known as 'the Sundering', also broke the power structures that the House had built, as obligations to those magi and threats posed by them ceased to be a concern. Tremere himself met with the magi responsible for the Sundering, or perhaps their representatives, and some sort of agreement was forged. While Tremere himself died soon afterwards, the House has kept to the agreement, and has never again tried to dominate the Order.

<span id="the-corruption-of-louse-tytalus"></span>
== The Corruption of Louse Tytalus ==

House Tytalus has always sought challenges. In the late tenth century, leaders of the House went too far, seeking to control demons and instead being corrupted by them. They were engaged in a subtle campaign to corrupt the rest of the Order as well when their corruption was uncovered by another Tytalus maga. She alerted the Quaesitores, and the Order turned with great efficiency to purging the diabolists from their midst. The Prima of House Tytalus, Tasgillia, was the most prominent victim, but the House lost many of its members, and never again recovered the relative size it had in the early years. To this day, many magi wonder whether the House has completely escaped this taint.

<span id="the-schism-war"></span>
== The Schism War ==

Just after the turn of the millennium, the Order of Hermes began to descend into anarchy. The corruption of House Tytalus made magi more paranoid about the secret activities of other magi, even without the incitement of The Gift. Magi also became more concerned about attempts to pry into their secrets, and thus rebuffed attempts at investigation. Many disputes reached Tribunal, where the voting was deadlocked as magi refused to get drawn in. In this period, many Tribunals

were inquorate, as magi were reluctant to leave the security of their own covenants.

Magi who felt themselves threatened resorted to Wizards' War, and even to illegal raids on other covenants. The Quaesitores, Redcaps, Bonisagi, and other magi interested in keeping the Order together were stretched too thin, and found that they could not impose order on magi who did not want it.

The anarchy grew, and for a while it looked as though the Order of Hermes would fall to the same threat as the Cult of Mercury before it.

Then House Tremere declared war on House Diedne. The pagans of that House had always been somewhat distant from the rest of the Order, which was, as it always had been, largely Christian. Dark rumors about their religious rites had spread in the wake of the corruption of Tytalus, and few trusted them. When the Primus of House Tremere, Cercistum, accused the Diedne of human sacrifice and called on the Order to help eliminate the diabolists, House Flambeau eagerly joined the battle. Many members of House Jerbiton, who had long been concerned that the Order harbored a pagan cult, also joined in. Members of many Houses stepped forward to join the Tremere, and no-one publicly supported the Diedne.

Seizing the opportunity, the Bonisagi and Quaesitores called an emergency Grand Tribunal, at which the whole of House Diedne was declared Renounced, so that it was the duty of all Hermetic magi to hunt them down and slay them.

The war that followed was bloody and destructive, and wiped the House out. Its leaders, however, were never found, and while the Order hope that their spells killed them, the fear remains that they fled to some magical regio, biding their time and waiting for revenge.

With the destruction of the Diedne, the Schism War came to an end. The Quaesitores had been able to enforce the Code during the final stages of the War, as all members of the Order were theoretically united against a single enemy. The experience of chaos and destruction convinced most magi that they never wanted to see such a thing again, and once again Tribunals were respected, and the rule of law returned to the Order.

Since the Schism War, the Order has existed in a state of relative peace and co-operation. However, by 1220 the last magi who can remember the War have died or passed into Final Twilight, and memories of that terrible time are fading.

<span id="the-houses-of-hermes-1"></span>
= The Houses of Hermes =

he Order of Hermes is divided into twelve Houses, all but Ex Miscellanea descended in some way from one of the Twelve Founders. This section provides a brief

overview of the Houses, but it is important to remember that individuals within a House can vary widely.

The twelve Houses fall into three groups. Four (Bonisagus, Guernicus, Mercere, and Tremere) are true lineages, made up of those trained by someone trained by someone (etc) trained by the founder of the House. It is not possible to join those Houses later. These Houses are described in the supplement Houses of Hermes: True Lineages. Four (Biornaer, Criamon, Merinita, and Verditius) are Mystery Cults, and magi can join those Houses by being initiated into the cult. Such initiations teach the Outer Mystery of the cult, the only cult ability that is not kept largely secret. Their secret Mysteries, and much more detail of the Houses, are detailed in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults. The last four (Ex Miscellanea, Flambeau, Jerbiton, and Tytalus) are gatherings of magi with common interests. It is relatively easy to join these Houses after training, and magi who feel that they do not fit in to their old Houses often do. Ex Miscellanea, in particular, will take anyone with The Gift, a smattering of Latin and Magic Theory, and the ability to raise a Parma Magica — and many members will teach the last three to potential recruits. The interests and activities of these Houses are discussed in Houses of Hermes: Societates.

It is only possible to be a member of one House at a time.

<span id="house-biomaer"></span>
=== '''house Biomaer''' ===

Magi of Bjornaer (BYORE-nayr) concern themselves primarily with beasts and the animalistic side of human nature. Because of this emphasis in their training, each Bjornaer magus can take the form of an animal, known as his &quot;heartbeast.&quot; Understanding the heartbeast in particular and animals in general is considered more important than Hermetic magic by many in this House. Despite this close association with shapeshifting, Bjornaer magi avoid any kind of shapeshifting other than their heartbeast, and have hostile relations with some other shapeshifters, for reasons that other magi do not fully understand.

Due to their nature, Bjornaer magi are unable to forge the necessary links to have a familiar, and the very concept is alien to them. Some Bjornaer deride magi who take familiars, which they call &quot;substitute&quot; heartbeasts. On the other hand, other magi are wary of followers of Bjornaer because of their fascination with the bestial. Furthermore, House Bjornaer is less respected than it might otherwise be because its founder was from a Germanic rather than a Roman magical tradition.

The House is divided into six clans. Clan Arelie is concerned with remembering the past, Clan Ilfetu is responsible for Initiating members of the House, Clan Maruhs seeks selfrealization, Clan Midusulf leads, Clan Sirnas protects, and Clan Wilkis nurtures magi and strengthens the House. Philosophically, the House is divided between Harmonists, who want to see humans and nature live in harmony, and Wilderists, who want to drive humans back to the cities, restoring the wilderness to its dominance. The Wilderist philosophy was the original philosophy of the House, while the first Harmonist was Hérisson, a magus of the tenth century whose ideas only became popular after the Schism War.

The Prima of the House is Falke, and its domus magna is Crintera, in the Rhine Tribunal, described in ''Guardians of the Forests'', page 92. The former Primus, Archmagus Urgen, is the chief of Clan Midusulf, and still important in the House, sitting on its council and residing at Crintera.

This House is a Mystery Cult, and the ability to take the form of the heartbeast is the Outer Mystery (see page 233).

<span id="house-bonisagus"></span>
== house Bonisagus ==

House Bonisagus is split into two strands, the political and the theoretical. Theoretical Bonisagus magi concentrate on pushing back the boundaries of Hermetic magic, and are the undisputed masters of Magic Theory. Political Bonisagus magi, often called 'magi Trianomae', concentrate on keeping the Order together, and excel at politics.

The current Prima is Archmaga Murion, a consummate politician, who resides at Durenmar in the Rhine Tribunal (see Guardians of the Forests, page 51). The House typically remembers its researchers better than its politicians: figures such as Notatus, the first Primus, who created the Aegis of the Hearth, and Conciatta, who extended Hermetic magic to directly affect the other supernatural powers (Divine, Faerie, and Infernal) (see Legends of Hermes, Chapter Two). Among contemporary members, Archmagus Relisius is well-known for his Christian faith and advocacy of harmony between Magic and the Divine (see Tales of Power, Chapter Four: Encroaching Dominion).

<span id="louse-oriamon"></span>
=== Louse Oriamon ===

This very secretive House is known for its obscure philosophy, its disdain for simple power, and its members' habit of marking their faces and bodies with arcane symbols. Followers of Criamon (KREE-ah-mone) are an enigmatic and\notherworldly group of magi, generally having little interest in the politics of the Order.

Magi of Criamon seek the &quot;Enigma&quot;, which other magi characterize as some sort of mystical experience. For followers of Criamon, understanding the Enigma is about releasing all souls from some sort of imprisonment. Their philosophy is inspired by the ancient Greek thinker Empedocles, and has something to do with the nature of time. They have a unique perspective on right and wrong action, but those outside the House find it very difficult to understand this. Indeed, magi outside the House often stereotype them as tattooed weirdos whose actions make no sense.

Even among the Mystery Cults, House Criamon is difficult for outsiders to comprehend.

Its Prima is Muscaria, who is resident at the domus magna, the Cave of Twisting Shadows in the Tribunal of the Greater Alps. She is a young and intensely practical maga, little like the common image of her House. Important past magi include Vederis, who wrote the Travels of Fedoso, an allegorical, or at least esoteric, text that is popular in the House and beyond, and Abdkypris, who found important links between the Mysteries of the House and the beliefs of the Sufis, a tradition within Islam. St Nerius (see Realms of Power: The Divine &quot;Revised Edition&quot;, page 91), a magus famous for his Christian devotion and sanctity, is generally said to have been a member of House Criamon.

This House is a Mystery Cult, and the Mystery at the heart of the cult is the Enigma (see page 233).

<span id="douse-ox-miscellanea"></span>
=== Douse Ox Miscellanea ===

This is a large, diverse, and highly disorganized collection of magi. Though originally founded by Pralix as a rival to the Order of Hermes, this association was accepted as a House of its own. It accepts wizards of all kinds, some only nominally Hermetic, whose magic comes from many disparate traditions. Magi Ex Miscellanea (EKS mis-kel-LAH-nay-ah) are often called hedge wizards by their many detractors

Magi of Ex Miscellanea have very little in common, belonging to many different traditions within the House, each tradition having its own strengths and weaknesses. Many of these traditions are described in more detail in Houses of Hermes: Societates.

within the Order, although most can

use Hermetic magic just as well as any

other magus.

The Primus of the House is Ebroin, a relatively young magus who was elected four years ago when the previous Prima, Immanola, was declared to have entered Final Twilight. He has ambitions to revitalize the House from its domus magna of Cad Gadu, in the Stonehenge Tribunal.

One of Pralix's closest allies was Colomen, from a tradition of warding wizards now known as the &quot;Columbae&quot;, or &quot;pigeons&quot;. He taught his tradition's magic to other magi, and those insights formed the basis of most of the wards created by Hermetic magic.

Most magi would be hard-pressed to name any magus Ex Miscellanea they did not know personally including most members of the House.

<span id="house-plambeau"></span>
== house Plambeau ==

of fire, while his apprentice, and the first Primus, Apromor, favored Perdo. Thus, both of these traditions are respected within the House. These aggressive and ferocious magi often cause trouble within the Order and frequently anger mundanes. However, their fearlessness and love of destruction make them invaluable when the Order requires the

application of martial force.

House Flambeau is a gathering of kindred spirits. While most followers of Flambeau believe in direct action and combat, there is also a strong tradition of honor and chivalry in the House, making them in many ways the Order's knights. This is particularly true under the current Primus, Garus, who leads the House from its domus magna of Castra Solis in the Provençal Tribunal (see Faith &amp; Flame, page 67). The House's original domus magna was Val Negra, also in the Provençal Tribunal, but it has been lost in a regio for decades, if not centuries. Flambeau's second apprentice, Elaine, carried on his tradition of fire magic, and served as a Hoplite (see House Guernicus, next). She was also an important scholar and author, and wrote several texts that are still important today, including Ars Flambonis, a summa on Ignem (level 14, quality 12) that is peppered with anecdotes of the Founder and particularly popular within the House.

Among its contemporary members, the Archmaga Geirlaug of Montverte covenant in the Normandy Tribunal is particularly notable, as much for her great age as her great power. She is rarely seen outside her tower these days, but is a master of Ignem and still has a firm grip on the direction of her covenant (see The Lion and The Lily, page 58).

<span id="house-guernicus"></span>
== house Guernicus ==

House Guernicus (GWAIR-nee-kuss) is a true lineage, all its members descended from Guernicus the Founder, who believed that the Order needed strictly enforced rules if it was to survive. Members of this House are the judges of the Order, investigating wrongdoing and bringing cases against those who transgress the Code of Hermes and the Peripheral Code. They believe the Order will collapse through internal conflict without their fierce stewardship. The House is sometimes known informally as House Quaesitor (KWAE-see-tor), as 'Quaesitor' is the title of those magi empowered by the Order to investigate crimes

Although House Guernicus trains and inducts their own apprentices, other magi can also join the ranks of the Quaesitores, and one of the highest honors in the Order is to be invited by the elders of House Guernicus to become a Quaesitor. Such magi invariably retain membership in their original House. A starting maga can only be a Quaesitor if she was trained in House Guernicus.

Quaesitors are sometimes asked to investigate possible crimes, or to mediate disputes between magi or covenants. While this does take time, the custom of the Order is that the Quaesitors be given a few pawns of vis as a gift, in return for their efforts. These investigators are often supported by magi known as Hoplites, who are often from other Houses. Hoplites are skilled in defeating the things that might threaten a Quaesitor, which means that they are strong in magical combat.

The House has an important philosophical split between Traditionalists, who believe that the Code should be preserved as it has been since the Founding, and the Transitionalists, who believe that it should be revised to better suit modern realities. The Transitionalist movement started with Simprim of Guernicus in the mid-twelfth century, and seeks greater legal powers for the Quaesitores.

The Prima of the House is the Archmaga Bilera, a maga with a long history of fine service to the House and, importantly, a largely neutral stance on the Traditionalist/ Transitionalist debate. She resides at the domus magna of the House, Magvillus, in the Roman Tribunal. Guernicus himself was a master of earth magics, and taught Bonisagus much of the knowledge incorporated into the Hermetic Art of Terram. A tradition of such magic remains in the House, and its most famous living representative is Ausculator, the leader of the covenant of Hedvosmos in the Theban Tribunal. Hedyosmos is located in a labyrinth of caves, and is rumored to possess a portal to the underworld, something that would be very appropriate to the tradition (see The Sundered Eagle, page 66).

<span id="house-terbiton"></span>
=== house Terbiton ===

House Jerbiton (YARE-bih-tahn) is interested in the arts and the mundane world, and sometimes assumes the duty of keeping the Order on good terms with the nobility and Church. This inclination in its members often stems from a noble background—apprentices are sometimes taken from the aristocracy, and these magi maintain ties afterwards. Other members are taken from skilled artists and craftsmen who have The Gift. The Gentle Gift (page 82) is particularly common in this House.

Many members of other Houses believe that followers of lerbiton are too closely bound to the mundane powers to be trusted. On the other hand, Jerbiton magi fear that members of the Order have become isolated from humanity, risking bloody conflict with the mundanes. They try energetically to heal this rift, and pursue aesthetic and Classical knowledge with a passion. The fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204 has inspired the Primus, Andru, to rally the House to its original values, the defense of civilization, a call that the younger generation of magi have heeded. The domus magna of House Jerbiton is Valnastium, in the Tribunal of the Greater Alps. Two historically

important Primi were Petrus, in the tenth century, who advocated life within mundane communities, and Mattieus, in the twelfth, who believed that Jerbiton should live with other magi and serve as their ambassadors to the mundanes. These two philosophies remain strong within the House.

Members of House Jerbiton are trained in mundane study, the arts, and politics, and the House is held together by these common interests. The House is not tightly organized. and its magi group themselves into leagues based on a common interest. A maga may join many leagues, to find companionship with other magi who share her interests. Examples of leagues include The Gastronomers. who cooperate to hold a lavish party every year (this is a very popular league, and has members from other Houses), The Silent Ones, who are led by a magus of House Bonisagus and seek to remove the need for words and gestures from Hermetic magic, and The Humble Brethren, who work to subtly influence the College of Cardinals and ensure that no one with strong anti-magic opinions is elected Pope.

Fortunata of Jerbiton was a powerful spirit master of the eleventh century who defeated many non-Hermetic enemies and gathered knowledge and power from many Mysteries. She was forced into exile by Hermetic enemies, and disappeared into Final Twilight shortly after 1120. Her writings are rumored to contain information on how to gain the power that she had (see Legends of Hermes, Chapter Three for more information).

In the present, Archmagus Mathieus of Constantinople, who is named for the city where he was trained but has lived in Paris for many years, is known for having given up the study of magic as not worth his time. For many years he seemed to have no purpose in life, but since the fall of Constantinople he has become much more active (see The Lion and the Lily, page 87). Archmagus Edward of Milton, on the other hand, is famed for heading the covenant of Schola Pythagoranis in Cambridge, which claims to have served as the nucleus for the new university in that town (see Art and Academe, page 112).

<span id="house-mercere"></span>
=== house Mercere ===

The founder of this House lost his magical powers but remained involved in the Order. He assumed a non-magical role valuable to\nother magi — that of messenger. His followers continue to fulfill that role. All members of House Mercere (mareKAY-ray, or mare-SARE in vulgar Latin), regardless of whether they possess The Gift, are officially recognized as magi of the Order. Even\nun Gifted Mercere spend 15 years in apprenticeship like other magi.

Followers of Mercere are more commonly known as Redcaps because of the headgear they wear as a badge of office. Redcaps are permitted to attend Hermetic Tribunals, but by convention they only vote if they have The Gift. Some unGifted Mercere have powerful supernatural abilities, which are generally attributed to descent from the heroes of classical myth. Whatever the truth of that, these Redcaps are particularly respected within the House.

House Mercere is a true lineage. Mercere trained two apprentices before he lost his Gift, and thus there is a small Gifted tradition in this House, which is composed almost entirely of blood descendants of Mercere. Many magi of this House have had a strong interest in the magic of the ancient Cult of Mercury.

The most famous member of House Mercere, apart from the Founder himself, is Belin, Mercere's last apprentice. She was renowned for her devotion to the Order and her dedication to getting messages to their destination, and despite having no Gift she is, even today, held up as an ideal in the House.

The Prima of House Mercere is Insatella, an unGifted Redcap who inherited the role from her father and skillfully manages the affairs of all Mercere from the domus magna at Harco, in the Roman Tribunal. As she does not have The Gift, she tries to stay out of Hermetic politics as far as possible, thus reinforcing the House's reputation for neutrality.

<span id="louse-merinita"></span>
== '''Louse Merinita''' ==

This House is focused on the world of faeries, and its members tend to be just as strange as the creatures they study. Merinita (meh-rih-NEE-tah) magi frequently remain isolated, having little to do with the rest of the Order, except to defend faeries from the assaults of other magi. Those of this House eschew the merely mortal, and seek answers within the mysterious world of Arcadia.

Although the House was founded by Merinita, she herself was not particularly interested in faeries. This was the work of her first apprentice, Quendalon, who had been raised among faeries and had always believed that they had much to offer. Merinita disappeared at the end of the eighth century, and soon after Quendalon announced that he was going to study with the faeries, leaving Merinita's second apprentice, Myanar, in charge of the House.

Quendalon returned two years later, his eyes replaced by rubies, and announced a new direction for the House. This was resisted by Myanar, and war broke out within the House. Ultimately, Quendalon was victorious, and the Merinita turned to the study of faerie. Quendalon served as Primus, at least in name, until the end of the tenth century, although he had little contact with his House in the latter half of that century. Some magi even now suspect that the returned Quendalon was actually a faerie.

The current Primus is Handri, who lives at the domus magna of Irencillia in the Rhine Tribunal. The previous Prima, Vinaria, also lives there. In 1202, she vanished much as Quendalon had done, leaving Handri in charge. However, when Vinaria returned in 1209, she made no moves to regain control of the House, and still lives quietly at Irencillia (see ''Guardians of the Forests'', page 104).

Lucian the Scholar is an elder magus who lives in the covenant of Aegea, on the floor of the Aegean Sea in the Theban Tribunal. He is renowned for his deep knowledge of the literary traditions of the Byzantine Empire and ancient Greece, and is rumored to have been Initiated into secrets of story magic (see ''The Sundered Eagle'', page 81). Dama, the Praeco of the Provençal Tribunal, was born in 993. She fell into Twilight in 1061, but emerged 19 years later, and remains active today. She is one of only two members of the covenant of Mimizan, and is rumored to lead a Mystery Cult that is not part of House Merinita (see ''Faith &amp; Flame'', pages 29 and 64).

House Merinita is a Mystery Cult, and magi of Merinita are all initiated into the Outer Mystery of Faerie Magic (see page 236).

<span id="house-tremere"></span>
=== house Tremere ===

Members of House Tremere (tray-MARE-ay or tray-MARE) emphasize the importance of judgment, strategy, and detailed planning. They believe in respect for superiors and in asserting authority over minions. Dignity is of the utmost concern.

House Tremere is considered one of the more sensible and stable Houses, providing strength and courage when needed and refraining from action when peace better serves the Order.

House Tremere is a true lineage. All of its members can trace a chain back through their masters and their masters' masters, and so on, back to Tremere the Founder. It is not possible to join the House from outside. Certamen, a safe method of magical dueling between magi, was invented by Tremere the Founder, and his House retains a great deal of interest in it.

In addition, Tremere magi hold their filii's voting sigils (see page 314) until the filius beats the parens in certamen, or until the parens dies. If a Tremere magus who does not hold his own sigil trains an apprentice, the new magus' sigil is held by the parens of the training magus, assuming that that magus holds his own sigil. If he does not, the sigil is passed back up the chain until it reaches a magus who does

hold his own sigil. As a result of this custom, House Tremere's votes are concentrated in a very limited number of hands.

The domus magna is Coeris, in the Transylvanian Tribunal, and the Prima is Poena. She is said to know the names, magical strengths, and preferences of every member of her House, and of any other magus she thinks may be of use. Whatever the truth of that, she certainly manages the projects of the whole House with unusual efficiency (see Against the Dark, page 21). The House's second-in-command (unlike other Houses, Tremere actually has such a post) is Archmaga Monica Ierne, a maga originally from the Stonehenge Tribunal and a master of combat magic. She is unsuited to the post of Prima, and has publicly acknowledged this, but she is an excellent field commander (see Against the Dark, page 30). Archmagus Stentorius is exactly what other magi think of when they imagine an older, powerful member of House Tremere. He is the leader of Fengheld, the largest covenant in the Rhine Tribunal, and holds three-fifths of the sigils of the Tremere magi of that Tribunal, as well as commanding the House there. Even in a Tribunal that holds the domus magnae and Primi of Houses Bonisagus, Bjornaer, and Merinita, he may hold more political power than any other individual magus or maga (see Guardians of the Forests, page 84).

<span id="house-tutalus"></span>
=== house Tutalus ===

The philosophy of Tytalus (TIE-tah-loos) magi is to master all forms of conflict. To this end, they promote innovation in all sorts of contests. They do not feel alive unless they are in a constant state of struggle, perpetually testing the strengths and weaknesses of others.

House Tytalus is almost the opposite of House Tremere. Where the Tremere believe in stability and respect for elders, Tytalus magi believe in constant change, and in challenging your elders repeatedly until you can finally win. The Founders of the two Houses were trained by the same wizard, Guorna the Fetid, and often fought over their contrasting visions of how to live.

In their never-ending search for conflict, the leaders of House Tytalus went too far in the 10th century, falling prey to demonic machinations. Those masters of intrigue arrogantly believed they could master the dark forces, but despite their skill, were unable to outwit Hell. The leaders were executed for their crime of diabolism, and House Tytalus has been distrusted ever since. This has not been helped by the fact that two magi, Buliste and Harpax, both claim to be Primus (or Prima, in Buliste's case). Buliste was the ninth Prima, but passed into Twilight. Harpax then claimed the right to be tenth Primus. However, Buliste emerged from Twilight, and refused to acknowledge his position; he, of course, refused to yield. The two are still fighting for control of the House, and of its domus magna, Fudarus, in the Normandy Tribunal (see The Lion and the Lily, page 41). The magi of House Tytalus choose sides, but most of them seem to do so simply for the sake of the challenge, and not because they have any real loyalty to one or the other.

<span id="louse-verditius"></span>
== '''Louse Verditius''' ==

Magi of House Verditius (ware-DEE-tee-oos) have unsurpassed skill at creating enchanted items, making them invaluable to other magi and non-Gifted persons.

Almost all, unfortunately, have also inherited their founder's magical Flaw, making them unable to cast Formulaic spells without the aid of casting tools. Followers of Verditius are sometimes considered inferior to other magi because of this weakness. They do not measure themselves by this standard, however, seeing themselves as superior to other magi — this hubris is a side effect of the Inner Mysteries of their House.

While the Code forbids magi to sell enchanted items to mundanes, the mundane employees of magi may do so, and almost all magi of this House have such associates, known as venditores. The magi sell items directly to other magi, of course, and can become wealthy in both magical and mundane terms.

Magi of House Verditius often become involved in vendettas with other magi of their House, antagonizing each other until one admits that the other is superior. As that is rare, vendettas tend to last a long time. The House believes that such contests are honorable and admirable, but magi of other Houses may not agree. These vendettas reflect the politically fragmented nature of the House, in which the Primus is the only official position.

Every eighteen years, the House holds a grand Contest, at which enchanted items are judged to determine the best created since the previous Contest. Every magus of the House is allowed to enter a single item, and many magi spend years preparing their entries.

The Primus of House Verditius is chosen by strict primogeniture: the eldest living filius of the previous Primus becomes Primus. There is almost no opposition to this in the House, as most magi do not care who their Primus is, and appreciate a system that means they need not worry about choosing a new one. The current Primus is Stouritus, who does not live at the domus magna of Verdi in the Roman Tribunal. He is a member of the covenant of Ingasia in the Theban Tribunal, and would like it to become the domus magna so that there would be no need for him to move (see ''The Sundered Eagle'', page 86).

House Verditius is a Mystery Cult, and all members are initiated into the Outer Mystery of Verditius Magic (See page 240).

<span id="covenants"></span>
== Covenants ==

ovenants are as important to the Order of Hermes as Houses, and magi can, and do, spend hours debating which is more important in the end.

Strictly speaking, a covenant is any group of magi who agree to a set of rules that go beyond the Code of Hermes, and that allow them to share resources and co-operate more easily. In the overwhelming majority of cases, covenants are formed by magi who want to live in the same place, sharing access to a Magic aura, buildings, and servants. Thus, the term 'covenant' has come to refer to a place where a number of magi live together, as well as to the group of magi making the agreement.

A typical covenant has about half a dozen magi as members, but they range from two magi to large organizations with over two dozen magi and hundreds of mundane staff. Most Ars Magica sagas center around a single covenant, and ensuring that the covenant prospers is as important as individual advancement. After all, characters belonging to a well-supplied covenant will advance more quickly than those who must rely on their own resources.

The physical form of covenants varies, but towers and castles are common. In addition, covenants are normally located some distance from major mundane settlements, in large part because that is where most Magic auras are found.

<span id="the-gode-of-hermes"></span>
= The Gode of Hermes =

he foundation of the Order of Hermes as an organization is the Code of Hermes. This short text, also called the Hermetic Oath because all members of the Order

recite and swear to it when they are admitted, sets the structure of the Order and fixes certain limits on what its members may do. It was drafted to give magi as much freedom as possible, while protecting them from each other.

The degree to which magi obey the Oath varies from magus to magus, covenant to covenant, and Tribunal to Tribunal. Magi who violate the Oath and get caught, however, usually find themselves in trouble with their Tribunal.

The Code of Hermes, first sworn by Bonisagus, can be found on the next page. Since he was the first to swear it, his name is recorded whenever it is written down. There is a slight difference between the Code that members of House Bonisagus swear and the Code that members of other Houses swear. The difference is marked.

<span id="the-peripheral-gode"></span>
== The Peripheral Gode ==

he Peripheral Code consists of all decisions made in Tribunal since the foundation of the Order. Its formal authority derives from the clause in the Code requiring magi

to abide by the decisions made at Tribunal, but as every case is different later Tribunals are not bound by the decisions of earlier Tribunals. Indeed, there are contradictory precedents throughout the Peripheral Code, and few magi outside the Quaesitores are familiar with all of its details. Some points are widely known, however, and worth discussing in this section.

In theory, the only penalty for breaking the Code is death. In practice, Tribunals only rarely impose that, instead settling for vis fines, time spent in service, or other lesser punishments. These punishments are backed up by the ultimate sanction, however, and refusing to submit to the punishment imposed by a Tribunal is always taken as reason for the death penalty. This is enforced by declaring a Wizard's March, which casts the offender from the Order and thus deprives him of the Code's protection. This is called 'Renouncing', and magi subject to a Wizard's March are known as 'renounced magi'. Since the criminal's possessions are, by tradition, granted to those who kill him, powerful magi are often interested in helping to hunt down the offenders.

Much more information about the Peripheral Code and its enforcement can be found in ''Houses'' of ''Hermes: True Lineages'', starting from page 45.

I will not slay nor attempt to slay any member of the Order, except in justly executed and formally declared Wizards' War.

''II''

<span id="depriving-of-magical-power"></span>
== Depriving of Magical Power ==

This clause is often invoked to punish actions against a magus that fall short of physical harm, such as damaging his laboratory or killing grogs. The justification is that, by depriving a magus of the resources he needs to study, the miscreant is depriving him of some of the magical power he would otherwise enjoy. The core meaning of the clause, though, is that magi must not try to damage each other's Gift.

<span id="wizards-war"></span>
== Wizards' War ==

The Code allows for a conflict between two magi to escalate to open conflict in certain conditions. When those conditions are met, the two magi involved may step outside the bounds of the Code temporarily to settle their differences. One magus initiates a Wizards' War by sending a declaration of war to the other. The message must arrive on the next night of the full moon. The war then begins on the rise of the following full moon, and lasts until the rise of the next full moon after that.

Unjust or constant use of Wizards' War is discouraged by the majority of level-headed magi. Occasionally, those who declare war too often find themselves victims of a Wizard's March.

<span id="tribunals"></span>
== Tribunals ==

Tribunals are central to the political life of the Order, as was always Trianoma's intent, and thus they are discussed in detail in their own section, below. This clause is vital, however, as it gives Tribunals some authority to make new rules and interpret the clauses of the Code to fit changing situations.

<span id="interfering-with-mundanes"></span>
== Interfering with Mundanes ==

The clause forbidding interference with mundanes is probably the most controversial clause in the Code. Covenants have to deal with mundanes repeatedly in order to exist, and fortified dwellings containing substantial numbers of warriors tend to draw the attention of local nobles. As a result, the second half of the sentence, 'and thereby bring ruin on my sodales', is brought into most debates. As long as dealings with mundanes do not harm other magi, nor seem likely to cause such harm, they are permitted. Many precedents, however, have established that working as a court wizard is a violation of the Code.

<span id="dealing-with-demons"></span>
== Dealing with Demons ==

The Order hunts down and kills any member found dealing with demons. This is the only clause enforced absolutely. Trying to destroy demons is normally acceptable, but even then drawing a demon's attention to the Order is frowned upon.

<span id="molesting-the-faeries"></span>
== Molesting the Faeries ==

Interpretation of this clause rests heavily on what counts as molestation. Faerie places are good vis sources, so few magi have been willing to argue that charging into a faerie area spells blazing, stealing large amounts of faerie property, and retreating to your covenant, counts as molestation. This has made it rather difficult to say what is, and prosecutions under this clause tend to come down to politics, and whether other magi have suffered. Unlike the mundane and demonic clauses, however, it does not prohibit friendly dealings with faeries, at any level.

<span id="magical-creatures"></span>
== Magical Creatures ==

Notably missing from the Code is a clause granting protection to magical creatures or other wizards. This was deliberate, as Trianoma wanted the Order to be able to use force to compel people to join. Excessive interference with powerful magical beings, however, can still fall under 'endangering the Order by my actions'.

<span id="scrying"></span>
== Scrying ==

This prohibition is enforced with surprising rigor. Tribunals have ruled that it is illegal to scry on a non-magus, if by so doing you learn about the magus's activities, that simply walking around invisible is magical scrying, and that you can be punished for using Intellego magic on a magus even if you didn't know that he was a magus. There are also contrary rulings on many of these points, but in general Tribunals have taken a very strict view of what constitutes magical scrying.

<span id="apprentices"></span>
== Apprentices ==

By contrast, the clause on apprentices is hardly enforced at all. Magi do not have to train apprentices, and the obligation on the parens to join a Wizard's March against his filius is treated more as a social expectation than a legal duty.

The special right of Bonisagus magi to take apprentices from other magi is upheld, however, as is the duty of Bonisagus magi to share their work.

<span id="tribunals-1"></span>
== Tribunals ==

n fo

n origin, a Tribunal was any formal gathering of magi that made decisions by a majority vote of those present, and kept a record of those decisions. As the Order

grew, however, the Peripheral Code rapidly provided more definition. The Tribunals of the Order are now the Grand Tribunal, and any other Tribunals formally established by it. In 1220, the regional Tribunals are the only ones so established.

A legal Tribunal must be attended, in person, by at least twelve magi from at least four different covenants. There must be one Quaesitor present to oversee the legality of the proceedings, and while the Quaesitor does not vote, he does count towards the quorum. Magi may vote by proxy, giving their voting sigils to someone who is attending on their behalf, who may or may not be required to use them in a certain way, depending on the agreement with the person granting the sigil.

The Tribunal is chaired by the

Praeco, the oldest magus present,

the power to choose the order of business and, in extreme circumstances, silence a magus or eject him from the Tribunal. If the ejections render the Tribunal inquorate, or deprive it of a presiding Quaesitor, the Tribunal ceases to be valid. At the end of the Tribunal, the presiding Quaesitor must certify it as valid, and this is the main check on the Praeco abusing his power.

<span id="the-grand-tribunal"></span>
== The Grand Tribunal ==

The most important Tribunal of the Order is the Grand Tribunal, held every 33 years and drawing magi from the whole Order. The Grand Tribunal is always held at Durenmar, the domus magna of House Bonisagus and the birthplace of the Order. Three representatives are sent from each of the regional Tribunals (see later), and the Primi of all Houses also attend. The Primus of House Bonisagus serves as Praeco, even if older magi are present, and the Primus of House Guernicus as Presiding Quaesitor.

The Grand Tribunal discusses matters affecting the whole Order, and its decisions are generally given far more weight than the decisions of lesser Tribunals. In addition, it is the only Tribunal with authority over the whole Order, and thus

the forum where inter-Tribunal

and while he also cannot vote, except to break ties, he does have

<span id="regional-tribunals"></span>
== Regional Tribunals ==

Each regional Tribunal is composed, in theory, of all the magi living in a certain area of Europe. These areas are roughly fixed by Grand Tribunal decisions, but the magi in them can change the name of the Tribunal at will, and set the membership requirements freely. In general, you don't change Tribunals if you visit a covenant in a different Tribunal, and different Tribunals might have different rules on just how long a visit can be. Regional Tribunals meet once every seven years, and the Redcaps are required to ensure that every magus in the Tribunal has received an invitation. Otherwise, they follow the normal rules for Tribunals.

For the borders and names of the Regional Tribunals, see the map on page 494. Note that the borders are only approximate, as no disputes have yet arisen requiring them to be precisely fixed. Six of the Tribunals have been described in detail in supplements for Ars Magica 5th Edition: Guardians of the Forests (the Rhine Tribunal), The Lion and the Lily (the Normandy Tribunal), The Sundered Eagle (the Theban Tribunal), Against the Dark (the Transylvanian Tribunal), The Contested Isle (the Hibernian Tribunal), and Faith &amp; Flame (the Provençal Tribunal).

<span id="the-order-and-society"></span>
= The Order and Society =

ost Hermetic magi want society to leave them alone to get on with their research, and in return they are perfectly happy to leave society alone. Life is, of course,

not that simple, and magi are often forced to interact with many parts of society. Some even want to do so.

<span id="peasants"></span>
== Peasants ==

Most peasants are afraid of magi, and stay away from their covenants. This fear is generally reasonable, as covenants are almost invariably founded in Magical areas, where strange and dangerous things happen. Further, magi themselves, due to The Gift and their ability to turn people into frogs, tend to inspire fear in the uneducated. Local legends may grow up around a covenant, and older legends or legends from distant places may be attached to it, giving it a very strange, and largely undeserved, reputation.

On the other hand, a covenant in a remote location which keeps to itself might well be almost unknown among the peasants. They have no particular reason to want to know about it, and there is no reason for them to hear about it. In this case, they are probably still scared of the region, which almost certainly has a Magical aura, but may not even know that there are magi living there.

Most covenants rely on some peasants to grow food, just as the nobility and clergy do. These peasants find the magi creepy, due to The Gift, but are likely to accept them as lords as long as they treat their charges fairly well. Indeed, they might even be seen as better lords than most, as magi can do something about bad weather, plagues, or rampaging dragons. Sensible covenants will have an unGifted official in charge of direct interaction with the peasants, but there is no reason why the local peasants shouldn't feel a certain degree of affection for 'their' wizards, as long as they don't have to deal with them in person too often.

Finally, peasants who don't fit into Mythic European society for whatever reason may seek sanctuary at the covenant. Women who want to be scholars or warriors, serfs who want to be free, and people fleeing the consequences of a single misjudgment are all potential recruits. As a rule, people join a covenant because they have a good reason not to be somewhere else, rather than because they particularly want to live with wizards.

<span id="the-church"></span>
== The Church ==

Relations between the Order and the Church are officially non-existent. The Order is well aware that the Church, with God's backing, could wipe them out with no problem. The Church is well aware that Hermetic magi are very powerful, and that at least some are good Christians. The Order's tendency to harbor heretics draws suspicion, but as long as magi stay out of ecclesiastical affairs, the Church is not willing to take official action.

Individual clergy, however, run the full range of attitudes, from self-righteous certainty that magi are devil worshipers who must be destroyed, to enthusiastic collaboration with them as fellow scholars, albeit scholars with unusual talents. Most covenants try to establish good relations with the local parish clergy, at least, and most succeed at that. Again, using unGifted intermediaries is generally a good idea.

Tribunals tend to treat interfering with the Church as a very serious crime, simply because the Church is the only organization with the potential to wipe out the entire Order. Friendly, or at least neutral, relations are encouraged; magi who launch attacks on the Church can expect to be renounced and Marched before they can inspire a Crusade.

<span id="dobility"></span>
== Dobility ==

Most nobles are aware of the existence of the Order of Hermes, and all local nobles will quickly become aware of a standard covenant, with its castle and armed troops. Most nobles also have some vague recollection that these powerful wizards aren't allowed to swear fealty to them, or serve them as court wizards, and thus they apply a bit more subtlety in trying to forge relationships with their powerful new neighbors.

Again, individual attitudes run the full gamut, from eager, sycophantic fawning in the hope of magical assistance, to outright hostility in the hope of convincing the magi to set up somewhere else, a long way away. Most covenants, again, try to establish good relationships with the local nobility, but many fail to win over everyone, thus leaving a constant rival as a thorn in their side. Few nobles are stupid enough to mount a direct assault on a covenant, and those who are tend to die, but equally any covenant that deliberately wiped out a noble rival would be hauled before Tribunal and Marched, post-haste.

The Peripheral Code has tended to rule that deals with nobles that don't involve service or permanent magical aid are not a violation of the clause against interfering with mundanes. This is only a tendency, though, and covenants with extensive mundane involvement need to pay close attention to their Hermetic relationships as well, lest they find themselves isolated and condemned at Tribunal.

<span id="oities"></span>
== '''Oities''' ==

Most covenants and magi stay away from cities. In a city, The Gift is a major handicap, and most cities have Dominion auras that interfere strongly with magical research. On the other hand, cities contain scholars, merchants, and all kinds of mundane resources, and even simple magic can support an effective trade, so some magi, particularly of House Jerbiton, enjoy living there.

City covenants try to find a Magic aura, ideally a regio, in which they can undertake laboratory work without undue interference, and often offer their services as go-betweens for more remote covenants who want to deal with an urban area. For most magi, however, cities are an interesting place to visit, but they wouldn't want to live there.

<span id="magical-items"></span>
== Magical Items ==

In the early days of the Order, magi were allowed to sell enchanted devices or other magical services to mundanes without restriction, as long as they were never at the beck and call of a mundane. This changed in 1061, with a series of Tribunal rulings making it illegal to accept money or other mundane

goods as payment for arcane services from anyone other than a member of the Order of Hermes or a Hermetic covenant. The rulings also make it clear that any magic sold in this way to a non-magus must eventually lose its power, whether because it is a charged item, or because the effect has a limited duration.

There are two obvious loopholes in this ruling. The first is less important; mundanes can pay with other arcane items, or with vis. Very few mundanes have access to vis, and the Order is quite keen to gather permanent enchanted devices in return for temporary ones. A mundane offered a temporary item which will last for his and his son's lifetime might be quite willing to trade a rather weaker permanent item for it. Trades of this sort are actually encouraged by the Quaesitores, as they take permanent items sold before the ruling out of mundane circulation.

The second loophole is so glaring that it must have been deliberately designed. There is nothing to stop a mundane covenant member from selling an enchanted item on, or, indeed, to stop him from accepting a commission to obtain a particular item. Thus, the main effect has been to stop magi from dealing directly with mundanes.

<span id="other-wizards"></span>
== Other Wizards ==

Hermetic magi may be the most powerful users of magic in Europe, but they are far from the only ones. People with supernatural abilities are much more common than people with The Gift, and not everyone with The Gift becomes a Hermetic magus. The official policy is still that all wizards must join the Order, or die. However, this is rarely enforced, particularly if the wizard in question is weak, or a member of the Church, or a noble.

Powerful, isolated wizards are strongly encouraged to join, and may well be killed if they refuse, but other wizards may merely be threatened with dire consequences if they cause trouble for the Order. Since other wizards have no equivalent of Parma Magica, these threats can easily be backed up.

There is one case in which the 'Join or Die' policy is rigorously enforced. Any non-Hermetic wizard who learns the Parma Magica, or any other form of general magic resistance, must join the Order of Hermes or be hunted down. The Order is virtually unanimous in its opinion that this monopoly must be preserved.

More information about non-Hermetic wizards can be found in ''Hedge Magic Revised Edition'' and ''Rival Magic'', and in the regional sourcebooks for areas outside Mythic Europe: ''The Cradle and the Crescent'', ''Between Sand and Sea'', and ''Lands of the Nile''.

<span id="iii-characters"></span>
== III. Characters ==

<span id="character-types"></span>
== Character Types ==

layer characters in Ars Magica fall into three categories, depending on their role in the story. Magi are members of the Order of Hermes, the powerful wizards around whom

the game centers. Companions are important characters who are not magi, while grogs are minor characters.

Most players of '''Ars Magica''' have at least two characters, and often more, although they do not play all of them at once. The characters to be played depend on events in the saga, and this is discussed in more detail in the section on Troupe-Style Roleplaying, on page 528.

<span id="magi"></span>
== Magi ==

A magus (feminine maga, plural magi, feminine plural magae) is a powerful wizard, even when he has only just finished his training. Magi rule the covenant around which a saga revolves, and have the potential to become as powerful as any human being can. A magus player character belongs to a single player, who has complete control over that character's decisions.

Although magi are very powerful, they are also limited in important ways by The Gift, their ability to work magic (see pages 63 and 203). This means that there are some things that only non-magi can do effectively. In addition, magi are rarely skilled at anything other than magic, which means that they need help in everyday affairs.

<span id="companions"></span>
== Companions ==

A companion is an important non-magus. Like magi, player character companions belong to a single player, who controls that character's decisions. Beyond this, companions have little in common with one another. One might be a knight and veteran of the Crusades, another might be a wandering friar, a third an unGifted Redcap, still another a noblewoman. Because the Order of Hermes stands somewhat outside medieval society, it tends to attract those who do not fit in, so a companion could also be a woman who wants to serve as a knight, a priest who sees supernatural visions and has tipped into heresy, or a werewolf seeking someone who might be able to cure her affliction.

Although each player has a magus and a companion, they are almost never played together, and thus should not be linked to each other. Linking your companion to another player's magus is a good idea, though, as that provides two player characters with a reason to investigate things together. If you do link your companion to another player's magus, your companion should have abilities that complement those of the magus, rather than overlapping.

Companions should generally not have The Gift, unless you intend to play through apprenticeship so that they become magi at some point.

<span id="mythic-companions"></span>
== Mythic Companions ==

You may find, when playing Ars Magica, that you would like to play a character who is comparable in power to a Hermetic magus without actually playing a member of the Order of Hermes. There are many individuals in Mythic Europe who have strange and potent abilities, including non-Hermetic wizards, holy hermits and supernaturally strong warriors. In Ars Magica such characters are referred

collectively as Mythic Companions. While Hermetic magi are normally still the most potent characters in terms of raw power, Mythic Companions approach them. However, as they are not members of the Order of Hermes, they cannot play the same social role in a saga as a magus.

If you wish to play a Mythic Companion, you should normally play it as an alternative to a magus character, though the troupe may disregard this guideline, depending on how your saga is being conducted. The troupe may also decide to not allow Mythic Companions in the saga at all, if they want to focus on a &quot;standard&quot; Hermetic covenant.

General guidelines for Mythic Companions, and some examples, are given at the end of this chapter, and many '''Ars Magica''' supplements include guidelines for further specific types. You may also create your own type of Mythic Companion, in cooperation with the troupe.

<span id="grogs"></span>
== Grogs ==

Grogs are minor characters, often warriors who protect the magi and defend the covenant, but also including specialists such as bookbinders and teachers who are not important enough in the story to be created as companions.

As minor characters, grogs tend to have bad things happen to them. Warrior grogs die defending the magi, other grogs might be possessed by spirits, forced to marry a faerie lord, or die from a disease that threatens the covenant. In most versions of troupe-style play, grogs are played by many different players, and the storyguide sometimes simply tells the players what happened to a grog.

On the other hand, grogs are a great deal of fun to play. You don't need to worry too much about the consequences of your actions, because you probably won't be playing this character next week. You can ham up the acting, and have the grog do something stupidly heroic, or heroically stupid. If a grog charges into lone battle against a dragon, in order to defend a magus, he might die in a couple of rounds, in which case he is remembered fondly, or make some stupendously lucky rolls and kill the dragon, in which case he becomes a hero. With a grog, you can take that risk, while with a companion or magus you will probably want to be more cautious. Of course, it's also fun to play a grog who debates with the magus about the wisdom of staying to face a dragon.

Grogs are often generated from the grog templates, starting on page 31. They may be created by detailed character creation, but should have no Major Virtues or Flaws, and no more than three Minor Flaws, balanced by an equal number of Minor Virtues. In addition, grogs should not have Story Flaws, as they are supposed to be minor characters. Finally, grogs can never have The Gift. A character with The Gift is too important to be a grog.

<span id="character-basics"></span>
== Character Basics ==

This section outlines the way that the game rules describe characters.

<span id="size"></span>
== Size ==

All Ars Magica characters have a Size score. However, almost all adult human characters have the same Size score, 0, as this represents an average adult human. Every three points of Size represents a ten-fold increase or decrease in mass, and adult humans can range from Size -2 to Size +2, if they take appropriate Virtues or Flaws. The effects of this are described in the Virtues chapter, page 61. Size is more important for non-human creatures, and is discussed in detail in the Bestiary chapter, page 426.

<span id="virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== Virtues and Flaws ==

Virtues and Flaws are features of the character that are not shared by most people; special benefits in the case of Virtues, and disadvantages or hooks into stories for Flaws. They cover supernatural abilities, including The Gift, enemies,

aptitudes, as well as much more. All Virtues and Flaws are listed in their own chapter, starting on page 61.

<span id="characteristics"></span>
== Characteristics ==

There are eight Characteristics in Ars Magica, each representing one of a given character's inborn attributes. Each Characteristic has a score that describes the degree of the character's aptitude. A score of 0 is completely average, and therefore positive numbers denote higher-than-average ability and negative numbers below-average ability. All but the most exceptional of individuals have Characteristics that fall between –3 and +3.

Since Characteristics represent your character's inborn potential, they cannot be increased by normal means. In rare circumstances, the storyguide may decide that drastic events warrant some sort of permanent change to a Characteristic, and powerful magic can also raise them, but for most characters, they are fixed.

<span id="characteristic-descriptions"></span>
== Characteristic Descriptions ==

<span id="intelligence-int"></span>
==== Intelligence (Int) ====

Intelligence represents the power to analyze and synthesize concepts, as well as simple memory. It is important for Abilities that require thought power and is paramount for the Hermetic Arts. A character with low Intelligence is not necessarily stupid—common sense, street savvy, wisdom, and the ability to learn are not described by Intelligence.

<span id="perception-per"></span>
==== Perception (Per) ====

Perception quantifies the ability to notice things, as well as powers of intuition. While sometimes conscious, Perception often works intuitively — your character simply notices something. The storyguide may also let you roll Perception when checking various Knowledges, to see if you have insight into a certain fact or concept. Perception is important for Abilities such as Awareness, Hunt, and Folk Ken.

<span id="strength-str"></span>
==== Strength (Str) ====

Strength measures physical power: lifting, pushing, shoving, heaving, and moving. Strength is important when hefting a melee weapon and when using brute, physical force against something or someone. People with high Strength are often bigger than those with low Strength, assuming they have the same Size.

<span id="stamina-sta"></span>
==== Stamina (Sta) ====

Stamina represents the limits of a character's exertion, as well as how much physical punishment he can sustain. It is staying power, both mental and physical, and one of its most important components is simply the will to live. Spellcasting relies on Stamina. Stamina also measures someone's ability to

carry a load for an extended period, ignore fatigue, and withstand wounds.

<span id="presence-pre"></span>
==== Presence (Pre) ====

Presence describes a character's appearance, demeanor, and charisma. It is important for making a good impression, as well as for leading people. Presence also measures how imposing or intimidating a person is. Even if not physically attractive, a person with high Presence might still have a demeanor that commands respect.

<span id="communication-com"></span>
==== Communication (Com) ====

Communication represents the aptitude for self-expression. It is important when attempting to influence or communicate with someone, verbally or otherwise. A positive Communication score suggests a character who is comfortable with or confident in his relationships with other people.

<span id="dexterity-dex"></span>
==== Dexterity (Dex) ====

Dexterity means being able to move with agility and to manipulate objects accurately and skillfully. It includes hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, and bodily grace. Dexterity also helps determine how well your character swings a sword or throws a knife.

<span id="quickness-qik"></span>
==== Quickness (Qik) ====

Quickness indicates reaction speed and reflexes, and helps determine who acts first when two people are trying to do something with great haste. It also describes how well your character does something in a hurry. Your effective Quickness is usually modified by your Encumbrance. See page 403 for more information on Encumbrance.

<span id="abilities"></span>
== Abilities ==

Abilities are a character's learned skills. They usually do increase during the course of a saga. Characters in '''Ars Magica''' can choose from a wide range of Abilities, listed in the Abilities chapter starting on page 157, which are divided into five types: General Abilities, which can be learned by anyone, and Academic Abilities, Arcane Abilities, Martial Abilities, and Supernatural Abilities. A character can only learn Academic, Arcane, or Martial Abilities if he has an appropriate Virtue or Flaw, or is a magus.

Supernatural Abilities are even more limited, and a character can only learn one if she meets certain special conditions. The most common is the possession of the Virtue granting that Supernatural Ability, but The Gift allows characters to learn such Abilities, and other supplements describe other ways to access them. Unless a character has a feature that specifically says she can learn a Supernatural Ability, she cannot.

Finally, Spell Mastery Abilities are only available to Hermetic magi, and are described on page 158.

<span id="personality-traits"></span>
== Personality Traits ==

Personality Traits are a short description of important features of your character's personality. For major characters, such as magi and companions, they are normally nothing more than an aide memoire, and a reason to think about the character's personality during character creation, although there are a few specific rules that require Personality Trait rolls.

For grogs, they are more significant. As grogs are often shared between players, or at least played rarely (see Troupe-Style Roleplaying on page 528), the numbers attached to Personality Traits can be used as a concrete guide to playing the character. They can be positive or negative, and normally range between +3 and -3, although there are exceptions. A Minor Personality Flaw (see later) would normally be matched by a Personality Trait of +3 or -3, while a Major Personality Flaw, which a grog would not normally have, would justify a Personality Trait of +6 or -6. 'Loyal' is a particularly important Trait, as it reflects the grog's attachment to the covenant, while 'Brave' is just as important for warrior grogs. A third Trait should be something distinctive about that grog. You may decide to roll a grog's Personality Traits when you are unsure how he would react, or you may treat the numbers simply as a guide to roleplaying. If you do roll them, add nothing but the Personality Trait, and roll a stress die. Suggested Ease Factors are found on the table

<span id="changing-personality-traits"></span>
== Changing Personality Traits ==

Personality Traits can only be changed by the player who controls the character, and only between game sessions. However, they can be changed freely, possibly to reflect a series of exceptional rolls, or to reflect life events. For example, a cowardly grog who stands his ground and kills an impressive monster might well become braver.

<span id="reputations"></span>
== Reputations ==

Reputations determine whether people are likely to have heard of the character, and what they have heard about him. They don't determine how people react to characters they have heard of, as that depends on what they think of what they've heard, nor do they necessarily aid in the identification of characters. Indeed, in some cases a high Reputation may make it difficult for a character to convince people that he is who he says he is.

Reputations have a score, a content, and a type. The score is a number, used as described below. The content is what the Reputation is for, a reputation for killing dragons, powerful fire magic, or learned interpretation of the Psalms, for example. The type determines who might have heard of the Reputation. The most basic type is a Local Reputation, which is one that anyone who lives near the character might have heard. The other two main types are Ecclesiastical and Hermetic Reputations, determining a character's reputation in the Church and Order of Hermes, respectively. The type of Reputation defines what counts as distance.

A random person has heard of a character with a Reputation if a roll of a stress die plus the Reputation equals or exceeds the Ease Factor given on the table below. The more he succeeds by, the more he has heard about the character. If the character's Reputation is largely accurate, so is what the person has heard. Conversely, a largely undeserved Reputation brings lots of false beliefs with it.

Reputations can change over time. See the Long-Term Events chapter, page 386, for details.

== Confidence ==

Important characters have a Confidence Score and Confidence Points. This includes both central player characters (magi and companions) and important NPCs, such as recurring antagonists and allies. These characters start with three Confidence Points. Most such characters start with a Confidence Score of one, but this can be modified by Virtues and Flaws.

There is no limit to the number of Confidence Points that a character can have.

<span id="using-confidence"></span>
== Using Confidence ==

A player may spend Confidence Points on most rolls to get +3 to the total per point spent. He may decide to spend the point after the dice are rolled and the putative result of the action is known. He may not spend Confidence on a roll that botched, but he may spend it on a roll of zero which was not a botch. A player may spend any number of points up to, but not exceeding, the character's Confidence Score.

Once a Confidence Point is spent, it is gone forever. Confidence Points are not recovered.

Confidence may not be spent on rolls which represent a whole season's activities, such as rolls for studying from vis.

<span id="getting-new-confidence-points"></span>
== Getting New Confidence Points ==

The storyguide for a session hands out Confidence Points to characters at the end of the session. To qualify for Confidence Points, the character must have been played for a significant length of time during that session, and must have made a contribution to the session.

Characters should be awarded one Confidence Point for each of the following that they managed:

* Achieve a personal goal.
* Contribute to achievement of a group goal, even if it wasn't a personal goal.
* Success in a difficult task. (Only one award per character per session.)
* Entertainingly well roleplayed. This means that the player portrayed the character well, and in a way that entertained and enhanced the fun of the other players.
* Bonus. This point is awarded if the storyguide thinks that the character or player did something that deserves a reward, but which does not fall under the above categories. You should only award one bonus point per character per session.

Typical characters should gain two or three Confidence Points per session.

<span id="raising-confidence-score"></span>
== Raising Confidence Score ==

A character's Confidence Score can only be increased by long-term story events which greatly increase the character's self-confidence and self-reliance. As a baseline, the fifteen grueling years of a Tytalus apprenticeship are enough to raise a character's Confidence Score by one point. Raises in play should follow on events of a similar magnitude and duration.

<span id="character-templates"></span>
== Character Templates ==

he quickest way to get started playing '''Ars Magica''' is to choose one of the characters presented in this section. All are fully generated, and just need a name

and a bit of background to fit them into your saga. The second quickest way is to customize one of these characters. Finally, you can use the Detailed Character Creation rules, starting on page 43, to build your own character from scratch.

<span id="format"></span>
== '''Format''' ==

Each template is presented in the same format, described below.

Characteristics: A list of the Characteristics and values. If the character has any aging points in any Characteristics, these are shown in parentheses after the Characteristic value. (See Long Term Events, page 391, for aging rules.)

Size: The character's size.

Age: The character's actual age, with the apparent age in parentheses. (See Long Term Events, page 391, for aging rules and apparent age.)

Decrepitude: The character's number of Decrepitude points, with the number of excess Aging Points in parentheses. These are gained from aging, and are described on page 391.

Warping Score: The character's Warping Score, with the number of excess Warping Points in parentheses. Warping Points measure a character's exposure to magic, and have bad effects if you gain too many. See Warping, on page 389, for more details.

Confidence Score: The character's Confidence Score, with the number of Confidence Points in parentheses. Grogs don't have Confidence, so this line is omitted.

Virtues and Flaws: All the character's Virtues and Flaws. These are all described in the Virtues and Flaws chapter, starting on page 61. The first Virtue listed is The Gift, if the character has it. The next is the character's Social Class. Then comes all other Major Virtues, Minor Virtues, Major Flaws, and Minor Flaws, each arranged alphabetically.

Personality Traits: The character's Personality Traits, and scores.

Reputations: Details of the character's Reputations, if any.

Combat: The combat statistics for modes of attack and weapons that the character uses often.

Soak: The character's Soak score.

Fatigue levels: A listing of the character's Fatigue levels and penalties, which represent how tired the character is. Fatigue is described on page 403.

Wound Penalties: Shows the penalties for wounds of varying severity, with the number of points of damage required to inflict a wound of that severity shown in parentheses.

Abilities: All of the character's Abilities, in alphabetical order. The format is Ability X (Z) (specialization), where X is the score in the Ability and Z is the number of experience points acquired towards the next level. If the Ability is written X+Y (Z), X is the score in the Ability, Y is a fixed bonus from a Virtue (usually Puissant Ability), and Z is the number of experience points acquired towards the next level.

Arts: The character's scores in the Hermetic Arts, in the format Art X (Z), where X is the score and Z the number of experience points acquired towards the next level. If the Art is written X+Y (Z), X is the score in the Ability, Y is a fixed bonus from a Virtue (usually Puissant Art), and Z is the number of experience points acquired towards the next level. The Arts are named according to the standard abbreviations, described on page 206. Non-magi have no scores in the Arts, and this section is omitted.

Twilight Scars: Long lasting effects of Wizard's Twilight. Only applicable to Hermetic magi, and described in detail on page 229.

Equipment: The character's stuff.

Encumbrance: The character's Encumbrance, with the character's Burden in parentheses. The rules for Encumbrance are on page 403.

Spells Known: A list of all the Hermetic spells the character knows. Obviously, this is omitted for non-magi. The spells are in the format: Spell Name (TeFo X/+Y) where TeFo is the Technique and Form of the spell, X is the spell level, and Y is the magus's Casting Total with the spell. If the magus has a mastery score in the spell, this is listed as Mastery Z, outside the parentheses, with the Mastery abilities listed (see the Magic chapter, page 225). If the Casting Total is higher than the spell level, the magus can cast it easily. If it's significantly lower, he might have problems. The spells are described in the Spells chapter, from page 301.

Customization Notes: Some notes on the character, and what can easily be changed if you want to customize it.

<span id="grog-templates"></span>
== Grog Templates ==

These templates are intended for use as grogs. You could expand one into a companion fairly easily, though.

<span id="the-berserker"></span>
=== The Berserker ===

Characteristics: Int -2, Per -1, Pre -1, Com -1, Str +3, Sta +2, Dex +2, Qik +1

Size: +1 Age: 15 (15) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0)

Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk, Berserk, Large, Short

Attention Span, Wrathful (Minor)

Personality Traits: Angry +3, Brave +3, Loyal +1

Reputations: None

Combat: Pole Axe: Init +2, Attack +13, Defense +7,

Incapacitated (19–24)

Abilities: Area Lore 1 (streams), Athletics 2 (running), Awareness 3 (attackers), Brawl 3 (kicking), Guile 1 (apologizing), Great Weapons 5 (pole axe), Native Language 5 (insults), Single Weapon 1 (heater shield), Survival 3 (hills)

Equipment: Pole Axe, Full metal scale armor, pack containing gear to care for weapons and armor and establish camps when traveling.

Encumbrance: 0 (3)

Customization Notes: The Berserker's Large Virtue could be swapped out for an Affinity or Puissant Ability with Great Weapons. In addition he could have another Flaw, and take one of those Virtues to balance it. Other than that, he is young, so most of his Abilities are dictated by the concept. The Abilities at 1 or 2 can be swapped around, though.

<span id="the-grizzled-veteran"></span>
=== The Grizzled Veteran ===

Characteristics: Int 0, Per 0, Pre -1, Com -1, Str 0, Sta +1 (1), Dex +2 (2), Qik +2 (2)

Size: 0

Age: 45 (45)

Decrepitude: 1 (2)

Warping Score: 0 (0)

Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk, Warrior, Weakness (talking back to magi)

Personality Traits: Loyal +3, Cheeky +2, Brave +1 Reputations: None

Combat: Axe &amp; Heater Shield: Init -1, Attack +15, Defense +14, Damage +6

Kick: Init –3, Attack +6, Defense +5, Damage +3

Soak: +8 (full metal scale armor)

Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, -1, -3, -5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: -1 (1-5), -3 (6-10), -5 (11-15), Incapacitated (16-20)

Equipment: Axe, Heater Shield, Full Metal Scale Armor, pack containing gear to care for weapons and armor and establish camps when traveling.

Encumbrance: 4 (4)

Customization Notes: The Grizzled Veteran has been around the covenant for years, but has never reached a formal position of leadership, because he has a tendency to talk back to the magi. On the other hand, he makes a good informal leader of the grogs. Age hasn't really slowed him down yet, but it is about to, and the years have already reduced his Presence and Communication to –1 each. He could take another two Flaws and a corresponding

number of Virtues if desired, and his Ability scores can be moved around. The high set should probably be kept in combat, but he could specialize in a different sort of combat (you would have to recalculate Combat Totals), and the secondary abilities can be moved around at will.

<span id="the-hunter"></span>
=== The hunter ===

Characteristics: Int 0, Per +3, Pre -2, Com -2, Str 0, Sta +1, Dex +2, Qik +2

Size: 0

Age: 20 (20)

Decrepitude: 0

Soak: +3 (partial leather armor, Stamina)

Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, -1, -3, -5, Unconscious

Wound Penalties: -1 (1-5), -3 (6-10), -5 (11-15),

Incapacitated (16-20)

Abilities: Area Lore 4 (game trails), Athletics 1 (climbing), Awareness 5 (woodlands), Bows 4 (shooting from cover), Hunt 5 (deer), Native Language 5 (talking about forests), Stealth 2 (hunting), Survival 4 (woodlands)

Equipment: Partial heavy leather, short bow, arrows, survival kit.

Encumbrance: 2 (2)

Customization Notes: The hunter is extremely useful in the wilderness, and can guide the party as well as take part in missile combat. He can also help to support the covenant by bringing in food. He doesn't work well in social situations, though. Note that the character's Bows score uses the bonus XP from Warrior, and thus cannot go below 4, but otherwise the values of his Abilities, apart from his Native Language, can be swapped freely.

<span id="the-specialist"></span>
=== The Specialist ===

Characteristics: Int –1, Per 0, Pre –1, Com –4, Str +2, Sta +2, Dex +3, Qik +2

Size: 0

Age: 19 (19)

Decrepitude: 0

Warping Score: 0 (0)

Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk, Affinity with Single Weapon, Puissant Ability (Single Weapon), Warrior, Afflicted Tongue (stammer), Obsessed (improving Single Weapon ability), Poor Communication

Personality Traits: Brave +3, Loyal +2, Quiet +1 Reputations: None

Combat: Axe &amp; Heater Shield: Init +1, Attack +17, Defense +15, Damage +8

Fist: Init 0, Attack +8, Defense +7, Damage +2

Soak: +9 (full metal scale armor)

Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, -1, -3, -5, Unconscious

Wound Penalties: -1 (1-5), -3 (6-10), -5 (11-15),

Incapacitated (16–20)

Abilities: Area Lore 3 (warriors), Athletics 3 (running), Awareness 4 (in combat), Bargain 2 (weapons), Bows 1 (2) (short bow), Brawl 5 (dodging), Carouse 1 (drinking), Living Language 5 (talking about fighting), Single Weapon 7+2 (Heater Shield)

Equipment: Axe, Heater Shield, Full metal scale armor, pack containing gear to care for weapons and armor and establish camps when traveling.

Encumbrance: 2 (4)

Customization Notes: The Specialist can easily focus on a different Ability, although you might want to swap the Characteristics around as well if he does, and probably change Warrior for one of the other experience-point-granting Virtues, such as Educated or Well-Traveled. You can change Personality Traits freely, and assign the Ability scores to other Abilities. Similarly, the Flaws can be changed without changing the central concept of the character.

Equipment: Axe, Heater Shield, Full metal scale armor, pack containing gear to care for weapons and armor and establish camps when traveling.

Encumbrance: 3 (4)

Customization Notes: The standard soldier's Weakness can be chosen freely, and he makes a good base for creating a slightly non-standard grog, by adding Virtues and Flaws and rearranging his Abilities.

<span id="the-tough-guy"></span>
== The Tough Guy ==

Characteristics: Int -1, Per 0, Pre +1, Com -1, Str +1, Sta +3, Dex 0, Qik +1

Virtues and Flaws: Covenfolk, Large, Tough, Warrior, No Sense of Direction, Overconfident (thinks he can't really be hurt), Weakness (drinking)

Personality Traits: Brave +3, Loyal +2,

Overconfident +3 Reputations: None

Combat: Axe &amp; Heater Shield: Init -1, Attack +10, Defense +10, Damage +7

Incapacitated (19-24)

Abilities: Area Lore 2 (brewers), Athletics 1 (running), Awareness 3 (in combat), Bows 1 (shortbow), Brawl 3 (grappling), Carouse 4 (drinking), Charm 3 (when drunk), Folk Ken 1 (magi), Great Weapon 3 (pole axe), Guile 1 (lying to magi), Living Language 5 (talking about fighting), Music 1 (drinking songs), Single Weapon 5 (heater shield), Survival 1 (on rivers), Thrown Weapon 2 (axe)

Equipment: Axe, Heater Shield, Full metal scale armor, pack containing gear to care for weapons and armor and establish camps when traveling.

Encumbrance: 3 (4)

Customization Notes: The Tough Guy works well as a defender for a magus, because he can take a lot of punishment before dropping and making the magus vulnerable. The Virtues depend on the concept, but the Flaws can be changed freely, and his combat Ability scores can be swapped freely between the combat Abilities he has.

<span id="the-female-scholar"></span>
=== The Female Scholar ===

Characteristics: Int +5, Per +1, Pre +1, Com +2, Str -1, Sta -1, Dex 0, Qik +1

Size: 0 Age: 20 (20) Decrepitude: 0 Warping Score: 0 (0) Confidence Score: 1 (3)

Virtues and Flaws: Clerk, Apt Student, Book Learner, Good Teacher, Great Intelligence (x2), Improved Characteristics; Black Sheep, Driven (Major) (prove herself a greater scholar than any man); Social Handicap (outspoken advocate of the abilities of women)

Personality Traits: Scholarly +3, Independent +1, Trusting -2

Reputations: Selfish shrew 2 (local)

Combat: Dodging: Init +1, Atk n/a, Def +1, Dam n/a

Soak: -1 (Stamina)

Fatigue Levels: OK, 0, -1, -3, -5, Unconscious

Wound Penalties: -1 (1-5), -3 (6-10), -5 (11–15), Incapacitated (16–20)

Abilities: Arabic 1 (medical terms), Area Lore 2 (nunneries), Artes Liberales 3 (rhetoric), Charm 2 (scholars), Church Lore 2 (scholars), Civil and Canon Law 1 (rights of women), Folk Ken 2 (scholars), Guile 2 (lying to authority figures), Latin 5 (academic debate), Living Language 5 (debate), Medicine 1 (women's illnesses), Philosophiae 3 (moral philosophy), Teaching 3 (Artes Liberales), Theology 2 (status of women)

Equipment: Clothes, a slate or wax tablet for writing on.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Customization Notes: The female scholar has estranged herself from her family by refusing to marry a suitable man, and instead pursuing her bizarre interest in academia. She has probably come to the covenant because it is the only place where she can study freely, and she wants access to the covenant library if she doesn't already have it. Her current Virtues are very focused on scholarship, so changing one or two for Virtues that emphasize a different aspect of her life would be fine. Similarly, the emphasis of her studies could be moved to a different subject, as long as she still has a score of at least one in Artes Liberales, so that she is literate.

<span id="the-knight"></span>

Personality Traits: Brave +3, Overconfident +3, Proud +6

Reputations: None.

Combat: Long sword and heater shield (mounted): Init +2, Atk +17, Def +17, Dam +7

Long sword and heater shield (on foot): Init +2, Atk +14, Def +14, Dam +7

Equipment: Full chain mail, long sword, heater shield, great sword

Encumbrance: 2 (3)

Customization Notes: The Knight's Wealthy Virtue gives him a lot of experience points, and so cannot be changed without effectively recreating the character from scratch. Oath of Fealty can be swapped for True Love and still be appropriate. In fact, both are so appropriate to a knight that the troupe may allow you to take both, as the character can still take three more points of Flaws. Note that the character regards himself as superior to just about anyone, unless you change the Major Personality Flaw, and doesn't have the Abilities to interact well with equals.

<span id="the-priest"></span>
=== The Priest ===

Characteristics: Int +1, Per +2, Pre +1, Com +2, Str 0, Sta 0, Dex -1, Qik 0

(angels), Theology 2 (angelology) Equipment: Priest's clothes, a missal.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Customization Notes: The Priest could take another two Minor Flaws and corresponding Virtues, if desired. He may be unaware of his immunity, or being struck by lightning and remaining completely unharmed may have been a central event in his past. If it happened, it should be. The nature of his Lesser Immunity can easily be changed, and even boosted to a Greater Immunity if you take two more Minor Flaws.

<span id="the-rogue"></span>

Equipment: Clothes, secret stash of money that he never spends.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Customization Notes: The Rogue's Dark Secret can be almost anything, but is most likely to be a particularly vile crime that he committed in the past, and now, probably, feels guilty about. The compulsion should be to commit some sort of minor criminal act, such as thievery, or to take risks to prove he can. This character is fundamentally fast and stealthy, although he can turn on the charm to a certain extent. By moving the numbers in Characteristics and Abilities, you can turn him into a charmer with some ability in stealth. Don't forget to change the Great Characteristic and Puissant Ability Virtues if you do this.

Equipment: Old but sturdy clothes.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Customization Notes: The Witch's magical powers are far, far weaker than a Hermetic magus's, but she doesn't have The Gift. She's an excellent healer, and people might not believe that her healing abilities are purely mundane. Intolerant clergy make good enemies, as do magical or faerie beings she has annoyed, although in that case you might want to change the Flaw to Plagued by Supernatural Entity or Supernatural Nuisance. She can take another Major Flaw, or three more Minor ones, along with corresponding Virtues.

These templates are of a stereotypical member of each House, 25 years old and just out of apprenticeship. The asterisk in the Virtues list indicates the Virtue that the magus gets free from his House. See page 46.

The Wound that Weeps (PeCo 15/+12)

Lifting the Dangling Puppet (ReCo 15/+10)

Customization Notes: The Bjornaer is much more comfortable with animals than with people, and may think of him or herself as just as much animal as

human. The combination of Blatant Gift and Inoffensive to Animals means that she gets along better with animals than with people. Ways of the Forest should be changed to a terrain appropriate to the actual heartbeast; a wolf is assumed for the example. Both Major Flaws can be changed freely, and while Deficient Form (Ignem) is very common in House Bjornaer, there is no particular reason for your character to have it. Note that Quiet and Subtle Magic allow the magus to cast in his heartbeast form without any penalty.

Clouds of Summer Snow (CrAu 25/+24)

The Incantation of Lightning (CrAu 35/+24)

Purification of the Festering Wounds (CrCo 20/+16)

Customization Notes: The Bonisagus is most likely Driven to make some great discovery in magic. He or she is a so-called 'lab rat', a magus happier in his laboratory than in the outside world. However, the

favors he owes and his drive to discover are likely to push him out. Similarly, enchanted items are very useful to him, but he is bad at making them for himself. That also tends to drive him into stories. This concept is built around the Virtues and the Driven Flaw; the other Flaws can be changed easily. He can also take two additional Minor Flaws, or make Driven Major, and take two additional Minor Virtues to balance them. Similarly, the Arts in which the character has an Affinity can be changed, but that also requires changing the spells he knows.

Customization Notes: The Criamon does not have her maximum allowance of Flaws, so could take an additional Major Flaw or three Minor Flaws, with corresponding Virtues, if desired. Her Charm and Folk Ken scores could be moved into other Abilities available in the first five years of life (see the Detailed Character Creation rules, page 43), possibly also moving her good Presence score as well.

Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie (InMe 20/ +21)

Peering Into the Mortal Mind (InMe 30/+21)

Customization Notes: If the Guernicus lies (says something she believes to be untrue as if it were true), she cannot use any magic until the sun next rises or sets. Anyone who wants to tell a lie in her presence soon after she casts a spell (within two minutes or so) must make a relevant Personality Trait check against an Ease Factor equal to the magnitude of the spell cast. If the check fails, he cannot bring himself to lie, although he can remain silent. The Guernicus could take four more points of Flaws, and corresponding Virtues.

At the moment, he is a social and political creature, but the score in one of those Abilities could be moved into a Martial Ability to make him more of a fighter. Elemental Magic makes it difficult to move Art scores around. Initially, he was assigned scores of Aq 3, Au 6, Ig 6, and Te 6.

Aquam received an additional 33 experience points (from Auram, Ignem and Terram), for a final total of 39 and a score of 8 (3), and each of the other Arts received an additional 25 experience points, for a final total of 46 and a score of 9 (1).

Customization Notes: The Verditius can take another three Minor Flaws, or one Major, and balancing Virtues. In addition, her Craft Abilities can be changed for different crafts without changing the concept much. Finally, not everyone descended from dwarfs is as small as they are, so that Flaw could be swapped for others without affecting the character on a fundamental level.

away from the diabolism practiced by his parens. A companion might be a woodsman with supernatural powers, a Muslim scholar exploring western Europe, or a werewolf seeking a cure for his curse. A grog can be any type of warrior, or a member of the covenant staff, such as a washerwoman, butler, or stablehand.

<span id="starting-character-age"></span>
== Starting Character Age ==

The detailed character creation rules allow you to create characters of any age. This is obviously very useful for storyguides, but it raises the question of the appropriate age for new player characters.

The first thing to bear in mind is that a character over the age of 35 must make aging rolls (see page 392) before the game begins. It is possible for such a character to die of old age before play, although if that happens you can always go back to the previous year.

The second issue is that older characters are more powerful than younger ones. This is particularly marked for magi, who gain experience points and spell levels more quickly once they are out of apprenticeship and no longer need to spend time serving their masters.

The final issue is that older characters take longer to create, because there are more experience points to allocate.

The troupe or storyguide should make a decision on starting ages, bearing these factors in mind. There are a few guidelines worth following, however.

First, new players should create magi who are just out of apprenticeship. Magi have a lot of choices, and until you have played the game a bit you won't know which choices suit your playing style.

Second, in most troupes all magi should be approximately the same number of years out of apprenticeship. Actual ages are relatively unimportant, as magical abilities tend to overshadow mundane. If you decide not to do this, it should be because the whole troupe wants to play in that sort of saga, not because one player has a cool concept for an older magus.

Third, it's a good idea to create companions at a fairly young age (under 30), so that they have several years of play in them. The importance of this varies depending on the speed of your saga (see page 527), but an old companion runs the risk of dying of old age before he's been played a dozen times.

Finally, grogs can be created at any age, and probably should be. Grizzled veterans and eager novices make equally fine concepts, and even characters partially crippled by old age can contribute to stories set at the covenant.

<span id="child-characters"></span>
== Child Characters ==

Creating children using these rules requires the application of a bit of common sense. Abilities can be generated and treated as normal, but a seven-year-old child is not going to be stronger than most adults, even if she has Strength +3. Similarly, some Virtues and Flaws will only become applicable as the child ages, rather than starting out usable.

To generate a child, use the normal rules, and then modify all Characteristics as follows:

Once you have a concept, decide whether the character is a magus, companion, or grog. It is obvious if the character is a magus; he has The Gift and has been trained in Hermetic magic. Before creating a magus character, you should have an understanding of the magic rules. Without at least a basic grasp of the way that magic works, you may make choices that will weaken your initiate magus and curtail his potential for future development. It's probably best to use one of the templates for your first magus.

If the character is not a magus, but is intended to be a central character in the saga, he is a companion. If he is intended to be a bit part, he is a grog. A stablehand intended to be a central character is a companion, and a woodsman with one or two minor magical powers might well be a grog. The rules for character creation differ slightly between the three character types, but they are basically the same. However, there are enough separate steps for magi to make it worth treating them separately.

<span id="magi-only-hermetic-house"></span>
== Magi Only: Hermetic House ==

The next step in creating a Hermetic magus is choosing his House. The twelve Houses are described starting on page 13, and summarized in the nearby table. Membership in a House grants a particular benefit at character creation, which is listed in the table. A magus can only be a member of one House.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Niall is creating an experienced magus for use in a new saga. He decides on the name 'Darius', and his concept is a scary-looking magus who specializes in Perdo magic and in hunting down the enemies of the Order. Looking at the Houses, Flambeau and Tytalus both look appropriate, but Puissant Art (Perdo) fits the concept better than Self-Confident, so he goes with House Flambeau. Darius is now Darius of Flambeau.

<span id="virtues-and-flaws-1"></span>
== Virtues and Flaws ==

s many Virtues and Flaws deal with the character's place in the story, the rules for them differ the most between the character types.

All characters must take a Social Status. There are a number of default Social Statuses that cost no points, see page 65. In particular, all Hermetic magi take the Social Status Hermetic Magus, which costs no points. No other characters may take this Status, because they are not, after all, Hermetic magi.

Grogs are somewhat limited in their choice of Virtues and Flaws, to ensure that they remain minor characters. They may have up to three points of Flaws, and a corresponding number of Virtues. Grogs should have only Minor Virtues and Flaws. In addition, grogs may not have The Gift (having The Gift makes you an important character), and may not have Story Flaws, as those Flaws make characters central to stories, and that is not the role of the grogs.

Companions may, in principle, choose any Virtues and Flaws. They may have up to ten points of Flaws, and a corresponding number of points of Virtues. Major Virtues and Flaws are worth three points each, Minor Virtues and Flaws are worth one point each.

Companions who do not have The Gift may not choose Hermetic Virtues or Flaws. Companions may have The Gift, and thus take Hermetic Virtues or Flaws. However, this should be extremely unusual; the main reason for creating such a companion is that you want to play through the apprenticeship of a magus. The Gift is, however, free, even if taken by a companion. Bear in mind that, unless the character can get access to magical training, it is almost entirely a Flaw, because of its effects on social interactions.

Mythic Companions get more Virtues for their Flaws, as described in the rules on page 63.

Like companions, magi may take up to ten points of Flaws, and the same number of points of Virtues. Major Virtues and Flaws cost three points each, Minor ones one point. All magi must have The Gift. Without it, they cannot work magic, and thus cannot be magi. In addition, all magi should have at least one Hermetic Flaw. Nobody fits perfectly into Hermetic theory.

The rules for taking Virtues and Flaws are summarized in the Virtues and Flaws chapter, on page 61.

<span id="choosing-virtues-and-plaws"></span>
== Choosing Virtues and Plaws ==

There are a lot of Virtues and Flaws available in this game, and it may be difficult to decide what to choose. The first thing to remember is that you do not need to choose the maximum number of Flaws.

Every player should consider Personality Flaws, and Story Flaws for companions and magi, as these make the game more engaging and enjoyable for you by telling the rest of the troupe what sort of stories you want to experience with the character. They do not hinder your character, but rather get them involved in enjoyable plots.

Most Virtues and Flaws are not necessary for any concept, even if the name suggests that they might be. For example, a pagan character does not need to have the Pagan Flaw — the Flaw indicates that their religion creates stories or shapes their personality, and that might not be your plan for the character. This means that, in general, you can pick Virtues and Flaws that look appropriate, and do not need to worry that you have missed something vital by not checking all the others.

There are two exceptions. One is that a character must have a Virtue to buy Academic, Arcane, Martial, or Supernatural Abilities at character creation. Educated, Arcane Lore, and Warrior, respectively, are the easiest options for the first three groups, although other Virtues (and some Flaws) also grant access to some of these Abilities. In most cases, access to each Supernatural Ability is granted by a separate Virtue.

The second concerns social status. If you want your character to be a knight, with all the social standing that implies, you must take the Knight Social Status. On the other hand, you do not need

<span id="quick-and-casy-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== Quick and Casy Virtues and Flaws ==

If you want to get started really quickly, use the following highly simplified guidelines.

* Grogs: Take a Minor Personality Flaw that reflects how you want to play the character. Social Status is Covenfolk. Take Warrior for a grog who fights, Educated for a grog who is educated, Arcane Lore for a grog who knows about the supernatural, and Puissant Ability in the character's specialty for any other type of character.
* All Companions: Take a Major Personality or Story Flaw that reflects the types of stories you want your character to be involved in. Social Status is Covenfolk.
* Martial Companions: Take Warrior, and Puissant and Affinity with the same Martial Ability.
* Learned Companions: Take Educated, and either Puissant with two Academic Abilities, or Puissant and Affinity with the same Academic Ability.
* Social Companions: Take any one of Gossip, Piercing Gaze, Social Contacts, Well-Traveled, or Venus Blessing. Take Puissant with two Social Abilities.
* Magical Companion: Take one Minor Supernatural Virtue that grants a Supernatural Ability, and Puissant and Affinity with that Ability.
* Magus: Take a Major Personality or Story Flaw that reflects the types of stories you want your character to be involved in, and Deficient Form in a Form that you are not interested in. Social Status is Hermetic Magus. Choose a Minor Magical Focus that does not rely on your Deficient Form. Choose one Technique that overlaps with your Minor Magical Focus, and take Puissant and Affinity in it. Choose one Form that overlaps with your Minor Magical Focus, and take Puissant in it.

that Virtue to be an armored and mounted warrior (although you would need Warrior or another Virtue that gives you access to Martial Abilities). In most cases, social status does not define the way that other members of the covenant see you, so if your character is not concerned about wider society, you do not need to worry about this.

Finally, a lot of the Virtues and Flaws are very specialized, to support particular types of character found in Mythic Europe. You can safely ignore these, until you decide that you want to play that sort of character.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-1"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Niall starts by looking for appropriate Flaws to fit his concept. Driven seems like a good Personality Flaw; Darius cannot help hunting down enemies of the Order at all times. Similarly, those activities are likely to produce Enemies, and Niall picks a Renounced magus and his cronies to be the enemies in question. Blatant Gift fits well with the scary image Niall wants, and he didn't imagine the character being able to interact much with mundanes anyway. That's three Major Flaws, so nine points already. Blatant Gift is a Hermetic Flaw, so that requirement is met. Finally, Niall takes Disfigured (facial burns) as a Minor Flaw, reinforcing the image and giving him ten points of Flaws.

Then it's time to buy good stuff. As a magus, Darius already has The Gift and Hermetic Magus, and Puissant Art (Perdo) came free as a Flambeau. Niall takes Affinity with Perdo to back up Darius's specialty. He decides that Darius has done his job well, so he takes Hermetic Prestige to reflect his reputation in the Order. Hunting magi is a very dangerous game, so he also takes Premonitions and Second Sight, making it hard to take Darius by surprise. Similarly, shooting first is an advantage, so he takes Fast Caster. That's five Minor Virtues, leaving Darius with five points to spend. Niall has a look at Major Virtues, and decides that Flawless Magic will be extremely useful. It will let him cast spells more quickly, and with higher Penetration, which is a very good thing when facing other magi. That uses another three points, but he still has two Minor Virtues to buy. He chooses Strong-Willed and Enduring Constitution, which fit the image and provide a bit more breadth.

<span id="characteristics-1"></span>
== Characteristics ==

haracteristics are bought on the following table. You start with seven points to spend. All characters buy Characteristics in the same way.

For Hermetic magi, you should note that Intelligence is central to Hermetic laboratory work, and thus magi should seriously consider taking a positive score in it. Similarly, Stamina is very important for spellcasting, and so a negative score there is best avoided. Communication is vital if you want your character to write good books.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-2"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Niall starts by giving Darius an Intelligence of +3, spending six of his points right away. Following on with the idea that Darius is hard to surprise and good at hunting, he spends the seventh point on a Perception of +1. However, he doesn't want everything else to be zero. Fortunately, the concept practically demands a negative score in Presence, so Niall drops that to -3, and Communication to -1, giving him seven more points to play with.

Stamina is the other score most useful for magi, so Niall makes a deliberate decision to leave it at zero. The character will be more interesting if he has strengths in other areas, he thinks. Instead, he buys Quickness +2 (good for dodging), Strength +2 (he can hit hard), and Dexterity +1 (making him better than average in combat). It looks like Darius will occasionally use physical combat, which makes sense; steel can get through Magic Resistance without any trouble.

<span id="abilities-1"></span>
== Abilities ==

bilities represent a character's learned abilities. For grogs and companions they are acquired in two blocks: early childhood, and later life. For magi, there are two

more periods to consider: apprenticeship, and life as a magus after that.

Your character's age determines the maximum score she can have in any Ability at character creation, although some Virtues raise this limit. These limits do not apply to characters in play, and there is no cap on Abilities during play. In practice, most Abilities will not rise above 10, but there may be exceptions.

<span id="garly-childhood"></span>
== Garly Childhood ==

In the first five years of life, characters gain 75 experience points in their native language (see page 167 for the Language Ability), which normally gives them a score of 5, and 45 experience points to divide between Area Lore (for the place or places the character is growing up), Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Folk Ken, Guile, Living Language (other than the character's native language), Stealth, Survival, and Swim. You do not need to put points into all of these Abilities; choose the ones that best fit your conception of the character. This represents what the character picks up as she plays as a child.

<span id="sample-childhoods"></span>
== Sample Childhoods ==

The following Ability packages can be taken to speed up character generation. Each represents a particular sort of childhood. Note that you

can spend the 45 experience points for yourself, as well.

* Athletic Childhood: Athletics 2, Brawl 2, Native Language 5, Swim 2
* Exploring Childhood: Area Lore 2, Athletics 1, Awareness 1, Native Language 5, Stealth 1, Survival 2
* Mischievous Childhood: Brawl 2, Guile 2, Native Language 5, Stealth 2
* Social Childhood: Charm 2, Folk Ken 2, Guile 2, Native Language 5
* Traveling Childhood: Area A Lore 1, Area B Lore 1, Folk Ken 2, Living Language 1, Native Language 5, Survival 2

<span id="later-life"></span>
== Later Life ==

After early childhood, the character gains 15 experience points per year, which may be placed in any Abilities, as long as the character has a Virtue that permits her to learn those Abilities. Academic, Arcane, and Martial Abilities require a Virtue, as do Supernatural Abilities.

Characters with the Wealthy Virtue get 20 experience points per year, while characters with the Poor Flaw get 10 experience points per year. Note that only companions can take this Virtue or Flaw.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-3"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Darius has a number of free Abilities from his Virtues, so Niall notes them first: Premonitions 1, Second Sight 1, Mastery of All Spells 1.

The next issue is his early childhood. Niall chooses German as Darius's native language, and, at this point, Uwe as his original name, so that gives him German 5. He then spends 15 exp on Bavaria Lore 2, 15 exp on Awareness 2, and 15 exp on Folk Ken 2, bringing Uwe/Darius to the age of 5.

Now he needs to decide when the boy became an apprentice, and he picks 10 as a nice, round number. He has 75 experience points to spend from those five years, and he spends 15 exp on Brawl 2, 15 exp on Guile 2, 5 exp on Athletics 1, 5 exp on Concentration 1, 5 exp on Etiquette 1, 5 exp on Intrigue 1, 5 exp on Leadership 1, 5 exp on Stealth 1, 5 exp on Survival 1, and 5 exp on Swim 1. That leaves him with 5 experience points, which he decides to spend on Order of Hermes Lore 1. It's a general Ability, so he can, and he rationalizes the decision by assuming that his future master took him to the covenant some time before his apprenticeship actually began.

<span id="magus-only--apprenticeship"></span>
== Magus Only — Apprenticeship ==

The fifteen years of apprenticeship give the character 240 experience points, and 120 levels of spells. These experience points can be spent on Arts or Abilities, including Arcane, Academic, and Martial Abilities. Note that magi can only spend experience points on Arcane, Academic and Martial Abilities before apprenticeship if they have

Magi must have the following minimum Abilities: Parma Magica 1, Magic Theory 1, Latin 1. Characters with lower scores would not be admitted to the Order. A character without a Latin score of least 4 and an Artes Liberales score of at least 1 is unable to read the books of the Order. This will seriously weaken the character relative to other

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-4"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Spending the apprenticeship XP is fairly easy. Niall spends 50 exp for Latin 4, 50 exp on Magic Theory 4, 30 exp on Artes Liberales 3, 5 exp on Finesse 1, 15 exp on Penetration 2, 5 exp on Profession — Scribe 1, 5 exp on Chirurgy 1, 5 exp on Faerie Lore 1, 5 exp on Infernal Lore 1, 5 exp on Philosophiae 1, and 5 exp on Magic Lore 1

Then he looks at Hermetic Arts. He has 60 experience points left. He spends 37 points on Perdo, which his affinity turns into 56 points, so that he has Perdo 10 (1), and a bonus of +3 from Puissant. Then he puts almost all of the rest into Creo and Corpus: 15 exp on Creo 5, 3 exp on Corpus 2.

Darius adds 11 to his Technique + Form to determine the highest level spell he can learn (his Magic Theory specialty in &quot;inventing spells&quot; applies). He chooses to take all Perdo spells, selecting The Wound that Weeps (PeCo 15), Dust to Dust (PeCo 15), Parching Wind (PeAq 20), Soothe the Raging Flames (Pelg 20), Veil of Invisibility (Pelm 20), Calm the Motion of the Heart (PeMe 15), and Loss of But a Moment's Memory (PeMe 15).

Because of his Flawless Magic Virtue, Darius has a Mastery Score of one in each spell, and thus Niall has to choose a special ability for each.

Finally, just before Gauntlet, he spends his last 5 exp on Parma Magica 1.

magi, and you should be aware of this before designing such a character. A character with a Latin score of less than 5 cannot write books, which may also be important. A Magic Theory score of below 3 is weak, and, in particular, means that the magus cannot set up his own laboratory. Very few magi have a score in Parma Magica over 1 immediately after apprenticeship, as this Ability is normally the last thing taught. Indeed, the magus is not taught the final secret to raising a Parma until after he has sworn the Oath. Magi should also seriously consider putting points into Code of Hermes, Concentration, Finesse, Order of Hermes Lore, Penetration, and Profession (Scribe).

<span id="permetic-magi-recommended-minimum-abilities"></span>
== Permetic Magi Recommended Minimum Abilities ==

Latin 4

Parma Magica 1 (should be no higher if the magus is just out of apprenticeship)

Total Cost: 90 experience points

Do not forget that casting totals add a Technique and Form together, and that you will get a higher total by splitting experience between a Technique and a Form than by putting all the experience points in one or the other.

The highest level spell you can learn is equal to Technique + Form + Intelligence + Magic Theory +3, where the Technique and Form are the Technique and Form of the spell in question. If the spell has requisites (see page 311), they apply to this total as well. This is the appropriate Lab Total, assuming an aura modifier of +3, and thus any Virtues and Flaws your character has apply to this total if they would apply to a Lab Total in play.

<span id="magus-only--after-apprenticeship"></span>
== Magus Only — After Apprenticeship ==

If you want to generate a magus who is some time out of apprenticeship, the rules change again. You might want to wait until you are familiar with the game system before doing this, however. There are a lot of options and considerations, which could easily seem overwhelming.

For every year, the magus gets 30 points. Each point can be an experience point in an Art or Ability or one level of spell. The maximum spell level a magus may know is limited as before. Thus, a magus who is 20 years out of apprenticeship could have a highest Art of 15, while a magus 120 years out of apprenticeship might have a highest Art of 40.

Of course, you may not want your experienced magus to have spent all his time studying Abilities, Arts and spells. If you wish to have your magus engage in other lab activities (such as creating items, enchanting familiars, and in particular creating

Longevity Rituals) you will need to know more about the circumstances in which he has been working. These are ultimately up to the storyguide, but a typical situation might be as follows:

* The magus' covenant (for Aging rolls) gives a Living Conditions modifier of +1 (see Aging, page 391).
* The magus' lab is of only average quality, giving a modifier to Lab Totals of 0.
* The covenant has a Magic aura of 3.
* The magus may use a maximum number of pawns per year equal to Magic Theory x 5, of the Arts required. It is not possible to accumulate pawns from year to year, because this number already represents vis the magus has saved while studying from books and inventing spells.

Statistics for familiars and apprentices should be agreed with the storyguide, if required.

For each season that your magus spends working on a lab project, the character loses 10 points from the yearly 30 experience points, to a minimum of 0 if three or four seasons are spent on lab work. Thus it is most cost effective to have the magus engage in a full year of lab work at a time. It is suggested that you advance your magus year by year, spending several on study, then taking years out to do lab work as the character's statistics reach appropriate levels.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-5"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Darius will be out of apprenticeship when the saga starts, so Niall takes him further. For the eight years from 26 to 33, inclusive, he just lumps all the experience points together. This gives him 240 experience points to spend in various ways. First, he spends 25 exp raising Parma Magica to 3, as a magus-hunter needs decent Magic Resistance. Then he spends 5 exp on Great Weapon 1, and gives Darius a spear. Next, he spends 88 exp to raise Corpus to 13. He reasons that Darius wants to devise his own Longevity Ritual, and have a decent Penetration with PeCo spells. Next, he goes for a bit more versatility, spending 30 exp to raise Creo to 10, 60 exp to raise all of Aquam, Ignem, Imaginem, Mentem, Terram, Vim to 4, and 1 exp each on Rego and Intellego, for scores of 1 in each. That leaves him 30 exp, which he spends on Winter's Icy Touch and a level 20 version of Rusted Decay of Ten-Score Years (PeTe 10, Target increased to Group = +2 Magnitudes). Again, he needs to pick a mastery ability for the spell.

Niall then decides that Darius will spend the next year in the laboratory, so he gains no experience points in that year. See the Laboratory Chapter from page 249 for details of these activities. Season 1: Opens spear haft (staff) for enchantment (8 pawns vis); Season 2: Attunes spear haft as a talisman; Season 3: Creates Longevity Ritual (7 pawns vis, Lab Total 35, for a +7 bonus against aging); Season 4: Instill the talisman with the effect 'The Wound that Weeps' (PeCo 15), with 0 penetration and 50 uses per day. Open the talisman to the attunement &quot;+4 Destroy things at a distance&quot;, because a spear is still basically the shape of a staff.

From this point, Niall advances Darius a year at a time, because aging results might have an impact on his study and development. In Darius's 35th year he spends 15 exp on Hunt 2, 5 exp on Civil and Canon Law 1, and 10 exp on raising Animal to 4. At this point, Niall decides that Darius would have risked suffering a Twilight, as he is the sort of magus who is likely to botch from time to time. Darius has a Warping Score of 2, with five Warping Points left over, because he is ten years out of apprenticeship. He makes the roll to control the magic, and succeeds, so that Darius does not actually go into Twilight at this point.

Niall then continues aging Darius to the age of 87, but that's enough example.

Older magi can learn spells more quickly than these guidelines suggest. You may therefore want to use these rules to have a magus learn spells as a lab project if you are advancing him more than forty years or so beyond apprenticeship.

Remember that you should also make aging rolls for the character each year from the age of 35. Thus you will probably want your magus to have acquired a Longevity Ritual (see page 261) by then. Some skilled magi offer their services creating Longevity Rituals for others, and you may decide that your character has bargained for one such ritual, especially if you are not interested in studying the Arts of Creo or Corpus. The precise details of such bargains and the bonus given by the resulting ritual should be agreed with the storyguide.

Magi of Hermes contains 15 magi detailed with full statistics immediately after apprenticeship and every 15 years thereafter, including details of any spells they invented or magic items they created. These can serve as a source of ideas, or be used as-is in the saga, even as player characters.

<span id="personality"></span>
== Personality ==

Choose a few words to describe your character's personality, and attach a value between -3 and +3 to each. These are your character's Personality Traits (see page 28). If you have a Minor Personality Flaw, you should represent that by a Personality Trait with a score of +3 or -3, and a Major Personality Flaw should have a Personality Trait of +6 or -6.

Grogs should have a score (positive or negative) in Loyal, and warriors should have a score in Brave. Most warriors will have a positive score in Brave, but not all.

For companions and magi, they are normally nothing more than a guide to roleplaying, although you can roll them if you really want to, so you shouldn't worry too much about them. A few specific rules do require rolls on Personality Traits, however.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-6"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Niall picks Brave, Dedicated to Cause, and Efficient as Darius's Personality Traits, and gives him scores of +3 in each. Darius is quite an extreme individual, but the numbers are unlikely to have much impact on play.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-7"></span>
=== Example: Darius of Flambeau ===

Darius does have a Reputation, thanks to his Hermetic Prestige Virtue. It's a reputation with Hermetic magi, and it has a level of 3. Niall picks 'Dedicated Hoplite' as the content. (The Hoplites are the enforcers of the Order of Hermes. It's an informal grouping, but its members are respected.)

<span id="reputations-1"></span>
== Reputations ==

Characters only start with a Reputation if they choose a Virtue or Flaw that grants one, but all characters can develop them in play. See page 28 for rules on Reputations.

<span id="confidence-1"></span>
== Confidence ==

Grogs do not have Confidence Points. Like Story Flaws, Confidence Points indicate a central character.

Companions and Magi start with a Confidence Score of 1 and 3 Confidence Points, unless they have a Virtue or Flaw that indicates otherwise.

Confidence Points can be spent to gain a one-off +3 bonus to any die roll, and a maximum number of Confidence Points equal to the character's Confidence Score may be spent on a single roll. More details on Confidence can be found on page 29.

<span id="equipment"></span>
== '''Equipment''' ==

Your character may start with any equipment or possessions she might reasonably have acquired and retained over her career. You need not list all her possessions.

<span id="example-darius-of-flambeau-8"></span>
== Example: Darius of Flambeau ==

Darius starts with the normal Confidence Score of 1 and 3 Confidence Points. His only noteworthy piece of equipment is his talisman-spear; Niall can assume that Darius has any mundane material he needs.

With the statistics completed, Niall finishes filling in the details of Darius's appearance and background, preparing him for play in the saga.

<span id="option-extremely-complex-character-generation"></span>
== Option: Extremely Complex Character Generation ==

It is possible to generate a character by working out exactly what he has done in every season he has been alive, and using the rules in the Laboratory and Long-Term Events chapters to determine the results. This is how magi and important companions are normally advanced in play, but it takes a very long time for character generation. It tends to produce characters who are close to those generated using the detailed rules, but with a lot more character.

Even if you do generate a character this way, you should still use the normal guidelines for the first five years of life, and you assign Virtues, Flaws, and Characteristics in the normal way. However, age-based limits on Abilities do not apply, and all Virtues and Flaws have their normal effect on character advancement. You must discuss with your troupe the resources that the character has available, with sensible choices, it is usually hard to raise Abilities above the age-based limits, which is why they exist in Detailed Character Creation.

<span id="mythic-companions-1"></span>
== Mythic Companions ==

Mythic Companions are generated in the same way as other Companion characters, with some important exceptions:

* All Mythic Companions take a Free Virtue which specifies their status. These Virtues are incompatible with each other, and with The Cift, and are not available to grogs.
* You gain a free Minor Virtue, normally specified by the Mythic Companion Virtue. In addition, you may take up to ten points of Flaws, and each point of Flaws is worth two points of Virtues. This produces a maximum of 21 points of Virtues and 10 points of Flaws. Most Mythic Companion Virtues require you to take some particular Virtues and Flaws; these count against your maximum of 20 points of Virtues and 10 points of Flaws.

<span id="characters-with-might-scores"></span>
== Characters with Might Scores ==

Characters with a Might Score are not human, strictly speaking. No being with a Might Score can have Virtues which affiliate them to another realm, for they are full members of the supernatural realm which gives them their Might. This includes The Gift, True Faith, Faerie Blood, and Blood of the Nephilim; but also Supernatural Virtues which draw on sources from a different realm than that of their Might. They may not even take corrupted versions of these Virtues, such as The False Gift.

If a character receives Magic Resistance from more than one source, these totals do not stack, even if they derive from the same Realm (Infernal Might and an infernal power, for example); you simply use the higher total.

Characters with a Might Score are immune to all Warping (see Warping and Non-Humans, page 389). They may, however, spend a point of their Might Pool to use any Ability or power which normally incurs Warping.

Those with a Might Score are immune to supernatural backlashes of their realm — Twilight, Hubris, Vituperation, and so forth — but still suffer any other consequences of a failed or botched roll when using their powers.

You should also agree with the troupe on a minimum set of Ability scores that the character should have by the time character generation is complete. As for Hermetic magi, this set of Abilities should come to a total of 90 experience points. Note that this is not an additional 90 points to spend; it is rather a restriction on how about 90 of your experience points may be spent. (The set will often include Supernatural Abilities in which the character gets an initial score of 1 from the Virtue granting it, and you will not need to spend experience points for the first point of those Abilities.) While most Mythic Companion types make suggestions for these Abilities, you may create a character with a different spread of Abilities if you can convince the troupe that it is a good idea.

The following types of Mythic Companions cover all the supernatural realms. You should consult the troupe before choosing one of these, as a Nephilim and Devil Child might not work well together in the same saga.

<span id="devil-child"></span>
== Devil Child ==

Devil Children are the creations of particularly powerful demons, who create them for a specific task. They are tragic figures; potent with Hellish powers but doomed to live a short life being manipulated by their demonic parent. However, their souls do not belong to Hell despite their ancestry, and they have the free will to choose for good or evil. Created as weapons in the conflict between Heaven and Hell for the souls of mankind, Devil Children can be a powerful tool of evil, and a firm hand is kept on them by their demonic creator. However, they also have the potential to be a great tool of good if they seek redemption, and should they come to the attention of Heaven's forces, they may well be targeted for either salvation or destruction. This often results in the Plagued by an Angel or Supernatural Nuisance Story Flaws.

''Note'': Devil Children are very powerful and are recommended for high-powered sagas or sagas with elder magi.

Required Virtues:

All Devil Children must take the following Virtues:

* Devil Child (Free Mythic Companion virtue)
* Demonic Blood (Major, Supernatural)
* Demonic Might or Demonic Powers (Minor, Supernatural — free with Devil Child)
* Puissant Guile (Minor, General)

Required Flaws:

All Devil Children must take the following Flaw, or a suitable substitute agreed with the troupe:

• Tragic Life (Major, Supernatural)

Devil Children may take three more points of Virtues at no cost (to balance the compulsory Major Flaw with six Virtue points), and may take an additional seven points of Flaws, each point granting two Virtue points.

Devil Children do not have any common required Abilities, because their involvement in their demonic heritage varies from one individual to another. Their Abilities should reflect the task for which they were created.

<span id="faerie-doctors"></span>
== Faerie Doctors ==

If humans are to dwell in regions haunted by the fae — such as the rural areas which provide the food of nations — then they must learn to come to an amicable relationship with their good neighbors. In lands historically connected to Saxon cultures (principally England, Frisia, and Saxony) a faerie doctor may act as an intermediary between the

humans and the fae, leaving the region blessed indeed. Also called a lybman (who practices lybcraeft, magical healing and surgery), the faerie doctor is a human who speaks to the faeries on behalf of the peasants, explaining their concerns and wishes. Likewise, the local faeries know that the faerie doctor supports their flow of vitality by reinforcing the tales and lore of their kind within his region of influence. The faerie doctor takes it upon himself to keep the memory of the local fae alive through stories, and to ensure that their homes are not violated. Should a dispute between humans and faeries arise, the faerie doctor attempts to mediate. ensuring that there are no misunderstandings on either side; but he must attempt to remain a neutral party. In addition to his job as mediator and storyteller, the faerie doctor also administers directly to his human charges through use of faeriegranted supernatural powers, such as the removal of blights, banes, and diseases through his Curse-Throwing power. Faerie doctors are also adept at locating water and lost things through dowsing.

The faerie doctor is trained from birth by a relative, often an uncle, for the calling tends to run in families. Faerie doctors are almost exclusively male, although women can be taught the art if no other relative can be found. The apprentice is taught the lore of the faeries, and has direct and personal contact with all the Good Folk in the local region. As the boy enters puberty, he acquires a companion from amongst the fae, a friend who provides him with unique insights into faerie-kind and warns him if he is about to make a social faux pas. These faeries usually have a high Cognizance, and this proves useful in explaining the actions of other fae. Apart from this, the faerie friend can take any form — it may be a willowy nymph, a talking animal, a wizened dwarf, or any number of other types of faerie. Upon acquiring his companion, the faerie doctor's apprenticeship is complete. He either takes over his mentor's practice, goes into partnership with him, or moves to a new area to strike out on his own.

Faerie doctors often accompany their oath to not take sides in conflicts between humans and faeries with other oaths that reflect their status as having a foot in both realms. The most common oaths are to never cut one's hair, to never grow a beard, to wear women's clothes, and to remain celibate. Such oaths represent the distance the faerie doctor must keep from the rest of humanity to maintain his close connection with the fae. Unsurprisingly, a faerie doctor may clash with the priesthood who see his 'clients' as demons or evil spirits; however, the faerie doctor is rarely pagan himself. He simply realizes the true place of the fae in the daily lives of those under his care.

<span id="paerie-doctors-as-mythic-companions"></span>
== Paerie Doctors as Mythic Companions ==

Players wishing to play a magus-level faerie doctor should take the following Virtues and Flaws

<span id="required-virtues"></span>
==== Required Virtues: ====

All Faerie Doctors must have the following Virtues:

* Faerie Doctor (Free, Mythic Companion)
* Dowsing (Minor, Supernatural Free with Faerie Doctor)
* Wise One (Minor, Social Status)
* Curse-Throwing (Major, Supernatural)

<span id="required-flaws"></span>
==== Required Flaws: ====

All Faerie Doctors must have the following Flaws, or suitable substitutes agreed with the troupe:

* Faerie Friend (Minor, Story)
* Dutybound obey the oaths of a faerie doctor (Minor, Personality)

<span id="minimum-ability-scores"></span>
==== Minimum Ability Scores: ====

Faerie Doctors should begin play with the following minimum Ability scores:

* Curse-Throwing 4
* Dowsing 1
* Faerie Lore 3
* Profession: Storyteller 1

The Student of Faerie Virtue and the Faerie Upbringing Flaw are very common amongst Faerie Doctors, and a high number are Gender Non-Conforming. Many of them possess enhanced abilities to resist many curses and diseases (such as a Greater or Lesser Immunity, or Rapid Convalescence Virtues). Other useful Virtues include Free Expression, Purifying Touch, and Second Sight.

A character can be a faerie doctor without being a Mythic Companion, but they are understandably less powerful. They still take the compulsory Virtues and Flaws listed above, but must balance Virtues and Flaws in the normal manner.

<span id="dephilim"></span>
== Dephilim ==

Nephilim are the divine giants and heroes of ancient myth. While older nephilim rarely venture from their divine regiones, a few younger nephilim occasionally leave their homes to wander the earth and experience new things. Most &quot;young&quot; nephilim are about eighty years old, which is the start of their adulthood.

<span id="sin-gating"></span>
== Sin-Gating ==

In some cultures, the supernatural power of Curse-Throwing is called Sin-Eating. A sin-eater uses this power to take on the sins of the dying or recently dead, often acquired by eating a ritual meal of bread, salt, and ale over the body of the sinner. It is believed that the Sin-Eater not only saves the deceased from Hell, but also prevents their spirit from wandering the world as a ghost. The magnitude of the unforgiven sin should be considered to be a Minor, Serious, or Major Affliction as appropriate. The effect of Sin-Eating on the soul of the practitioner or the fate of the mortal soul remains unknowable, but Sin-Eating does prevent the spirit of the deceased from becoming a ghost due to unrepented sins. A sin-eater can still use his Supernatural Ability in the standard fashion, and most commonly takes the curse onto himself. Sin-eaters are often outcast from society, shunned because of the sins they accumulate through their career. The Church regularly excommunicates sin-eaters, not only because of the burden of sin which they carry but also because they encroach on the territory of the clergy to administer to the dead. A particularly evil sin-eater might transfer the sins of the dying onto an

otherwise innocent child in return for pecuniary gain.

Sin-Eating stems from a similar tradition to Curse-Throwing, and thus is most common in cultures descended from Saxon people — in England, Flanders, Frisia and Saxony. Analogous traditions exist in other cultures, such as the Bavarians and the people of the Balkan Peninsula. An intriguing variant of sin-eating is part of the Jewish atonement rituals. Jewish practitioners of a version of Curse-Throwing aligned to the Divine Realm still conduct the rite of the scapegoat. A goat is loaded with the sins of a community on Yom Kippur, and driven into a place of desolation. Incorrectly identified as a propitiatory sacrifice to Satan, the scapegoat (and this is the origin of that phrase) is an act of obedience to God as detailed in Chapter 16 of Leviticus.

Story Seed: A Bjornaer magus comes to the characters for help. He was unwittingly part of the scapegoat rite when observing Jewish practices in his goat heartbeast, and now seeks a way to unburden himself from the community's sins.

Note: Nephilim are very powerful and are recommended for high-powered sagas, or sagas with elder magi. If your troupe is worried about game balance, ensure that age levels for characters are roughly parallel.

== Spirit Votary ==

A spirit votary is a devoted worshiper of a magical spirit. In pre-Christian days, these individuals would be high priests and priestesses, and form a cult to venerate their spirits; similar powers could be found among a number of different cultures. Today, a spirit votary tends to be a solitary figure railing against the overt superiority of the Dominion of God.

<span id="iv-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== IV. Virtues and Flaws ==

lmost all characters have some particular talents and some particular problems, represented in the game by Virtues and Flaws.

Virtues and Flaws are either Minor or Major. Virtues cost points, while Flaws grant points. Major Virtues cost three points, while Major Flaws grant three points. Minor Virtues and Flaws cost and grant (respectively) one point. Players start with no points for buying Virtues and Flaws, and thus must take Flaws if they want Virtues. A

central character may have up to ten points of Flaws, but no more than five Minor Flaws.

Virtues provide a benefit to the character, pure and simple. Players rarely try to avoid getting the benefits they have paid for, so the main problem is making sure that they do not try to get benefits in areas they shouldn't.

Flaws come in two broad types. General, Hermetic, and Supernatural Flaws hinder the character, while Personality, Social Status, and Story Flaws enhance stories. The first category do not have to enhance stories, and the second do not have to hinder the character. If a General, Hermetic, or Supernatural Flaw will not hinder a character, it is not a Flaw, and the character should not be allowed to take it. Similarly, if a Story, Social Status, or Personality Flaw will not enhance stories, a character should not be allowed to take it. Thus, if you do not want to involve demons in your saga, no character can take Plagued by Demon as a Flaw. Conversely, a player who takes a Story Flaw is saying that he wants his character to be involved in that sort of story, so he should make sure that that is true.

Note that Flaws are not 'things you would not want to have were you the character'. They may be things you would very much like to have, but because they are a hindrance or a story hook, they still count as Flaws. This means that some characters may be extremely keen to keep their Flaws. Even more so, a game Flaw need not be a moral flaw, and a game Virtue need not be a moral virtue. Indeed, most moral virtues work well as Personality or Story Flaws, because they get the character involved in stories.

Some Flaws, such as Blind or Mute, could be fixed using Hermetic magic. A character with easy access to such magic can only take such a Flaw if there is some reason why it cannot be fixed, such as that it is part of a character's Essential Nature (see page 210). In general, characters cannot take Flaws which will quickly be removed in play.

<span id="choosing-plaws"></span>
== Choosing Plaws ==

Your choice of Flaws, particularly Story and Personality Flaws, is a way of indicating the stories that you want to tell about your character. Particular concepts may suggest particular Flaws, or vice versa, but there is almost always flexibility.

For example, suppose that you came across the story of Saint Marina the Monk, and were inspired by it. A very brief summary of the story is as follows.

A monk at a certain monastery was accused by the daughter of an innkeeper of getting her pregnant. He refused to defend himself by accusing her of lying, and confessed that he had sinned, and so the abbot assigned strict penances, which he performed without complaining for several years, until he died. After his death, the brothers laying him out discovered that the monk was a woman. Everyone marveled at her humility and obedience. Miracles were performed at her tomb, and she was venerated as a saint. (This is a genuine medieval story, and a web search will provide more detail.)

<span id="social-status-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== Social Status Virtues and Flaws ==

Social Status Virtues and Flaws represent a character's standing in society. In Mythic Europe, no one is completely outside society, and so every character must have one of these, to represent the way that society sees them. In general, these Virtues and Flaws are only available for sagas that take place in the relevant society — this chapter contains the Virtues and Flaws for characters from Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as for Jews, who could live in any of those areas. If your character is from somewhere a long way from the covenant, you should probably take Outsider or a Social Status related to the Order of Hermes, although it might be interesting to note what their status would be &quot;back home&quot;. (Foreign Upbringing might well also be appropriate, although that is not a Social Status.)

<span id="which-flaws-would-you-take"></span>
== Which Flaws Would You Take? ==

The obvious choices for Saint Marina the Monk are Dark Secret (Biologically Female) and Gender Nonconforming, both as Major Flaws. The troupe might say that they overlap too much and require you to reduce Gender Nonconforming to Minor. However, these are not the only choices.

You might take Monastic Vows as your Major Story Flaw, Pious as the Major Personality Flaw, and Gender Nonconforming as a Minor Personality Flaw (because the character is, and might as well get a point for it). In this case, the stories focus on the character's commitment to the monastic vocation, rather than the gender nonconformity.

You might also take Curse of Venus as the Major Story Flaw, Pious as the Major Personality Flaw, and, again, Gender Nonconforming as a Minor Personality Flaw. In this case, the character became a monk to get away from Another option is to take Enemies as the Major Story Flaw, and Optimistic as the Major Personality Flaw. She became a monk to get away from a match chosen by her father, whom she does not like at all. The abbot, and select other monks, are perfectly aware that she is a woman, and approve of her decision to run away. They aren't quite as sure as she is that everything will work out. In this case, you might not take

all the importunate men. The Flaw

serving woman gets a crush on the

monk, and claims to have been

is still there, though, so the problems have not gone away. A

made pregnant.

case are likely to tend towards farce.

There are many other options, and the same is true in general.

These Flaws should serve as inspiration, but you should not feel forced, by a character concept, to take any particular Flaw — not even the Flaw that originally

inspired the concept.

because the character just thinks she

Gender Nonconforming at all

is in disguise. The stories in this

A significant number of Social Statuses are only available to men. This is because the societies of medieval Europe, on which those of Mythic Europe are closely based, were not gender equal. Because these are social statuses, the Virtues and Flaws with a male requirement are available to characters who are perceived by society as male (or as meeting any other requirement given). For example, a female character presenting as male may take these statuses, as long as society believes her to be a man. (You may want to give her Flaws to represent the complexity of her situation — see the nearby insert on Choosing Flaws.)

This only applies to Social Statuses. All other Virtues and Flaws are available to characters of any race, gender, or background, although some may be more common in particular groups. For example, Warrior is a General Virtue, and thus may be taken by female characters, even though most trained fighters in Mythic Europe are men.

<span id="virtues-and-flaws-rules-and-guidelines"></span>
=== Virtues and Flaws Rules and Guidelines ===

A Virtue or Flaw may be taken more than once only if the description explicitly allows it. Most Virtues and Flaws may only be taken once.

All characters must take one Social Status, and may only take more than one if the descriptions of the Virtues or Flaws explicitly note that they are compatible.

A character should not have more than one Story Flaw. This is a guideline, and may be violated with the whole troupe's agreement. The risk is that one character will be central to too many stories.

À character may not have more than one Major Personality Flaw. A character should normally not have more than two Personality Flaws in total, as more risks him becoming a caricature.

<span id="types-of-virtue-and-plaw"></span>
= Types of Virtue and Plaw =

There are several specific types of Virtue and Flaw. These are described here, and every Virtue and Flaw lists its type.

<span id="the-gift"></span>
== The Gift ==

The Gift is a special Virtue, because it has no cost. The character suffers all the penalties of The Gift, just as magi do (see page 203), but can be taught Supernatural Abilities without having to take the corresponding Virtues (see page 383 for rules). Most importantly, the character can be taught Hermetic Magic, so all magi must have this Virtue. A character with The Gift, even if he is not a magus,

may take Hermetic Virtues and Flaws which relate to intrinsic ability rather than background or training.

Characters may take Virtues that grant Supernatural Abilities without taking The Gift, and such characters do not suffer the penalties imposed by The Gift. However, such characters may not learn new Supernatural Abilities in the course of the saga, although they may improve the ones they already have. It is possible for unGifted characters to Initiate new Supernatural Abilities through a Mystery Cult, but even this is harder for them than for the Gifted.

Characters who have The Gift may start play with a single Supernatural Ability, without having to take any other Virtue, but if they wish to learn others they must find opportunities to do so in the course of the saga. They may also take Virtues granting Supernatural Abilities if they wish to have more Abilities at character creation. Note that it is harder for a character with Supernatural Abilities to become a Hermetic magus (see Training Your Apprentice on page 270), so you may not wish to take any such abilities if you plan for the character to become an apprentice. The ability to cast Hermetic magic is the single supernatural ability possessed by Hermetic magi in virtue of The Gift; again, they may take more Supernatural Ability Virtues if they wish.

Grogs can never have The Gift, as a character with The Gift is too important to be a grog. As a rule, companions should only have The Gift if they are intended to become magi, or if they are members of one of the other magical traditions described in Ars Magica 5th Edition supplements. Troupes should not allow any other Gifted characters unless they are absolutely sure that they want them.

<span id="hermetic"></span>
== Hermetic ==

Only characters with The Gift can take these Virtues and Flaws, and some are only applicable to Hermetic magi who have already completed their training.

If a character has enough Supernatural Virtues for Flaws that affect all of them to be of comparable scope to those affecting a magus's Hermetic Magic, the troupe may allow the character to take appropriate Hermetic Flaws as Supernatural Flaws. In most cases, Hermetic Virtues are still not applicable, but the troupe may choose to allow some.

<span id="social-status"></span>
== Social Status ==

These Virtues and Flaws indicate your place in society, something that is very important in the hierarchical world of Mythic Europe. Some Social Status Virtues are Free, which means that they do not cost any points to buy.

<span id="social-statuses-by-culture"></span>
== Social Statuses by Culture ==

Because Social Status Virtues and Flaws refer to a character's place in society, the available options vary depending on the society they live in. The &quot;societies&quot; given on page 65, are not precisely defined, and not, in most cases, closely tied to geography. Western Christendom is mostly in western Europe, but includes the Crusader States, while Islamic includes the southern Iberian peninsula, and the Jews live everywhere.

<span id="supernatural"></span>
== Supernatural ==

Supernatural Virtues and Flaws provide the character with some benefit that goes beyond the mundane. All Supernatural Virtues and Flaws are associated with one of the four realms, Magic, Faerie, Infernal, and Divine. The most common association for player characters is with the Magic realm, and this should be the choice if the character concept does not suggest another option. Some Virtues are always associated with other realms, such as Faerie Blood and Strong Faerie Blood, which are always associated with Faerie. A Virtue's description notes if it is limited in this way. The Faerie realm is an appropriate source for most Supernatural Virtues, and in some cases, with the troupe's approval, Divine or Infernal sources may be appropriate. Note that Divine and Infernal Supernatural Virtues create more complex roleplaying situations than those associated with Magic or Faerie, and troupes may wish to avoid them for that reason.

The realm of a Virtue or Flaw determines how it interacts with supernatural auras (see page 410), and provides important background color. In addition, a character with a Supernatural Virtue or Flaw is immune to Warping caused by living in a high aura associated with the same realm (see page 389).

<span id="personality-1"></span>
== Personality ==

A Major Personality Flaw is an aspect of the character's personality that defines them and drives stories. You should suggest projects that your character might have to the troupe, so that the storyguide can use them to create plots if everyone likes the idea. Similarly, the troupe or storyguide can suggest that this might be a good moment for the character's Flaw to get the better of them. (Conversely, the storyguide can certainly say that this would be a really bad moment, and then you should keep the Flaw under control, to avoid spoiling the game for everyone.)

For this reason, a Major Personality Flaw should always be something that makes the character act. Depression and angst are unsuitable as Major Personality Flaws, as they will make the character sit moping at home, and keep the player from having fun. On the other hand, these Flaws need not be things that other characters think badly of. A Pious character who wants to go on a pilgrimage, or a Compassionate character who wants to build an orphanage, are just as driven by their Personality Flaws as a character with Hatred who wants to commit murder, or one with Avaricious who aims to steal the local lord's treasure.

In any case, a Personality Flaw leads to stories driven by your character's actions, so choose one that reflect actions you want your character to take.

A character may not have more than one Major Personality Flaw, as the Personality Flaw should be what people think of immediately when they think of the character.

Minor Personality Flaws are aspects of a character's personality that strongly color much of what he does, but do not really interfere with or guide his life. The character can always ignore a Minor Personality Flaw when following it would be inconvenient, and certainly when it would clearly cause serious problems. Because you should choose a Flaw you want play, however, it should have a substantial effect at other times.

Most characters should not have more than two Personality Flaws, Major or Minor, lest they move from entertaining to profoundly irritating.

A Major Personality Flaw drives your character to act and get involved in stories, while a Minor Flaw merely provides color.

<span id="story"></span>
== Story ==

Story Flaws are background features which can drag the character into stories. Most count as Major Flaws because they give the storyguide a way to drive your character to get involved in a story, no matter how inconvenient it might be. Most of the time, however, they are merely background color. You should not take more than one Story Flaw, Major or Minor, to avoid having a single character unduly dominate the saga.

When creating your own Story Flaws, bear in mind that they should always depend on someone or something outside the character, so that the storyguide can decide when your hook drags you off on an adventure. An internal Story Flaw is really a Personality Flaw (see earlier).

Minor Story Flaws are much the same as Major Story Flaws, except that the character gets some solid benefit from the situation as well as being dragged into stories at inopportune moments.

Note that, when you take a Story Flaw, you are promising the rest of the troupe that you will play in those stories. Your character may not like the events that the Story Flaw leads to, but you should choose one that will lead to stories you want to play.

<span id="personality--story-flaws"></span>
== Personality &amp; Story Flaws ==

In a typical saga with five players, each of whom has a companion and a magus, there may be ten Major Personality and ten Story Flaws. This means that a given Flaw will probably only have a significant effect in one story in twenty. If you are planning to run multi-session stories, or a short saga, you may, therefore, want to limit the number of such Flaws that the players can take, because otherwise they may never come into play.

<span id="general"></span>
==== General ====

General Virtues and Flaws cover everything else. Most provide bonuses or penalties to mundane activities.

<span id="tainted-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== Tainted Virtues and Flaws ==

Tainted Virtues and Flaws are associated with the Infernal realm, and can be granted through corruption by demons (see ''Realms of Power: The Infernal'', chapter 9). They can also be taken at character generation, although no more than half a character's Virtues should be tainted, and similarly for Flaws. (That is, no more than five points of Tainted Virtues, or ten for a Mythic Companion, and no more than five points of Tainted Flaws.) Supernatural abilities granted by Tainted Virtues or Flaws are always Infernal powers.

At the troupe's discretion, non-tainted versions of some of these powers may also be available, and associated with the Magic or Faerie realm.

<span id="virtues"></span>
== Virtues ==

Academic Concentration (Subject) Minor, General

The character has concentrated in one of the seven subjects of Artes Liberales, in preference to the other six. He may add +3 to his Artes Liberales score for that subject. However, he must subtract 1 from Artes Liberales rolls and totals for the subjects he did not concentrate in. Include the bonus and penalty modifier in every total that Artes Liberales is used for, including writing books. This Virtue is incompatible with the Virtue Puissant Artes Liberales. Puissant Artes Liberales means a character is particularly adept with all seven liberal arts, while Academic Concentration means the character focused on one liberal art in preference to the others.

With troupe approval, this Virtue could be extended to Philosophiae. It is not allowed for any other Ability besides Artes Liberales and Philosophiae.

Adept Laboratory Student

Minor, Hermetic

You digest the instruction of others quite easily. You get a +6 bonus to Lab Totals when working from the lab texts of others, including when reinventing spells.

Affinity with Ability

Minor, General All Advancement Totals for one Ability are increased by half, rounded up, as are any experience points you put in that Ability at character creation. You may only take this Virtue once for a given Ability, but may take it again for different Abilities. If you take this Virtue for an Ability, you may exceed the normal agebased cap during character generation (see page 48) by two points for that Ability.

Affinity with Art

Minor, Hermetic Your Advancement Totals for one Hermetic Art are increased by one half, rounded up. At

character creation, any experience points you put into that Art are also increased by one half (rounded up), and you may exceed the normal recommended limits. You may take this Virtue twice, for two different Arts.

'Alim

Minor, Social Status You are a member of the religious elite. You may be a minor official, such as a mu'adhdhin or an imam, or vou may be a major figure, such as a mufti (MUF-tee, someone formally entitled to give a legal opinion) or a gadi (QAW-dee, judge). You may purchase Academic Abilities during character generation. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

All According to Plan

Minor, General

Once per session, a player whose character has this Virtue can reroll a botch die. The character has prepared, in advance, for this exact failure and has a contingency plan, which the player must describe.

Minor, General

This Virtue is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane animals, faeries, or magical beings. These last two include characters associated with Faerie or the Magic realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Faerie or Magic Might.

These beings are strangely drawn to the character, and generally trust or obey her without thinking. She gets +3 on Communication and Presence rolls to affect them. Characters who are Offensive to beings of this sort cannot take this Virtue, including those who have The Gift or Magical Air, though characters who are Inoffensive to them or have the Gentle Gift

Note that while Alluring to Magical Beings can affect Hermetic magi, the Parma Magica protects against this

effect as part of resisting the social penalties of The Gift. Might and other forms of general Magic Resistance do not hinder this effect.

Almogaten

Minor, Social Status The character is the leader of a band of Almogavars, chosen by his fellows for his skill and experience. He commands a dozen men, and he is responsible for their welfare and prosperity. He has Standard Armaments and may take Martial Abilities.

Similar to the Mercenary Captain Virtue, you may choose Wealthy or Poor to represent the fortunes of the Almogaten and his soldiers. If he is Poor, he leads only a half-dozen men and he has hit hard times lately. Some of his men only have Inexpensive Armaments, but his main concern is finding the next meal. If he is Wealthy, he leads a company of two dozen men, and can afford to upgrade their armaments. The band might own several horses, and perhaps some herd animals.

These characters are from the Iberian Peninsula, and if they are particularly far from home the troupe may rule that this is not available as a social status.

Almogavar

Minor, Social Status The character is a member of a band of mercenaries and raiders, living a life of adventure according to a code of honor and discipline. He shares a bond of solidarity with his fellows, and they can depend on each other's loyalty. He has Standard Armaments, and may take Martial Abilities. He may choose to be the Adalil, the second-incommand, at no additional cost, getting an increase in both authority and responsibility. He is supported by his unit, and may

These characters are from the Iberian Peninsula, and if they are particularly far from home the troupe may rule that this is not available as a social status.

not take the Poor Flaw or

Wealthy Virtue.

Amorphous

Major or Minor, Supernatural, Tainted The character is able to take on any human form, so long as it does not identifiably belong to a particular human being. The character develops this ability because his body has adopted the almost-gaseous property of demonic flesh, so any apparent changes in size or fitness are cosmetic, and do not affect the character's statistics. Some amorphous people can select a single shape at midnight, which is the Major form of the Virtue. Its Minor form allows the character to change shape only after having performed a significant act linked to the Obsession of the sponsoring demon. The character may only change to his birth form by selecting it once the conditions of transformation have been met, or involuntarily changing shape when dying or entering holy ground.

<span id="animal-ken"></span>
==== Animal Ken ====

Minor, Supernatural You can communicate with animals as if they were human beings. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Animal Ken 1 (page 159).

<span id="apprentice"></span>
==== Apprentice ====

Free, Social Status This Virtue may be taken by a child character who has the Gift and who has been accepted by an experienced Hermetic magus, with the troupe's approval. You are a discipulus and will receive extensive magical training. having the potential to become a Hermetic magus in your own right. However you must obey the dictates and fulfill the errands of your master and endure his or her rigorous training, and may be treated no better than a slave.

<span id="apt-student"></span>
==== Apt Student ====

Minor, General You are particularly good at learning from others. When being taught or trained by someone else, add five to the Source Quality.

Aptitude for (Sin)

Minor, General, Tainted This catch-all Virtue is for those minor effects which demons grant to their victims to allow them to sin more effectively, and so more often. Each Aptitude for a particular sin adds +3 to all rolls in a very limited circumstance linked to a demon's Obsession. As examples, characters may have aptitudes for picking pockets, for committing adultery skillfully, or for poisoning people.

<span id="arcane-lore"></span>
==== Arcane Lore ====

Minor, General You may take Arcane Abilities during character generation. Unless you have The Gift, you cannot learn Parma Magica. You get an additional 50 experience points, which must be spent on Arcane Abilities.

A Gifted character who is not a Hermetic magus and knows Parma Magica must take the Major Story Flaw Enemy: Entire Order of Hermes, as magi are bound by their Oath to slav the character on sight, unless he immediately joins the Order. Such a character cannot be played in a normal saga, as the other player characters have to kill him.

<span id="archieunuch"></span>
==== Archieunuch ====

Major, Social Status You have risen to enjoy the status and privilege associated with the most important and talented eunuchs, the archieunuchs. Although you are not a ruler in your own right, a ruler likely depends on you to govern effectively and has thus granted you considerable authority to act in his stead. Due to this status and importance, you wield significant influence among the lesser nobility. You might serve either as a regional administrator, an important courtier, or a general, and there are numerous servants and possibly other subordinate eunuchs under your command. You have been granted a residence, either within a castle or palace, or elsewhere. Due to your education, you may take Academic Abilities during

character creation. This social status is found in the eastern Roman empire, with its capital at Constantinople, and does not exist in western Europe or much of the Muslim world. This Virtue is only available to male characters. who must also be eunuchs.

<span id="aristotelian-training"></span>
==== Aristotelian Training ====

Minor, General

The character is trained in the New Aristotle, having received his instruction from a teacher using recently translated texts of Aristotle in preference to the normal curriculum. The character gains a +1 bonus on Artes Liberales rolls for grammar, logic, and rhetoric, as well as a +1 bonus when calculating Disputatio Totals (see Art and Academe, page 103, for details). A magus with this Virtue may add +1 to his Lab Totals if attempting to synthesize the New Aristotle with Magic Theory (as described on page 11 of Art and Academe). This Virtue is compatible with Puissant Artes Liberales.

<span id="atlantean-magic"></span>
==== Atlantean Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

The magus, or an ancestor in his lineage, has studied the magic of exiled Atlanteans and has developed several useful extensions to Hermetic magic.

<span id="possible-abuses-of-storms"></span>
== Possible Abuses of Storms ==

A ReAu spell with Storm duration intended to &quot;keep a storm raging&quot; will not result in a storm that lasts indefinitely. It will keep the storm raging for whatever its original lifetime was. A ReAu spell with a duration of Sun can be used to keep to a storm raging for a day, of course, and repeated castings of such a spell will keep the storm present until the caster gives up.

Similarly, a CrAu spell with Storm duration will not create a storm that lasts

indefinitely. It merely creates a storm that lasts for the duration of whatever storm existed prior to the casting of the spell. That is, if no storm previously existed this spell will have no effect. A CrAu spell with a duration of Storm cast on an existing storm will, however, help to prevent the storm from being dissipated by PeAu effects before it should naturally expire. A CrAu spell with a duration of Sun can be used to create a storm with a duration of a day, of course.

The magus has access to a special Range: Water-way, a special Duration: Storm, and a special Target: Body-of-water, that he may utilize with Spontaneous magic and in Formulaic or Ritual spells.

Water-way (Range): The magus can target anyone, or anything, on (or in) the same water-way as him. For example, a river, canal, lake, or sea is a water-way. Tributary streams of a river are the same water-way as the main river, but are not the same water-way as other tributaries to the main river. In some cases the troupe will need to decide precisely where one water-way begins, and another ends.

The magus must touch the water-way, when casting the spell, and the target must be either also touching the water-way or floating on it (in a boat, for example). A person on the bank of a river cannot be targeted by this spell. The magus need not be able to see the target, but he must be able to sense it in some way, unless the spell is an Intellego effect intended to determine whether something is in the water-way.

For determining the spell level, water-way is the same Range level as Sight.

Storm (Duration): A spell with this duration must be cast during a storm and lasts until the end of the storm. Normally, a storm lasts a number of minutes or hours, but some large storms may last for days. The form of the spell must be either Aguam or Auram, but the spell is not necessarily cast on the storm itself. The length of an entirely natural storm can be quickly estimated by rolling a stress die and dividing the result by 2 — this gives the number of hours that the storm will last. A botch has no consequence, excepting that the storm will dissipate in a number of minutes. The storyguide should secretly determine how long the storm will last — although an InAu spell, or Wilderness Sense Ability Roll could easily reveal this information.

For determining the spell level, Storm is the same Duration level as Concentration.

Body-of-water (Target): A spell with this target targets an entire body-of-water, whether this is a lake, a river, or a sea. Use the same guidelines as water-way to determine where a body-of-water begins and ends.

For determining the spell level, Body-of-water is the same level of Target as

Structure (remember to increase the spell magnitude to affect a very large body-of-water, like a sea or the ocean).

<span id="baccalaureus"></span>
==== Baccalaureus ====

Minor, Social Status The character has completed a three-year program at a university to receive a baccalaureus artium (Bachelor of Arts degree). He is typically between 16 and 19 years old, and has 90 experience points that he may spend on Latin and Artes Liberales — 30 experience points per finished year of studies. His future decisions are varied once he gains his degree: he can extend his university career, teaching extraordinary lectures as he works toward his Magister in Artibus Degree; teach in a cathedral or secular school; become a private tutor for a noble family; or find work in ecclesiastical or secular circles. The character has an Academic Reputation of 1.

This Virtue is compatible with the Hermetic Magus, Mendicant Friar, and Priest Virtues, and can be taken by a female character, but only if she is (or was) studying to be a physician at Salerno.

<span id="rard"></span>
==== Rard ====

Free, Social Status The character has attended a bardic school and has passed the examination after four years, earning him the title of fili at the rank of Dos. This accords him some respect among the native Irish, amounting to a Local Reputation of 1. He should be no younger than 20. You should take the Educated (Bardic) Virtue to represent the learning he has received. This Social Status only applies in Ireland.

<span id="beadle"></span>
==== Beadle ====

Minor, Social Status The character is an assistant to a university dean. He is a townsman or student of merit employed by the university to carry the university's insignia in parades, collect dues and fines, read mandatory announcements

at university congregations, and announce disputationes. The character may purchase Academic Abilities at character generation. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

<span id="bee-king"></span>
==== Bee King ====

Major, Supernatural Bee Kingship is the result of descent from particular faeries, and thus a form of faerie blood. It grants the following advantages:

Bee Kings do not appear to age after reaching maturity, but every Bee King not killed by circumstances dies of a rapid illness precisely a century after birth.

Any Bee King may command any group of bees to perform any action of which they are physically capable, even if it will lead to their deaths. Usual instructions like attacking people, increasing the population of the hive, or constructing objects from wax continue to be performed until the instruction is countermanded (Penetration 50). Simple commands of a sentence or less long can be given orally.

Bee Kings may communicate complex messages to bees by having a single bee land on the Bee King's tongue. This bee then acts as the king's representative to the hive. Bee Kings can understand the speech of hives, and can read the minds of bees that they are touching.

Bee Kings are never stung by any variety of biting insect. An attacking bee swarm is treated as an environmental effect, rather than an opposing mêlee group. The swarm does +10 damage automatically each round. This damage may be Soaked normally.

Note that, in Mythic Europe, bees have kings, not queens, but a female character with this Virtue may choose to call herself a Bee Queen.

This is a Supernatural Virtue, and you cannot lose it when being trained as a magus (see page 269). If your master cannot preserve the ability, you cannot be trained.

<span id="berserk"></span>
==== Berserk ====

Minor, General You are capable of entering a blinding rage when in combat or frustrating situations. You automatically gain the Personality Trait Angry +2 (or more, at your option). Any time you take a wound or wound an enemy, roll a stress die and add your Angry score. A roll of 9+ means you go berserk. The storyguide can also call for a roll when you are strongly frustrated. You may deliberately try to go berserk. In this case, you only need a 6+ when you take a wound or wound an enemy, or a 9+ if you have not been wounded or caused a wound. While berserk, you get +2 to Attack and Soak scores, but suffer a -2 penalty to Defense. While berserk, you cannot retreat, hesitate to attack, or give guarter. If you are still berserk when there are no enemies present, you attack your friends. You may roll once per round to calm down if you desire, requiring a stress die + Perception – Angry against an Ease Factor of 6. You may learn Martial Abilities at character creation.

<span id="blood-of-the-nephilim"></span>
==== Blood Of The Nephilim ====

Major, Supernatural You have the blood of angels in your veins and descend from the great heroes of the Antediluvian Age, the Nephilim. Unless you take the Mythic Companion Virtue, your heritage is somewhat diluted, although still significant.

Your Size is increased to +1, and this increases by +1 for every century you are alive.

You may learn Dominion Lore during character creation without needing to take the Arcane Lore Minor Virtue.

You age incredibly slowly, and may live for hundreds of years. You need make an aging roll only once every ten years after the age of 150, and receive a –5 to Aging Rolls. You gain no benefit from Longevity Potions or any magic or supernatural power that slows or relieves Aging or Decrepitude. Once you gain your first Decrepitude Point,

it becomes increasingly difficult for you to learn new things: subtract your age ÷ 10 from all Advancement Totals, although the Advancement Total for a season cannot drop below 1.

Due to your great size, you must eat vast amounts of food (equal to what three normal people would eat in a day), and have the Minor Personality Flaw Greedy (which counts as one of your normal Flaws). If you go without food for even a single day you fall into a deep slumber, a kind of supernatural hibernation. You will starve to death in (2 + your Divine Might) days unless you are fed your own body weight in food. After awakening, you suffer a number of lost Long Term Fatigue Levels equal to the number of days you went without food. (Note that this Virtue does not itself grant Divine Might; see Strong Angelic Heritage, later.)

You may not take The Gift or True Faith, Hermetic Virtues or Flaws, Methods or Powers (see Realms of Power: The Divine, Revised Edition, pages 46-56), Virtues such as Giant, Mythic, or Faerie Blood, Flaws such as Age Quickly or Lycanthrope, or Virtues or Flaws that affect your Size. A descendant of the Nephilim without Divine Might could, in theory, learn supernatural powers (other than Divine Methods and Powers) from any realm, but that is very rare. Magi and Grogs may not take this Virtue.

<span id="book-learner"></span>
==== '''Book Learner''' ====

Minor, General You have a talent for comprehending the writings of\nothers. When studying from books, treat them as if they were three Quality levels higher than they actually are.

<span id="boosted-magic"></span>
==== '''Boosted Magic''' ====

Minor, Hermetic By spending a pawn of vis when casting Formulaic spells you may &quot;boost&quot; the Range, Duration, Target, or size of the effect by one magnitude. You can do this multiple times for the same spell.

For example, boosting Range from Touch to Sight and Target from Individual to Group would cost you four pawns of vis. You may not reduce any of the parameters of the spell, nor may you exceed the limits of Formulaic magic. Casting success, Fatigue loss, and Penetration are all calculated based on the original level of the spell, but you do add one additional botch die for each pawn of vis used. This has no effect on Spontaneous or Ritual spells, though you can still use vis to boost your Penetration as normal.

Brother Chaplain

Minor, Social Status You are a priest of a crusading order, which is like other priests except that your vow should include obedience and poverty, in addition to chastity. Outside of your order you are answerable only to the pope. You may purchase Academic Abilities during character generation. You wear the distinctive symbol of your order on your surcoat, which is usually colored green. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

Brother Knight

Minor, Social Status You are a knight in a holy crusading order, and it is your duty to be ready to fight the infidel at any time. You have sworn a lifelong vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, and are answerable only to your superiors and the pope. Unless you are Poor, you may have highquality weapons and armor, and two horses. You may take Academic and Martial Abilities during character generation. You wear the symbol of your order on your distinctive surcoat, which is usually pure white (Templars, Hospitallers) or golden (Teutonic knights). This Virtue is only available to male characters.

Brother Sergeant

Minor, Social Status You are a member of a crusading order, but not a knight or a nobleman. You have sworn a lifelong vow of obedience, poverty, and chastity, but this

may not be enforced as strictly for you as it would be for a brother knight. You are answerable only to your superiors in the order and the pope. Unless you are Poor, you may have high-quality weapons and armor, and two horses. You may also take Martial Abilities during character generation. You wear the distinctive symbol of your order on your surcoat, which is usually colored black or gray. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

<span id="bureaucrat"></span>
==== Bureaucrat ====

Minor, Social Status You are a member of the civil administration, probably a katib (KEH-tib, scribe or secretary) or watha iqi (wa- THEH-i-qee, writer of legal documents). You may take Academic Abilities during character creation. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

Capo

Major, Social Status The character manages a trading company that has branches in at least two cities. City and Guild, Chapter 7 gives more details of what this involves. A capo who is also a partner in the business does not select the Partner Virtue, instead selecting Poor or Wealthy, as appropriate to his circumstances.

<span id="cathedral-school-master"></span>
==== Cathedral School Master ====

Major, Social Status The character teaches at a cathedral school, one of the many that dot Mythic Europe. He is at least (30 – Intelligence) vears old and must have scores of 5 in Latin and Artes Liberales, and a Teaching score of at least 3. He may learn any Academic Ability, and may teach it to his students. He is typically not a university man, but was instructed at a cathedral school. He receives 240 additional experience points, which may be spent on Academic Abilities and Teaching. The character has an Academic Reputation of 2.

This Virtue is compatible with the Baccalaureus and Priest

Virtues. Characters with higher university degrees should take those Virtues instead; a magister or doctor gains no additional status from teaching at a cathedral school. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

<span id="cautious-sorcerer"></span>
==== Cautious Sorcerer ====

Minor, Hermetic

You are very careful with magic, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail. You roll three fewer botch dice when casting spells (whether ritual, formulaic, or spontaneous), and when working in the laboratory. This Virtue may not reduce the number of botch dice rolled below one. However, its effects are applied before any other effects which reduce botch dice, such as Spell Mastery (see page 225), and they may reduce the number of botch dice to zero.

<span id="cautious-with-ability"></span>
==== Cautious with (Ability) ====

Minor, General You are very careful with a specific Ability, and are less likely to fail spectacularly if you do fail when using it. You roll two fewer botch dice than normal whenever you are required to roll botch dice for that Ability. This may mean that you roll no botch dice. This Virtue may apply to any Ability, even one you cannot learn at character creation.

<span id="clan-ilfetu"></span>
==== Clan Ilfetu ====

Minor, Hermetic

The character is a member of Clan Ilfetu within House Bjornaer, and has received extra training in the rituals of the House. You receive 50 extra experience points that may be spent on House Bjornaer Lore, Magic Lore (with a specialty in the Great Beasts), and Gothic, the dead language that the House uses for all of its rituals. It is possible that the magus has also been Initiated into the Esoteric Mystery of Divination and Augury (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, page 58); if so, that Virtue must be purchased with the normal allowance of ten points of Virtues and Flaws. Clan Ilfetu teaches the Divination method of haemagmomancy, which is divination by observing the blood splatters of wounded

animals; this gives the following bonuses to Divination: +5 family, +3 Corpus. See ''Houses of Hermes:'' Mystery Cults, page 12, for more details on House Bjornaer and the role of Clan Ilfetu.

<span id="clear-thinker"></span>
==== Clear Thinker ====

Minor, General You think logically and rationally. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to resist lies, confusion, befuddlement, and subterfuge — whether magical or mundane.

<span id="clerk"></span>
==== Clerk ====

Minor, Social Status You are a member of the literate class and are either a professional scribe, accountant, lawyer, student, or functionary. Due to your training, you may take Academic Abilities during character generation. If you are male, you may be in minor orders (acolyte, exorcist, lector, or doorkeeper), in which case you may marry and still benefit from being a member of the clergy and as such subject to canon rather than secular law. Male characters may also be sub-deacons or deacons, the lesser two holy orders, in which case they would normally be expected to be unmarried. However, if they were already married, and promise complete sexual abstinence, they may still be ordained to these orders. A man may not marry after ordination to holy orders. Those in holy orders are also subject to canon, rather than secular, law. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. This Virtue is available to male and female characters, but female characters may not be in minor or holy orders.

<span id="command-animals"></span>
==== '''Command Animals''' ====

Major, Supernatural, Tainted The character has the ability to mentally command mundane\nexamples of a species of animal\nusually associated with the demon who tainted him or her. At any time, the character may command up to 12 human-sized animals, and may instruct them to do suicidal things. Smaller animals can be commanded in

far greater numbers, so some characters can command swarms of insects, or hundreds of rats.

<span id="commanding-aura"></span>
==== Commanding Aura ====

Free, Supernatural

This supernatural power is granted to characters by either the pope, or the Divine directly. It is an inherent benefit of Church office. Most characters with this Virtue also have the Senior Clergy Social Status Virtue.

The character has a power equivalent to the Hermetic spell Aura of Rightful Authority (page 357), but with Voice Range; this power has no cost, and no Penetration. The character also has a Magic Resistance and a Soak bonus that depend upon his rank in the Church. If the character carries a relic, this Magic Resistance is added to that of the relic.

''Pope:'' Magic Resistance 25, Soak bonus +5.

Cardinal, or legatus a latere: Magic Resistance 20, Soak Bonus +4.

Legatus missus: Magic Resistance 15, Soak Bonus +3.

Archbishop: Magic Resistance 10, Soak Bonus +2.

Papal legates are the representatives of the pope. If the legatus missus — a lower grade with limited powers — delays or deviates from his mission, then his Commanding Aura ceases to work until he completes penance. The Commanding Aura is also lost when a legatus missus completes his mission.

Some lay rulers ordained by the pope (mostly kings

and emperors) also have a Commanding Aura. See Realms of Power: The Divine, Revised Edition, page 42.

<span id="common-sense"></span>
==== Common Sense ====

Minor, General

Whenever you are about to do something contrary to what is sensible in the game setting, common sense (the storyguide) alerts you to the error. This is an excellent Virtue for a beginning player, as it legitimizes any help the storyguide may give.

<span id="convoluted-mind"></span>
==== Convoluted Mind ====

Minor, General, Tainted The character has been exposed to the machinations of demons so often that he has developed a sense of how their minds work. The character gains a +3 bonus on all Infernal Lore rolls to determine what a demon will do, and has a feeling, similar to the Common Sense Virtue, that prevents him from doing stupid things when dealing with demons.

<span id="corpse-magic"></span>
==== Corpse Magic ====

Major, Supernatural This Virtue gives the character the Supernatural Ability of Corpse Magic, at a score of 1.

<span id="covenfolk"></span>
==== Covenfolk ====

Free. Social Status

You are a member of the covenant staff, and may have lived there all your life. You are supported by the covenant, and so your standard of living is determined by the covenant's resources rather than your own. You may not take the Wealthy Major Virtue or the Poor Major Flaw.

<span id="craft-guild-training"></span>
==== Craft Guild Training ====

Minor, General This character has received above-average training during his apprenticeship, from a craft master or professional guild. Like Warrior and Educated, this Virtue gives a bonus of 50 experience points. These must be spent on any Craft or Profession Abilities, Bargain, or Organization Lore: Guild.

<span id="crafters-healing"></span>
==== Crafter's Healing ====

Minor, Supernatural Like the smiths of ancient lore, the character can magically heal wounds by touching them with the tools of his trade. This is a rare and mysterious power that Hermetic magi cannot understand or duplicate, and it is common for this Virtue to follow familial bloodlines. Selecting this Virtue gives the character the Crafter's Healing Ability at a score of 1.

<span id="craftsman"></span>
==== Craftsman ====

Free, Social Status You live by making and selling goods. You are probably a free resident of a town, but you may be from a rural area. The Wealthy Major Virtue and Poor Major Flaw affect you normally.

<span id="curse-throwing"></span>
==== Curse-Throwing ====

Major, Supernatural Characters with this Virtue are able to cure diseases and remove curses by transferring them to another person. Choosing this Virtue confers the Supernatural Ability Curse-Throwing 1.

<span id="custos"></span>
==== Custos ====

Minor, Social Status You are an employee of a covenant, but you have high status within the walls. You may be a grog, or a specialist, or a manager. You may take one group of restricted Abilities during character generation,\neither Martial, Academic, or Arcane Abilities. If you choose Martial or Arcane Abilities, you may still learn to speak Latin, although you cannot read or write it. As a covenant\nemployee, your wealth is

determined by the covenant's prosperity, and you may not take the Wealthy Virtue or Poor Flaw. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.

This Virtue may also apply to employees of other institutions, such as a noble household or a monastery.

<span id="cyclic-magic-positive"></span>
==== Cyclic Magic (positive) ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature (solar, lunar, or seasonal, for example) and as such, is more potent at specific times. At those times, you receive a +3 bonus to all Casting Scores. The bonus also applies to Lab Totals if the positive part of the cycle covers the whole season. The cycle of your magic must be regular and approved by the storyguide. Furthermore, the length of time when the bonus applies must be equal to the amount of time when it does not.

<span id="death-prophecy"></span>
==== Death Prophecy ====

Major, General

You have been blessed or cursed as to your fate. Someone (a magician, a faerie, or other supernatural creature) has put a condition on your death, and until the condition is met, you will not die, though you can be seriously injured. You heal normally, but cannot die as a result of wounds or old age. Unfortunately for you, fate or bad planning can bring about the conditions in unexpected ways. If, for instance, your death condition is to fear only boars, you should be wary of men bearing boars on their coats of arms or of inns named after boars, in addition to the purely mundane creature. This symbolism may not be obvious: a man known as a pig in his village might also count as a boar.

The storyguide must keep the prophecy in mind and give fair warning of items related to the prophecy. This is a Major Virtue because the character knows he can get away with insane risks; sneaking his prophecy up on him is an unfair way of negating the value of the Virtue. Players may only take this Virtue with the agreement of the storyguide or troupe.

<span id="deft-form"></span>
==== Deft Form ====

Minor, Hermetic

You are particularly skilled with one Form. You suffer no penalty to the Casting Total casting spells in that Form when using non-standard voicings/gestures (see page 216), including using no voice or gestures because you are in a non-human form. Voice Range spells still have a Range based on how loudly you are speaking.

<span id="demonic-blood"></span>
==== Demonic Blood ====

Major, Supernatural, Tainted The character has a demon as a parent, and was conceived for a specific task by her Infernal mother or father. Because of this, she is an Infernal being and possesses an Infernal Might (Corpus) score of 5. This grants her Magic Resistance. Her body also contains one pawn of Corpus vis, which can only be extracted once she is dead. She is immune to Warping of any kind, need not eat or drink, and cannot produce a child; however, she suffers the natural urges associated with these activities, and may be required to make Personality rolls to overcome her desires.

She has up to 30 levels of Infernal Powers that may be invoked by spending Might Points. Design the effects using Hermetic spell guidelines, or the maleficia guidelines (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, Chapter 10: The Maleficia), taking into account the Powers of the demon parent. The Might cost for each Power is equal to its magnitude divided by two, rounded down (but always at least one point). These may be constant effects designed in the usual fashion (Sun duration, two uses per day, and an Environmental Trigger; see page 257); her Might Pool is always reduced by the cost of such a Power, and she cannot turn these Powers off. The Initiative total of each Power is the character's Quickness.

She may be unaware of her true heritage, in which case she probably has either the Delusion or Manufactured Ignorance Flaw to explain her remarkable capabilities. She has the close attention of Hell, and thus should

offset this Virtue with a Story Flaw to reflect that attention, such as, Tragic Life. The character many learn Infernal Lore during character creation without needing to take the Arcane Lore Minor Virtue.

She is attended at nearly all times by a minor demon, which tends to remain in spiritual form, watching over her; if necessary, it protects her on behalf of her creator/parent. This demon is a ruach, who can use its Misfortune Power to blight her enemies. If she is unaware of her demonic heritage, she either considers herself exceedingly lucky, or believes the attending demon to be a Magical or Divine spirit. However, this attendant demon means that her demonic parent can always find her, and is kept apprised of what she is up to.

A Demonic Blooded character's life span is short — roughly half that of a pure-blooded human. Her effective age (which applies as if it were her real age when creating a Longevity Ritual and when making rolls on the Aging Table) increases two years for every year that passes, and you must make two aging rolls each year once her effective age reaches 35. There is no way to halt or slow this other than Longevity Rituals, if she can convince someone to make one for her. However, she does not show the effects of aging; any Aging Points acquired do not get applied to her Characteristics, although they do still count as experience points towards Decrepitude.

You cannot take the Infernal Blessings Virtue described in ''Realms of Power: The Infernal''; the Demonic Powers Virtue replaces that Virtue for the demon-blooded. You may not take any Virtue that affiliates her with a realm other than the Infernal. Also, you cannot take the Unaging Virtue or the Age Quickly Flaw. She may not have children, and so cannot have Dependents of this sort.

<span id="demonic-might"></span>
==== Demonic Might ====

Minor, Supernatural You may only take this Virtue if your character has the Demonic Blood Virtue. Her Infernal Might increases by 2 points. Upon her death, her body contains a number of pawns of Corpus vis equal to her (Infernal Might / 5), rounding up. You may take this Virtue more than once, though it can account for no more than half of the character's total Virtues.

<span id="demonic-powers"></span>
==== Demonic Powers ====

Minor, Supernatural Only a character with the Demonic Blood Virtue may have Demonic Powers. He gains an\nextra 20 levels of Infernal Powers\nin addition to the levels granted by Demonic Blood. You may also take this Virtue more than once, though it can account for no more than half of the character's total Virtues.

<span id="devil-child-1"></span>
==== Devil Child ====

Free, Mythic Companion This Virtue has no cost, and can only be taken for a Mythic Companion who has been born with demonic parents. The character gets the Demonic Might or Demonic Powers (player's choice) Minor Virtue free.

<span id="diedne-magic"></span>
==== Diedne Magic ====

Major, Hermetic Your magic lineage and traditions are from the druids and the vanquished former house of Diedne, making you especially skilled with Spontaneous magic. When you cast a Spontaneous spell without expending Fatigue, you may choose to divide by 5 or by 2. If you choose to divide by 5, you need not roll a stress die, and cannot botch, just as normal. If you choose to divide by 2, you must roll a stress die, and may botch.

When you expend Fatigue on casting a spontaneous spell, the lowest applicable Art is doubled before the whole total is divided by two. You still roll a stress die, and may botch.

You must keep your lineage hidden from the Order, giving you a Major Story Flaw — Dark Secret is an obvious choice, but you may choose a different one with troupe approval. This is in addition to your normal allowance of Flaws, and does not grant you any points with which to buy Virtues.

<span id="doctor-in-faculty"></span>
==== Doctor in (Faculty) ====

Major, Social Status

The character has graduated from one of the higher faculties of a university, in medicine, civil or canon law, or theology, having already received his magister in artibus license, and may instruct fellow students. The character may teach anywhere, even at a university that he did not attend. This is the highest educational license in Mythic Europe. A doctor of medicine is also titled magister in medicina, having typically been taught in one of the southern universities.

A character starting the game with this Virtue must be at least (27 – Intelligence) years old. He must have a score of 5 in Latin, Artes Liberales, and the Ability that correlates to his faculty degree. The character has spent ten years at a university and receives an additional 300 experience points, which must be spent on Latin and Academic Abilities. He also begins the game with an Academic Reputation of 3.

Like other working characters, he must spend two seasons a year practicing his profession, either teaching or working in a secular or ecclesiastical court. Both the

<span id="animal-characters"></span>
== '''Animal Characters''' ==

An animal can have personality and add greatly to stories, just as a human can. Despite their obvious limitations, it can be a great deal of fun to play one as a grog, probably while running human grogs as well. More details on animal characters are given in ''Grogs'', page 136,

but players should feel free to simply use the statistics for a mundane animal given in Chapter 13. Supernatural animals are more complex, and rules for them are given in the Realms of Power supplements, particularly Realms of Power: Faerie (page 50) and Realms of Power: Magic (Chapter 5).

Wealthy Virtue and the Poor Flaw are allowable, but players must decide what calamity befell such an erudite scholar if he is Poor, for which he receives a Bad Reputation at a level of 2.

This Virtue is compatible with the Hermetic Magus, Mendicant Friar, and Priest Virtues. It is only available to male characters, with the exception of Doctors in Medicine who graduated from Salerno. That university does train female physicians.

<span id="domestic-animal"></span>
==== Domestic Animal ====

Free, Social Status, animals only The character is an animal who is the property of a covenant or character, and is supplied with food and shelter. He is expected to serve his master in return for this provender, as a mount, beast of burden, hunter, or so forth.

<span id="dowsing"></span>
==== Dowsing ====

Minor, Supernatural You have the ability to find things nearby through the use of a dowsing rod (usually a forked stick) and your own intuitive sense. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Dowsing 1 (page 164).

<span id="dust-devil"></span>
==== '''Dust Devil''' ====

Minor, Supernatural This variant of the Skinchanger Virtue allows the character to adopt the shape of a tamzawit, or dust devil, a small whirlwind carrying dust. She becomes a dust devil of Size +1, can assume the form at any time, and can direct her movement. Rather than a cloak or animal skin, the focus object of this Virtue is a glass amulet formed from sand taken from a Magic aura.

<span id="educated"></span>
==== Educated ====

Minor, General You have been educated in a grammar school, and may have attended a university or cathedral school. You may purchase Academic Abilities during character generation. During character generation you get an additional 50 experience points, which must be spent on Latin and Artes Liberales.

<span id="educated-bardic"></span>
==== Educated (Bardic) ====

Minor, General

The character has attended one of the great bardic schools in Hibernia, either to receive an education (in which case he need not have attempted the punishing examination) or to commence training as a bard (in which case you should also take an appropriate bardic Social Status Virtue). For Senior or Master Bards this Virtue represents additional years of study. You receive 50 extra experience points to spend on Art of Memory, Profession: Storyteller, Profession: Poet, any Area Lore, or any Organization Lore.

<span id="educated-islamic"></span>
==== Educated (Islamic) ====

Minor, General You have been educated in a mosque or Qur'an school, and may purchase Academic Abilities during character generation. You get an extra 50\nexperience points at character creation, which must be spent on some or all of Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Theology: Islam, Islamic Law, and Artes Liberales.

<span id="educated-hebrew"></span>
==== Educated (Hebrew) ====

Minor, General Your character has been\neducated in a beit ha-midrash or yeshivah and may purchase Academic Abilities at character generation. Your character gains 50 extra experience points to be spent on some or all of the following: Hebrew, Aramaic, Theology: Judaism, and Judaic Lore. Characters from Iberia or the East may also spend some of these points on Arabic.

<span id="educated-vernacular"></span>
==== Educated (Vernacular) ====

Minor, General This form of secular instruction, given by tutors to the scions of merchant houses, emphasizes practical skills likely to make the student suited to a leadership role in the family business. The character may purchase Academic Abilities during character creation. She also gains 50 additional experience points, which must be spent on Academic Abilities, Bargain, the Organization Lore of the character's company, Profession Merchant, or the language of

trade in the company's region

(usually Latin, Greek, or Arabic).

<span id="elemental-magic"></span>
==== Elemental Magic ====

Major, Hermetic You have been trained in the ability to manipulate raw elemental Forms (Aguam, Auram, Ignem, and Terram), and view them as a connected whole rather than four separate Arts. Whenever you gain experience from a source dedicated to one of these Arts. you gain half the Source Quality (rounded up) in experience points in each of the other three Arts. For example, if you studied Ignem from a book with a Source Quality of 13, you would gain 7 experience points in each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram.

During character creation, assign all your experience points in Arts. Then assign half the experience points assigned to each of the elemental Forms to each of the other elemental Forms. Do not actually add these experience points to the Form in question until you have finished calculating all the bonus

experience points. For example, if you assign 10 experience points to each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram, and 21 experience points to Ignem, then you should assign 15 bonus experience points to Ignem (5 from each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram), and 21 bonus experience points to each of Aquam, Auram, and Terram (11 from Ignem, and 5 each from the other two Forms).

In addition, if a spell with one of these Forms as its primary Form has another element as a requisite, you use the primary Form to calculate totals, even if the requisite is lower.

<span id="embitterment"></span>
==== Embitterment ====

Major, Supernatural You may make someone hostile to a target of your choice. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Embitterment 1.

<span id="emir"></span>
==== Emir ====

Minor, Social Status This is the same as the Knight Virtue, though due to the rather different upbringing of Muslim\nemirs, you are likely to be as skilled with hunting, religious teachings, and culture as you are with martial pursuits.

<span id="enchanting-ability"></span>
==== Enchanting (Ability) ====

Minor, Supernatural When you set your mind to it, you can magically induce emotions and beliefs in others with a particular kind of artistic expression: music, dance, drawing, storytelling, even craftwork. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Enchanting (Ability) 1 (page 164).

<span id="enduring-constitution"></span>
==== '''Enduring Constitution''' ====

Minor, General You can withstand pain and fatigue. Decrease the penalties for reduced Fatigue levels by one point, and reduce your total penalty from wounds by one point (but not below zero). You also get +3 on rolls to resist pain.

<span id="enduring-magic"></span>
==== '''Enduring Magic''' ====

Minor, Hermetic The effects of your spells tend to last longer than usual (though Concentration, Momentary, and

Ring spells remain just that). The storyguide secretly rolls a simple die, multiply the spell's normal duration by the number rolled. This is usually, but not always, a good thing. This Virtue does not affect the duration of Ritual spells.

<span id="the-enigma"></span>
==== The Enigma ====

Minor, Hermetic You have been initiated into the Outer Mystery of The Enigma (see page 235), and thus are a member of House Criamon. You have a score of 1 in Enigmatic Wisdom. Note that all Criamon magi get this Virtue free at character creation.

<span id="enticer-of-multitudes"></span>
==== Enticer of Multitudes ====

Minor, General, Tainted The character has a version of the Inspirational Virtue that can only be used to manipulate people toward evil acts. The character appears demagogic rather than heroic, and cannot control a group once he has whipped it into a frenzy. The\nenticer forces individuals in a group to make Personality Trait rolls for the particular sin they are attempting to evoke, with a bonus of +5 or more.

<span id="entrancement"></span>
==== Entrancement ====

Major, Supernatural You have the power to control another's will by staring into their eyes and giving them a verbal command. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Entrancement 1 (page 164).

<span id="eunuch"></span>
==== Eunuch ====

Minor, Social Status You have been educated and trained to serve the Byzantine nobility as a courtier, steward, chamberlain, scribe, lawyer, or accountant. You are likely employed by a court, a lesser noble, or a covenant. It is also possible for you to pursue a career in the eastern Church, and some monasteries accept eunuchs. Due to your education, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation. This Virtue is only available to male characters, who must be sexually incapable, rather than simply inactive. This may be due to

castration (see the Castratus Flaw on page 122), but need not be.

<span id="exotic-casting"></span>
==== '''Exotic Casting''' ====

Minor, Hermetic The magus uses non-Hermetic methods to cast Hermetic spells. While he still needs to employ obvious ritual actions, these are not the same words and gestures taught as part of Magic Theory within the Order, and other magi who are unfamiliar with the magus's tradition find it very hard to recognize which spell he is casting. Any attempt to determine the Form of his magical effect (page 217) is made against an Ease Factor of 15, without the magnitude of the effect being subtracted from this Ease Factor as normal. If the character has any Supernatural Abilities, then he uses the same methods to cast his Hermetic magic as he does to use his non-Hermetic magic. The magus cannot choose to use the standard Hermetic methods instead of those of his native tradition, but can choose to reduce or forgo words and gestures in the usual fashion

<span id="extractor-of-form-vis"></span>
==== Extractor of (Form) Vis ====

Minor, Hermetic

(page 216).

The magus can extract (Form) vis from a Magic aura, but only if the features of the aura exemplify the Form. For example, an aura on the shores of a lake might exemplify Aquam, an aura at a burial-site exemplifies Corpus, etc. Extracting vis in this way is a Laboratory activity; the magus extracts a number of pawns of Vis equal to a tenth of his Creo Vim (Form) Lab Total (round up). Obviously, he needs to have a Laboratory in the aura too, and, of course, the magus can choose to extract Vim vis instead (see page 250). This Virtue may be taken multiple times (once for each Form).

<span id="eye-of-hephaestus"></span>
==== Eye of Hephaestus ====

Minor, Supernatural The character can innately tell the quality of a manufactured\nitem. If the item is somehow flawed he is instantly aware of

that by merely touching it. He also has a chance to tell if an item is magical. For supernatural items made by a craftsman, make a Perception + Awareness + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If successful, the character knows the power of the item. For Hermetic enchanted items, or those made by other sorcerers. make a Perception + Awareness + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 12. If successful, the character knows the item is enchanted, but has no idea how, or what its powers might be. Botching either roll results in false information. This Virtue does not offer any information about the actions or commands necessary to trigger an item's powers.

Hephaestus was a pagan god of craftsmen, primarily metallurgists. Calling this Virtue the Eye of St. Dunstan is more appropriate for Christian characters.

<span id="fabric-ripper"></span>
==== Fabric Ripper ====

Minor, Supernatural The character has the supernatural ability to tear any manufactured thing made from plant or animal fibers. This allows her to destroy sails, break the strap holding on individual pieces of armor, snap the

tack of a horse, burst a sack, and tatter a pair of pants with her mind. She spends a Fatigue level to activate the ability, and may only target one object per Fatigue level spent. This is a PeAn(He) 25 effect with +0 Penetration, and does not require any words or gestures.

<span id="factor"></span>
==== Factor ====

Minor, Social Status The character manages the interests of a trading house in a single city. This gives the character a strong social position and connections to many other regions; see City and Guild for more details. Many factors are junior partners in their companies, and they choose the Partner Virtue, not this one.

<span id="faerie-blood"></span>
==== Faerie Blood ====

Minor, Supernatural Somewhere in your ancestry there is a faerie, and this relation gives you an intuitive grasp of the motivations and personalities of those supernatural folk. Faeries are more comfortable around you than around other humans, and given time, may even forget the mortal blood in your veins.

You are resistant to aging, and get -1 to all aging rolls.

Characters with Faerie Blood can learn Faerie Lore at character generation.

Type of Faerie Blood (pick one, or create a similar one):

Blood of the Bee King: The descendants of Bee Kings may give simple instructions to bees they touch, and may understand the thoughts dominating hives of bees. They are unable to give bees instructions that will kill them, except to command warrior bees to attack, since warrior bees are so willing to die (Penetration 25).

Dwarf Blood: You are descended from the master craftsmen of the fay, and get a +1 bonus to any total including a Craft Ability.

Goblin Blood: Your ancestors were the sneaky inhabitants of the shadows underground, and you get a +1 bonus on all totals involving stealth.

Satyr Blood: The satyrs are notoriously lecherous. You get a +1 bonus to Communication and

Presence totals when dealing with sexually compatible characters.

Sidhe Blood: You are descended from one of the noble fay who rule the lands of Summer and Sunlight. Because of the striking and unusual qualities of your nature add +1 to your Presence, but not to more than +3. Many mortals may consider you fascinating or alluring.

Spinnen Blood: A character who has Spinnen Blood can convert his or her own body weight of fiber into cloth per day, simply by touching it. Old cloth, or products made of cloth fibers. can be unwoven using the same ability, but this counts toward the maximum weight of cloth a character can alter per day. Some Spinnen, particularly those who have served as companions to magi, create other useful objects, like tents, ropes, or sails in lieu of the same weight of cloth. These characters are from a single family line that originated near Ghent; see The Lion and the Lily, page 97, for details of how most of the family live.

Undine Blood: The undines are the faeries of the water, and you get a +2 bonus to any action taken underwater, which will partially offset any penalty applied.

<span id="faerie-doctor"></span>
==== Faerie Doctor ====

Free, Mythic Companion This Virtue makes you a Faerie Doctor and a Mythic Companion (page 63). You get the Dowsing Virtue for free.

<span id="faerie-magic"></span>
==== Faerie Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic You have been initiated into the Outer Mystery of Faerie Magic (see page 236), and thus are a member of House Merinita. You have the Ability Faerie Magic 1. Note that all Merinita magi gain this Virtue for free at character generation.

<span id="faerie-raised-magic"></span>
==== Faerie-Raised Magic ====

Major, Hermetic

The character's experience with faeries and the Faerie realm has conditioned him to invent spells very quickly; to him, Formulaic spells seem like inherent powers that you can learn through observation and experimentation.

Because of this, he can teach himself spells outside of the laboratory. You may spend experience points from Exposure, Adventure, and Practice on spells you could normally invent that mimic faerie powers or other supernatural effects your character has observed that season.

To invent a spell in this way, the magus's Technique + Form + Intelligence + Magic Theory must at least equal (the spell's level – 10), and you must spend a number of experience points equal to (the spell magnitude + 4). Spells of level 5 or less cost their level in experience points (but always at least 1). For example, a level 2 spell costs 2 experience points, and a Level 15 spell costs 7 experience points. The magus cannot invent Ritual spells in this way.

If the magus already knows a spell that is similar to one he wishes to invent (see Similar Spells, page 260), any experience points you spend towards learning that spell are increased by one-half, rounded up. This means that a level 25 spell would cost 6 experience points instead of 9, for example.

This Virtue also includes the Virtue Spell Improvisation. That is, you may add the magnitude of a known Formulaic spell as a bonus to your character's Casting Total when spontaneously casting a spell that is similar to it.

If you take this Virtue during character creation, you should normally take the Faerie Upbringing Flaw. Because the magus's master also had to teach him about human society, he probably had less time to teach him Hermetic magic. It is possible that the apprentice invented Formulaic spells quickly enough on his own to compensate for this, but you might take the Weak Parens Flaw to suggest this limitation of his apprenticeship.

<span id="failed-apprentice"></span>
==== Failed Apprentice ====

Minor, Social Status

You were once apprenticed to a mage, but something kept you from completing your studies. Perhaps your Gift was incomplete or some grievous mishap robbed you of it altogether. You may still work for your former master or for the covenant in some other

capacity. Magi welcome you and have compassion for you — those who are given to such emotions, anyway. You may learn Academic, Arcane, and Martial Abilities during character creation, and you are familiar with the lives of magi. You may not have The Gift, but if your Gift was not completely destroyed, you may have some Supernatural Abilities. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally.

<span id="falconer"></span>
==== Falconer ====

Minor, Social Status The character trains hawks and falcons for a noble patron, and is responsible for the training, breeding, and health of the animals. He often has a personal servant to assist, and is an important member of the noble household, treated with great respect. He should possess the Ability Profession: Falconer, which governs the care of the birds, treatment of their diseases, and acquisition and breeding of hawks and falcons. The Ability Animal Handling is used for the training of the hawks. A specialist in non-falcons, such as the hawks, is called an austringer.

A falconer receives 50 extra experience points at character generation to spend on the Abilities: Animal Handling, Area Lore, Etiquette, Hunt, Latin, Profession: Falconer, and Ride. Many falconers are also Educated.

<span id="falls-like-a-cat"></span>
==== Falls Like a Cat ====

Minor, General

The character is not injured by falls of up to three times his height, or six times his height if he can soften his fall by catching on windowsills, breaking through awnings, or hitting branches on the way down. At greater heights the character suffers Impact damage of +1 for every additional foot, if landing on a hard surface, or for every additional four feet, if landing on a soft surface.

<span id="familiarity-with-the-fae"></span>
==== Familiarity with the Fae ====

Minor, Supernatural

You have a natural understanding of faerie ways, perhaps due to spending time among them. You get a +2 to all rolls involving

social interaction with faeries. You also gain the effects of the Common Sense Virtue, but only when the situation pertains to faeries. You may purchase Faerie Lore at character generation, even if normally unable to take Arcane Abilities.

<span id="famous"></span>
==== Famous ====

Minor, General You have a good Reputation of level 4. Choose any reputation you like (it need not be justified), and one type.

<span id="fast-caster"></span>
==== Fast Caster ====

Minor, Hermetic Your magic takes less time to perform than that of other magi. You gain +3 to Initiative to cast spells in combat and +3 to rolls to determine fast casting speed.

<span id="feather-messenger-minor-supernatural"></span>
==== Feather Messenger Minor, Supernatural ====

This Virtue is only available to a character who can take the form of a bird (which may be her natural form). She can painlessly separate a feather from her body, and use it to write as a quill, controlling its movements telepathically while it remains within sight. The quill doesn't need ink, it provides it magically. After she finishes writing, the character can reattach the feather if in bird form. The quality of the

control the dropped feathers.

This Virtue is particularly associated with a north African magical tradition called the Daughters of Four Fathers (see Between Sand &amp; Sea, page 107).

character as a scribe does not

a human, and still mentally

differ between human and bird

forms. The character can also pull

off feathers in bird form, turn into

<span id="ferocity"></span>
==== Ferocity ====

Minor, General, animals only Like companion and magus characters, this character has Confidence points. However, these Confidence points may only be used in situations where\nits natural animal ferocity is triggered, such as when defending its den or fighting a natural enemy. Describe a situation which activates the Confidence for its species, and

take 3 Confidence points and a Confidence Score of 1 to use when those circumstances are met.

<span id="fidai"></span>
==== Fida'i ====

Minor, Social Status

The character is an assassin of the Nizari Isma'ilis. A fida'i is a devout member of the sect who is prepared to die on its orders, and as such he should consider taking either the Oath of Fealty or Dutybound Flaw. When not on a mission, a fida'i wears white, with a red girdle, cap, or boots. He has been trained in precise placement of daggers and blades, as well as disguise. Fida'i may take Martial Abilities at character creation. He can expect to become a lasig if he proves his loyalty to the sect.

This Social Status Virtue may be taken by a character who is living far from the home of the Nizaris, as the assassins are sent on missions, and may be sent far away. Such a character should have a Story Flaw representing his mission, and choose the Social Status he is pretending to have. See ''The Cradle and the Crescent'', from page 162, for more detail on the Nizaris.

<span id="finding-hidden-loot"></span>
==== Finding Hidden Loot ====

Minor, General

A character with this Virtue gains a +9 bonus to Awareness rolls when searching a confined space for hidden items, provided they can move the contents of the space about undisturbed.

<span id="flawless-magic"></span>
==== Flawless Magic ====

Major, Hermetic

You automatically master every spell that you learn. All your spells start with a score of 1 in the corresponding Spell Mastery Ability. You may choose a different special ability for every spell you have. Further, all your Advancement Totals for Spell Mastery Abilities are doubled.

<span id="flexible-formulaic-magic"></span>
==== Flexible Formulaic Magic ====

Major, Hermetic

You can vary the effects of Formulaic spells to a slight degree, while still getting the

benefits of casting known magic. You may raise or lower the casting level of the spell by one magnitude to raise or lower one (only) of Range, Duration, Target category, and Target size by one step, as long as this does not violate any of the normal limits on Formulaic magic. You may instead change one (only) of those parameters to another parameter at the same level, without modifying the casting level, as long as this does not violate any of the normal limits on Formulaic magic. Casting success, Fatigue loss, and Penetration are all calculated based on the final modified level of the spell. You cannot manipulate Ritual magic in this way.

<span id="focus-power"></span>
==== Focus Power ====

Major, Supernatural

The character has a supernatural power with a narrow range of effects, like the ability to cast Spontaneous spells that are associated with a single type of magic. This power is like a magical focus, in that all of the possible effects have to be related to a specialty that is smaller than a single Hermetic Form. The examples for Major Magical Focus show the scope of this power.

This Virtue grants a pool of 25 points. The maximum level of effect and Penetration both start at zero. It costs 2 points to raise the maximum level of effect by 1, and 1 point to raise the Penetration by 1. Thus, 25 points can allow a maximum level of 10 with a Penetration of 5. or a maximum level of 5 with a Penetration of 15, or combinations in between. The power has an Initiative score equal to the character's Quickness - the maximum magnitude of the effect. The character may create any effect within the scope of the power, up to the level of the effect.

It costs one Fatigue level to activate this power for an effect of level 25 or lower, two Fatigue levels to activate it if the effect has a level of 26 to 50, and three for 51 to 75.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the points gained may be combined.

This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, or Hedge Magic Revised Edition, you may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character. If you do, remember that the levels of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the cost of a level of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)

<span id="folk-magic"></span>
==== Folk Magic ====

Minor, Supernatural The character is capable of performing very minor acts of magic through his knowledge of scraps of occult lore. Choose one (Realm) Lore that is the key Ability for this magic; he may learn this Ability at Character Creation even if he is normally unable to take Arcane Abilities. The choice of (Realm) Lore also determines which supernatural realm his magic is aligned to for the purposes of aura modifiers. He can only create spells in one narrow area, which must be one of the following four options:

Abjuration: Creates a ward against animals or supernatural creatures. Uses the Rego Animal or Rego Vim guidelines.

Divination: Acquire magical senses that detect health, wealth, and mental state. Uses Intellego Corpus, Intellego Mentem, and Intellego Terram guidelines.

Healing: Grants a Recovery bonus for either wounds or diseases, and aids the birthing of children and livestock. Uses the Creo Corpus or Creo Animal guidelines. Infernal Lore cannot be used to produce this type of effect.

Evil Eye: Causes minor acts of mischief like pain, blight of crops, hair loss, sneezing, and so forth. Uses the Perdo Corpus, Perdo Animal, or Perdo Herbam guidelines. Divine Lore cannot be used to produce this type of effect.

To cast a spell the character must expend a Fatigue level, whether the spell succeeds or fails. He must also spend at least 15 minutes preparing the spell, during which time he needs unbroken concentration and access to his &quot;magical&quot; materials (while necessary, these materials offer no benefit to the casting). The spell is designed exactly like a Hermetic spell. The Casting Total is equal to (Stamina + (Realm) Lore + Aura modifier + stress die) / 2. Penetration is calculated in the normal fashion: Casting Total - Spell Level + Penetration modifiers. You may pick this Virtue more than once, to acquire expertise in a different category of spells. Each time you choose this Virtue, you can align it to the same Realm as before or pick a different one, although a character cannot have access to both the Divine and Infernal Realms.

<span id="font-of-knowledge"></span>
==== Font of Knowledge ====

Minor, Supernatural You have supernatural access to information you have never learned. This Virtue bestows the Ability Font of Knowledge 1.

<span id="forge-companion"></span>
==== Forge-Companion ====

Minor, Social Status

The character is an unGifted craftsman attached to a Verditius magus and working for him in his lab. You receive 50 additional experience points, which you can use to raise the particular Crafts her master practices. As a member of his household, she receives protection and support. but she is not protected by any of the legal codes of the Order of Hermes.

<span id="forgettable-face"></span>
==== Forgettable Face ====

Minor, General

Never will this character be the one noticed or picked out of a crowd. Moments after speaking

with him, very few people can give an adequate description of him. He often gets away with things because people are not sure it was actually him. If other characters must make a roll to identify him, it is at -3. On the downside, this trait is incompatible with great beauty, charisma, or commanding presence. Virtues like Venus' Blessing or Inspirational are prohibited, although Curse of Venus could work.

<span id="free-expression"></span>
==== Free Expression ====

Minor, General

You have the imagination and creativity needed to compose a new ballad or to paint an original picture, and have the potential to be a great artist. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to create a new work of art.

<span id="free-study"></span>
==== Free Study ====

Minor, Hermetic

You are better at figuring things out for yourself than you are at poring over books. Add +3 to the Source Quality when studying from raw vis.

<span id="frightful-presence"></span>
==== Frightful Presence ====

Minor, Supernatural

You are capable of instilling great dread through your appearance. This can work in one of two ways: you are either able to contort your face into a vision of terror (common if Presence is less than zero); or else radiate an aura of awe and splendor that makes others weak at the knees (common if Presence is greater than zero).

Everyone witnessing you displaying your Frightful Presence must make an immediate Brave Personality roll against an Ease Factor of 3. Add your Presence to the Ease Factor, ignoring any negative sign (for example, a Presence of +3 or -3 makes the Ease Factor 6). A failure means that they either attempt to flee your immediate vicinity, or else are cowed before your glory.

If the targets remain within your presence (because they are awed or because they are trapped), they can reattempt the Brave roll every two minutes. Once a person

has been affected by the Frightful Presence and recovered from its effects, he cannot be affected again; although you will acquire an appropriate Reputation (such as Fearsome or Awesome) at a score of 2 among those you have affected, which will color your dealings with them.

This effect has a Penetration Total of 0.

<span id="gender-shift"></span>
==== Gender Shift ====

Minor, Supernatural Each midnight, the character may choose to change genders The character's male and female forms are consistent across transformations, and usually appear to be blood kin of each other. The character's Personality Traits may vary slightly between forms. Pregnant characters may not use this ability.

<span id="gentle-gift"></span>
==== Gentle Gift ====

Major, Hermetic

Unlike other magi, whose Magical nature disturbs normal people and animals, your Gift is subtle and quiet. You do not suffer the usual penalties when interacting with people and animals.

<span id="gentlemanwoman"></span>
==== Gentleman/woman ====

Minor, Social Status You are a minor member (possibly illegitimate) of a noble family. You do not stand to inherit from your relatives, but are still treated as one of their own and may be addressed as &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady.&quot; You probably reside near the covenant with your relatives. Although you do not want for anything, you have no vast wealth of your own. You may occasionally ask your family to buy expensive equipment for you, but you will need a convincing rationale. You are expected to wait on your relations much of the time or you will lose the benefits of family (though you will keep your social standing if you can otherwise maintain your normal lifestyle). The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally.

<span id="greater-benediction-examples"></span>
== Greater Benediction Examples ==

Flight

You are able to fly without the need of wings. Every time you take to the air, you lose a Long-Term Fatigue Level, and can remain airborne for a maximum of an hour, traveling up to fifty miles in this hour. Once you touch the ground, your current flight ends regardless of how much of your hour has elapsed. You require a prop to fly, such as a carpet or staff, but any prop of the appropriate type suffices.

True Sight

You are rarely fooled by glamour or illusions that change the appearance of something (although a false image that does not change any particular thing's appearance, such as from a Creo Imaginem spell, still fools you). Further, you can always detect the true form of a shapechanged creature (although not members of House Bjornaer, since both their human and animal forms are &quot;true&quot; forms). This power has a Penetration of 20.

<span id="universally-liked"></span>
==== Universally Liked ====

Everyone who knows you is your friend. You receive a +3 bonus to all social rolls with people who have known you more than one month. Anyone who tries to act against you by swaying the emotions or opinions of others has +3 added to all Ease Factors. This effect has a Penetration of 0.

'''Ghostly Warder'''

Major, General A ghost watches over you. It might be a grandparent, a childhood friend, or anyone else who cares for you enough to stay around after death. The ghost is invisible and silent to all but you and those with Second Sight (see page 170). It can see and hear what is going on around you and makes an excellent spy, since it can leave your presence once per day for up to half an hour. However, death does not leave people in their normal state of mind, so the ghost probably has some quirks that make it less than dependable — it might even

encourage you to join it on the other side. The ghost has 300 experience points in various Abilities that it can use to advise you, and ghosts may take any Abilities. See page 457 for an example of a ghostly warder. This is a more specific version of Magical Warder (see later), and is an example of that Virtue.

<span id="the-gift-1"></span>
==== The Gift ====

Free, Special You have the ability to work magic. See earlier, page 63, for full details.

<span id="good-teacher"></span>
==== Good Teacher ====

Minor, General You can explain new concepts and skills with great facility. Add three to the Quality of any books that you write, and five to the Source Quality for anyone who studies with you.

<span id="giant-blood"></span>
==== Giant Blood ====

Major, General The blood of the ancient race of giants flows in your veins. Though you are not as large as your ancestors, you are up to eight feet tall and can weigh as much as 500 pounds. Your Size is +2, so you take wounds in 7point increments, rather than the normal 5 (see page 404). You also gain +1 to both Strength and Stamina. This bonus may raise your scores in those Characteristics as high as +6. You cannot take this Virtue and Large (page 89), Small Frame (page 145), or Dwarf (page 126).

<span id="gorgiastic"></span>
==== Gorgiastic ====

Minor, Hermetic These magi, or their ancestors, have rejected the teachings of House Criamon and left the House. These magi may have Enigmatic Wisdom and House Criamon Lore scores after character creation. The character's Enigmatic Wisdom Score cannot exceed 4 without the assistance of Criamon magi, or a magical breakthrough. House Criamon attempts to convince Gorgiastic magi to rejoin. Gorgiastic magi do not usually have Criamon markings, but develop them if they begin

to delve into the causes of things; for more details, see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, House Criamon.

Gossip

Minor, General You have regular social contacts\nin the area that provide you with all kinds of information about local social and political goingson. On a simple roll of 6+, you hear interesting news before almost everyone else. You treat all local Reputations as twice their actual level. With some well-placed words, you may be able to bestow new Reputations (whether deserved or not). You quite likely have a Reputation too — as a gossip.

<span id="great-characteristic"></span>
==== Great (Characteristic) ====

Minor, General You may raise any Characteristic that already has a score of at least +3 by one point, to no more than +5. Make sure you describe what it is about you that causes that increase (such as sheer bulk, a lean build, or\nextreme charisma). You may take this Virtue twice for the same Characteristic, and for more than one Characteristic.

<span id="greater-benediction"></span>
==== Greater Benediction ====

Major, Supernatural You have been blessed by some supernatural power. The effects of the benediction should be comparable to other Major Virtues. (See insert for examples.)

<span id="greater-immunity"></span>
==== Greater Immunity ====

Major, Supernatural You are completely immune to one hazard which is both common and potentially deadly. For example, you might be\nimmune to fire or to iron (and only iron) weapons. You may not take immunity to aging — see the Unaging Minor Virtue (page 114) instead. This\nimmunity applies to mundane and magical versions of the thing. If you are immune to fire, you are also immune to magically created fire.

One important possibility is immunity to deprivation, which means that you suffer no loss of

Fatigue or wounds from going without air, food or drink. However, you cannot regain long-term Fatigue without rest and sustenance, and if you are injured deprivation could cause your wounds to worsen.

You may take this Virtue more than once, with a different immunity each time.

<span id="greater-power"></span>
==== Greater Power ====

Major, Supernatural The character has a supernatural power that he can activate at will. If you take the Virtue once, this is a single power, equivalent to a Formulaic Hermetic spell with a level of 50 or lower. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise,\nit has a Penetration of zero.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the levels added together to create several powers. For example, a character who took the Virtue twice could have a power with a level of 60 and a Penetration of 0, and a second power with a level and Penetration of 20 each. By default, there should be one power per Virtue, as this Virtue is intended for powers that are individually significant. See Lesser Power (page 90) if you want your character to have multiple minor powers. However, the troupe may allow the character to take more powers if they have a strong thematic link.

The power has an Initiative equal to the character's Quickness – (power magnitude/2) (rounded down). It costs one Fatigue level to activate if its level is less than or equal to 50, or two Fatigue levels if its level is 51 to 100. Higher level effects are unlikely to make sense.

This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as Realms of Power: The Divine, Revised Edition Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, or Hedge Magic Revised Edition, you may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character. If you do, remember that the levels

of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the number of levels of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)

Greater Purifying Touch

Major, Supernatural You can, with a touch and the expenditure of a Fatigue level, cure a single serious disease. This disease should be either life-threatening or seriously disabling, and should be one from which people do not normally recover by themselves. You must choose the disease that you can cure when you take this Virtue, and you can only cure that disease. You can only choose a disease, not other types of injury or misfortune. See page 406 for more information on diseases, and Art and Academe, page 45 for more detail.

<span id="guardian-angel"></span>
==== Guardian Angel ====

Major, General

You have learned to hear the words of a divine watcher who gives you practical and spiritual advice. The angel whispers in your ear and tells you what is best for you spiritually, rather than materially. He approves of violence only when there is a holy reason — often difficult to demonstrate. If you act against the angel's advice, he may leave you until you correct your ways. The angel has only a limited awareness of your thoughts, but when you speak aloud, he can hear and converse with you.

Your guardian angel can also help in two practical ways. First, he can grant you a +5 bonus to Soak. Second, he can grant you a Magic Resistance of 15. This Magic Resistance is not compatible with a magus's Parma Magica, or Magic Resistance from most other sources, but it does add to the Magic Resistance resulting from Faith Points (see page 419). The angel only grants

you these bonuses if you are acting in accordance with God's will.

<span id="guest-of-house-criamon"></span>
==== Guest of House Criamon ====

Minor, Hermetic

Magi with this Virtue are, politically, members of House Criamon, but may be created using the rules for any other House. Guests are offered membership, which Criamon see as a political formality, for many reasons. The troupe and player should determine why the character found it necessary to find sanctuary with this House.

<span id="guild-apprentice"></span>
==== Guild Apprentice ====

Minor, Social Status The character is a youth between the ages of 10 and 20 who is learning his trade from a guild master or journeyman. He has entered into a contract with his master that guarantees his training. The character is not able to benefit from either the Poor Flaw or the Wealthy Virtue, since he is essentially the property of his master, until he moves to the journeyman rank. Most of his time is spent in ways determined by his master.

<span id="guild-dean"></span>
==== Guild Dean ====

Major, Social Status The character is the ultimate authority of his guild, the man who decides many of the important decisions that face the guild and represents it politically. The character is involved in town politics, long-term trade contacts, and negotiations with other guilds and local craftsmen. The town's population views him as an important and prestigious member of their community. You may select Academic Abilities at character generation.

<span id="guild-master"></span>
==== Guild Master ====

Minor, Social Status

The character is a guild master and may legally practice his trade in town, and hire journeymen to work for him. He participates in guild activities and is considered a member in good standing. You may select Academic Abilities at character generation.

<span id="harnessed-magic"></span>
==== Harnessed Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic You have great control over your spells. You are able to cancel any of your spells simply by concentrating. You can even cancel the magic in magic items which you created. The act of canceling your magic should be treated as if you were casting a spell for timing and concentration purposes. If you are distracted and fail a Concentration roll, another attempt may be made in a later round. Spells and magic items can be canceled out over any distance, but once they have been canceled, you must recast a spell or reinvest a power in a magic item to start the effect again.

The drawback is that when you die, all of your spells and magic items sputter out.

<span id="heartbeast"></span>
==== Heartbeast ====

Minor, Hermetic You have been initiated into the Outer Mystery of the Heartbeast (see page 233), and thus are a member of House Bjornaer. You start with the Ability Heartbeast 1. Note that all Bjornaer magi gain this Virtue for free at character creation.

<span id="hermetic-experience"></span>
==== Hermetic Experience ====

Minor, General

The character has experience with the magi of the Order of Hermes. Maybe he is currently employed by a covenant, once served in the retinue of a magus, or has had other dealings or disputes with them. In any case, you have an additional 50 experience points to spend on Order of Hermes Lore, Magic Lore, or Latin. You cannot spend other experience points on Magic Lore or Latin unless the character has another Virtue or Flaw permitting this. This Virtue may be taken by any grog or covenfolk, or those who have had an exceptionally close relationship with the Order of Hermes. It may be taken by a magus, but there is usually no point.

<span id="hermetic-magus"></span>
==== Hermetic Magus ====

Free, Social Status You are a member of the Order of Hermes. All magi must take this as their Social Status, and only magi may take it.

<span id="hermetic-prestige"></span>
==== Hermetic Prestige ====

Minor, Hermetic Because of something in your background, other magi look up to you even if you haven't\nearned their respect. Some envy you, and most will certainly\nexpect more from you than from\nothers. You gain a Reputation of level 4 within the Order.

<span id="hev"></span>
==== Hev ====

Major, Supernatural The character has

The character has the ability to curse her enemies, making dire predictions about their future, which tend to come true. This gives her the Supernatural Ability Hex at 1. This Virtue is most often associated with the Infernal realm.

<span id="homing-instinct"></span>
==== '''Homing Instinct''' ====

Minor, Supernatural The character always knows\nprecisely how to get from where she is to a number of locations\nequal to her Intelligence Score (a minimum of 1). To add a location to the character's repertoire she must be at that

location, the location must be open to the air (so it cannot be inside, for example), and the player must make an Intelligence + Concentration Roll against an Ease Factor of 6. If this would increase the number of known locations beyond the character's limit, then another location must be &quot;forgotten.&quot;

In addition, the character has a fixed Arcane Connection to locations that she knows, which may be exploited in the usual ways (page 219). This Arcane Connection is an artifact of the mind, and so may not be given to another character.

<span id="imbued-with-the-spirit-of-form-minor-hermetic"></span>
== Imbued with the Spirit of (Form) Minor. Hermetic ==

The magus has absorbed some of the powers of an elemental or other magic object (perhaps by consuming it). This act taints the magus, so that any being with a Magic Might associated with the Form of this Virtue can sense his nature when nearby. Typically, weak creatures will be afraid of the magus and powerful ones will

attempt to kill him. Whenever casting a spell or performing a Laboratory Activity that requires vis of the chosen Form, the magus may substitute Long-Term Fatigue Levels for the vis. Each Long-Term Fatigue Level lost reduces the vis requirement of the spell or effect by 1. When casting a spell the Fatigue Levels are lost after the spell is cast. For Laboratory Activities the Fatigue loss lasts for the duration of the Laboratory process (that is, at least a season), and Fatigue Levels substituted for vis do not count towards the magi's limit of vis expenditure in a season. The magus takes the

Fatigue Penalty to his Lab Total.

Note that studying vis is not a Laboratory activity, so the magus may not substitute Fatigue Levels for vis when studying.

For example, a magus casting an Enchantment of the Scrying Pool ritual (InAq 30, page 322), requires 6 pawns of some combination of Intellego and Aquam vis. If the magus is Imbued with the Spirit of Aquam, he may

tire himself (losing three Long Term Fatigue Levels), and reduce the vis requirement by 3.

<span id="immune-to-disease"></span>
==== Immune to Disease ====

Major, Supernatural, Tainted The character is marked as the property of a very powerful demon, and the lesser demons that cause most diseases refuse to harm him. Even characters who turn against their masters retain this protection, because the mark is indelible, and disease demons are not usually very bright. A few diseases, for example, those sent as scourges by God, affect the character normally.

<span id="immunity-to-cold"></span>
==== Immunity to Cold ====

Minor, Supernatural Normal cold does not harm you, nor does it make you feel\nuncomfortable. You do not need warm environments to remain healthy.

Extreme, magically created cold, such as the effect of Wizard's Icy Grip (page 346), still affects you normally.

<span id="improved-characteristics"></span>
==== Improved Characteristics ====

Minor, General You have an additional three points to spend on buying Characteristics, but you are still limited to a maximum score of +3 in any single Characteristic\nunless you take the Virtue Great Characteristic. You may take this Virtue multiple times.

<span id="indescribable-face"></span>
==== Indescribable Face ====

Minor, General After meeting this character, other characters usually find it hard to describe him sufficiently well to separate him from others. Some forgettable characters are just average height and weight, with unremarkable features. Others have a particular feature which is so striking it crowds out other memories. He has an ostentatious hat. She was carrying a little dog. The characters can recall the striking feature, but little else. A player who selects this Virtue for his character needs to select which form of the Virtue his character has.

A character who is simply average is always forgettable. He

can't turn the ability off and may use props when building a Reputation among other criminals. He may be &quot;that guy in the black gloves who strangles people,&quot; for example, although no-one recalls precisely what he looks like. Intimately related characters can eventually become sufficiently used to the character's forgettable face that they remember it.

A character who distracts with a prop is memorable when she wishes to be. She can simply not use her devices of distraction if she wishes to make an impression. She can also switch her distracting prop. For example if she hears that someone is looking for a lady with a curious dog, she might switch to a baby, or a curious hat. A character who distracts with props is usually not recognized by random people in crowds (whose eyes also follow the prop, not the face), but this protection is less perfect than a truly forgettable face.

<span id="independent-study"></span>
==== Independent Study ====

Minor, General The character develops new skills extremely quickly on his own. When he is studying through Practice, add two to the Source Quality, and add three to the Source Quality of his Adventure experience.

<span id="induction"></span>
==== Induction ====

Major, Supernatural The character has the supernatural power to make people experience things that are not there. She gains the Supernatural Ability Induction (page 166) with a score of 1.

<span id="ineslemen"></span>
==== Ineslemen ====

Minor, Social Status This character is a member of one of the designated religious tribes of the Tuareg and is therefore accorded some authority over disputes and immunity from the usual feudal demands of the nobles. He may purchase Theology: Islam, Islamic Law and (Realm) Lore during character generation and gains an additional 50 XP to

spend on these Abilities. The character begins with the Minor Flaw Noncombatant, which does not yield any points for buying Virtues. This Social Status only exists in North Africa.

<span id="infernal-heirloom"></span>
==== Infernal Heirloom ====

Minor, Supernatural, Tainted Infernal heirlooms are magical items that the character inherits from a diabolist, or, more rarely, finds. The character has the use of the item, without having to deal with the demon that created it. The item is extremely useful in some way, but each use draws its owner closer to the character, as the demon attempts to reclaim its treasure.

Most Infernal heirlooms have only a single effect, and they are usually triggered by a minor act of, or intention to, sin. As a guideline, each heirloom may create an effect once per day that is equivalent to a Hermetic spell of level 25. Items that produce less powerful effects may be used more frequently at the troupe's discretion.

<span id="inoffensive-to-beings"></span>
==== Inoffensive to (Beings) ====

Minor, General and Hermetic This Virtue is associated with one of five classes of beings: animals, divine beings, faeries, demons, or magical creatures. These last four include characters associated with the Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic realm, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Might.

The character's Gift does not bother beings of this sort, although it still has the normal effects on others. For example, Inoffensive to Animals makes it easier for her to get along with mundane beasts. Animals who react positively to The Gift still react positively to her, since she does have The Gift, but those that do not are not disturbed by her presence.

You may not take this Virtue more than once; characters who are Inoffensive to more than one type of being should take Gentle Gift instead. UnGifted characters may take this Virtue only if they have the Flaw Magical Air.

Note that Inoffensive to Mundane Humans is not available as a Minor Virtue; take Gentle Gift instead.

<span id="inspirational"></span>
==== Inspirational ====

Minor, General You are a stirring speaker or a heroic figure, and can urge people to great efforts. You give targets a +3 bonus to rolls for appropriate Personality Traits.

<span id="intuition"></span>
==== Intuition ====

Minor, General You have a natural sensitivity that allows you to make the right decisions more often than luck can account for. Whenever you are given a choice in which luck plays a major role (such as deciding which of three unexplored paths to follow), you have a good chance of choosing correctly. The storyguide should secretly roll a simple die. On a 6+, your intuition kicks in and you make whatever might be considered the &quot;right&quot; decision. Otherwise, you fail to get any flash of insight and must make the decision without aid.

<span id="inventive-genius"></span>
==== Inventive Genius ====

Minor, Hermetic Invention comes naturally to you. You get +3 to your Lab Total if you are not using a Laboratory Text or being taught. If you experiment, you get +6.

<span id="jack-of-all-trades"></span>
==== Jack-of-All-Trades ====

Minor, General The character is capable of turning his hand to almost anything. He suffers no additional botch dice for attempting an Ability roll for an Ability that he has no score in (see page 157). If it is an asterisked Ability, then he can attempt a roll as if he had a

score of zero with three extra botch dice, if and only if he is normally able to take Abilities of that type. Characters without this Virtue cannot even attempt rolls on an asterisked Ability without at least one experience point in it. For example, he must have a Virtue permitting him to take Arcane Abilities to attempt an unskilled Magic Lore roll. Some Abilities are excepted from this Virtue, including those that are not rolled (such as Parma Magica or Penetration), and all Supernatural Abilities (which require a specific Virtue for each Ability, rather than the type). The troupe may make other exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but this Virtue is supposed to allow the character to attempt things that would normally require training.

<span id="journeyman"></span>
==== Journeyman ====

Minor, Social Status The character is a trained guild craftsman and may practice his trade in town under guild supervision. He works for a master for a wage.

<span id="jurist"></span>
==== '''Jurist''' ====

Minor, Social Status The character is a judge, advocate, or procurator essentially a medieval lawyer in some capacity. At character generation he may purchase the Abilities Latin, Artes Liberales, and Civil and Canon Law. He is not necessarily university trained, as he may have obtained his education through private schools, tutors, or a cathedral school, and need not have a degree. If he is a cleric, he works in an ecclesiastical setting: the papal curia, the College of Cardinals, or a bishop's or archbishop's office. If he is a

layman, he works for a secular prince or town municipality.

This Virtue is compatible with the Baccalaureus, Magister in Artibus, and Doctor in (Faculty) Virtues, as a jurist may have a university education. It is also compatible with the Priest and Mendicant Friar Virtues. It is only available to male characters.

<span id="just-an-instant"></span>
==== Just an Instant ====

Minor, General A character with this Virtue, who has had a few seconds to look about a room, does not need to make Awareness checks to detect or remember anything of interest on the room's exposed surfaces. Some characters use this Virtue to discover the layout of a space so they can navigate it in the dark, while others use it to save time while stealing. Characters with this Virtue are also useful lab assistants, because they know where everything is, and are aware of experiments about to critically fail.

<span id="kassalan-exorcism"></span>
==== Kassalan Exorcism ====

Minor, Supernatural You are capable of performing minor exorcism spells through your knowledge of the rites of the Mortuary Society of Kassala in Alodia, the most remote of the three Nubian kingdoms on the southern reaches of the Nile. You can cast spells in a very limited focus, namely wards against ghosts and the physical dead (using the Rego Corpus or Rego Mentem guidelines), and spells to strip Might from these same beings (using the Perdo Vim guidelines). You cannot create spells that affect other spirits or creatures who are not the walking dead, but your spells are equally effective against creatures from any Realm. Wards created with this Virtue need not be circular, but can instead block the threshold(s) of a room; this is still treated as a Duration: Ring, Target: Circle spell for level calculations.

To cast a spell you must expend a Fatigue level, whether the spell succeeds or fails. You must also spend at least 5 minutes preparing the spell, during which time you need unbroken

<span id="kassalan-dust"></span>
== Kassalan Dust ==

Made by the Mortuary Society of Kassala, this dust has powdered gold as its main component, with myrrh and other spices making up the rest. Twenty handfuls contain about a Mythic Pound's worth of gold dust. Kassalan Dust is necessary for Kassalan Exorcism, but grants no bonus. A handful also adds +3 to\nuses of the Corpse Magic Supernatural Ability to command

a corpse to return to its grave or prevent it from being affected by Corpse Magic. Multiple handfuls provide no additional effect. Kassalan Dust has a Shape &amp; Material bonus of +3 against the dead. The recipe is known to anyone with Organization Lore: Mortuary Society.

More details on the Kassalan Mortuary Society can be found in Lands of the Nile, from page 88.

concentration and expend one handful of Kassalan Dust. The spell is designed exactly like a Hermetic spell; if affecting a ghost you must be able to sense your target. Your Casting Total is equal to (Stamina + Organization Lore: Mortuary Society + Aura modifier + stress die) / 2. Penetration is calculated in the normal fashion: Casting Total – Spell Level + Penetration modifiers. Kassalan Exorcism is aligned to the Magic Realm.

<span id="keen-vision"></span>
==== Keen Vision ====

Minor, General You can see farther and more clearly than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving sight, not including attacks with missile weapons.

<span id="keen-sense-of-smell"></span>
==== Keen Sense of Smell ====

Minor, General The character's nose is more sensitive than normal for a human. He gets a +3 bonus to all rolls involving his sense of smell, including following tracks with the Hunt Ability.

<span id="knight"></span>
==== Knight ====

Minor, Social Status You are a knight, a member of the noble classes and one of the elite warriors of Europe. Unless you are Poor, you may have high quality weapons and armor, and a horse. Typical armaments for a mid-13th century knight are lance, sword, heater shield, a complete mail suit, and a warhorse. You may take Martial Abilities during character generation. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. This Virtue is only available to male characters, and is compatible with the Landed Noble Virtue.

<span id="knows-people"></span>
==== '''Knows People''' ====

Minor, General Your social contacts are not\nimportant for what they give you directly: they are\nimportant because they allow you to match up the desires of your various friends. A skilled socialite is a middleman, who\nis owed gratitude for bringing opportunities to his friends,

not someone who demands favors based on friendship.

Once per story or session, a character with this Virtue may ask for a bait for a non-player character. A bait is the beginning of a scene or short, secondary story, outside the main story being told, which if completed allows the character to gain aid from the nominated target. For example, if the player characters are unable to gain the assistance of a nobleman, a player may demand a bait. In the game, this means the character uses his social skills to determine the needs of the nobleman, and to hint that he may know a third person with a solution. If the troupe then plays out a brief scene in which the nobleman's problem is sorted out, he becomes more biddable.

Troupes may veto any use of these connections which spoils the tension and pace of the game.

<span id="laborer"></span>
==== Laborer ====

Free, Social Status The character is a trained worker who practices a trade that is a valuable service to his community, but by which no finished good is produced. Unlike

a peasant, who is an agrarian worker who works at a variety of jobs, a laborer concentrates on one specific endeavor to earn his livelihood, be it hauling wood, washing clothes, cleaning latrines, carrying luggage, or serving food.

<span id="land-regio-network"></span>
==== (Land) Regio Network ====

Minor, Supernatural The character has access to an extensive network of regiones, perhaps located in the depths of many lakes throughout Mythic Europe, or hidden above the clouds in the sky, or buried in

subterranean caves under the ground. The character is associated with one particular type of regio network.

Once the character is in such a regio he may travel to any other regio in the network; travel time is one Diameter regardless of geographic distance. To determine whether the character knows the location of a networked regio in a particular locale an Intelligence + (Area) Lore roll is made against an Ease

Factor of 9. The character knows how to enter these regiones and can, if he chooses, guide other characters into the regiones — although other characters must be able to survive in the environment of the regio. Access to the network may

be ultimately controlled by other characters or powers.

Major, Social Status

You owe fealty and service to a higher noble, and control land, serfs, and men-at-arms. You have half a dozen servants at your manor house, including a couple of bodyguards. Your servants should be controlled by the rest of the troupe. You have sworn an Oath of Fealty, and so it would be reasonable to balance this Virtue with that Flaw. You get the normal points for Oath of Fealty if you do. You are wealthier than most characters, but have no additional free time. You have the power to enforce the law within your fief, but you may not impose the death penalty, nor may you mutilate criminals. Floggings and fines are the normal penalties you impose.

If you are Poor, your fief is either very small, or in a poor area for farming with few other resources. You must spend every season managing it, or it may collapse completely, leaving you effectively landless. You are no wealthier than most average characters, and you have only a couple of servants.

Wealthy Landed Nobles control more than one fief, and have bailiffs or stewards for each, so that they do not need to devote any time to looking after their lands. You are significantly richer than most Wealthy characters, and could afford to build a small castle or a large chapel within a cathedral. You have around fifty servants, including a significant number of warriors.

This Status Virtue is compatible with the Knight Minor Status Virtue, but unlike that Virtue it is available to male and female characters.

<span id="large"></span>
==== Large ====

Minor, General Your Size is +1 instead of 0, so you are between six and seven feet tall. This means that the severity of wounds you take increases in six point intervals rather than five point intervals. (See page 404). You cannot take this Virtue and Giant Blood (page 83), Small Frame (page

145), or Dwarf (page 126).

<span id="lasiq"></span>
==== Lasiq ====

Major, Social Status The character is an experienced assassin of the Nizari Isma'ilis, having successfully completed seven murders at the orders of his grand master, and commands a small band of up to six fida'is. Lasiq may take Martial Abilities at character creation. As for a fida'i, a lasig may be far from home on a mission, either alone or with some fida'i. In such as case, he is pretending to have some other social status, which you should choose. For more details on the Nizaris, see The Cradle and the Crescent, from page 162.

<span id="latent-magic-ability"></span>
==== Latent Magic Ability ====

Minor, General You have a magical quality that has not vet manifested itself. You probably do not realize you have

this capacity; if you are a magus, your master failed to detect it during your apprenticeship. At the storyguide's discretion, this quality might appear spontaneously or because of some relevant event (like drinking faerie wine). This is not The Gift, and the latent ability is more limited than that.

<span id="learn-ability-from-mistakes"></span>
== Learn (Ability) From Mistakes ==

Minor, General

You are able to improve a particular Ability through the expedient of repeated failure. The first time in a given game session that you botch a roll or fail by exactly one point, you gain five experience points in the Ability. The roll must have come up naturally in the course of the story. You may take this Virtue several times, once for each Ability chosen.

Leather Ripper

Minor, Supernatural This character has the supernatural ability to destroy a group of leather objects. This causes metal armor to fall away, as the strips holding it together disintegrate. It destroys the tack of a horseman, forcing a Ride roll, with penalties of up to -9 depending on how dangerous his current maneuvers are. It can destroy the scabbard, belt and boots of a foe, allowing the ripper to flee or attack. This is a PeAn(He) 30 effect with +0 Penetration. The character must concentrate for a moment and spend a Fatigue level to activate the power, but does not need to speak or gesture.

<span id="leper-magus"></span>
==== Leper Magus ====

Major, Hermetic

This Virtue describes the mystic legacy passed on from Tytalus to Hariste's line through the vector of leprosy. This Virtue can only be bought if the character also has the Leprosy Flaw, and is only available to magi trained in House Tytalus. It allows him to draw upon the strength of his body to increase the power of his magic, granting the Life Boost Minor Virtue. He can also draw even deeper into this power if he desires, mortifying his diseaseridden flesh to produce vis to power his own spells. The vis generated in this way can only be used by the magus himself. in spellcasting or laboratory activities (but not study), and cannot be stored in any way in fact, it never leaves his body. By accepting a Light Wound, the magus can infuse a single magical working with three pawns of vis, of any Technique or Form. A Medium Wound supplies six pawns, a Heavy Wound nine pawns, an Incapacitating Wound 12 pawns, and a Deadly Wound (killing the magus) 15 pawns. Any vis that is produced

beyond the magus's capacity to use in the current magical activity is lost, as is any vis surplus to the requirements of the activity to which this power is applied. Leprotic wounds open on the magus's body as he calls upon this power, but not quickly enough to affect the Casting Total of a non-Ritual spell affected by this power. All Lab Totals suffer the wound penalty as normal, as do the Casting Totals of spells that take more than one round to cast (such as Ritual spells). The character makes no Recovery rolls for this wound until the magical activity that the vis is being used for is complete (i.e., at the end of the casting of the spell, or the end of a season for lab work). While this means that the wound cannot get better, it also means that it does not risk worsening. Since the power is expressed from the pain of this wound, magic used to negate that pain also negates the benefits of this Virtue. A wound taken in this fashion must heal completely before the power may be used again, and any character using this power more than three times a year must make an extra Aging roll in winter

<span id="lesser-benediction"></span>
==== Lesser Benediction ====

Minor, Supernatural You have been blessed by some supernatural power. The effects of the benediction should be comparable to other Minor Virtues. (See insert for examples.)

<span id="lesser-immunity"></span>
==== Lesser Immunity ====

Minor, Supernatural You are immune to some hazard which is either rare, or not deadly, or both. See Greater Immunity, page 83.

<span id="lesser-power"></span>
==== Lesser Power ====

Minor, Supernatural The character has a supernatural power that he can activate at will. This is one or more powers, equivalent to Formulaic Hermetic spells with total levels of 25 or lower. Each power has an Initiative equal to the character's Quickness - (twice power magnitude). It costs one Fatigue level to activate if its level is less than or equal to 25, two Fatigue levels if its level is 26 to 50, and so on. Note that powers with a level of 26 or higher cost less Fatigue if created using the Greater Power Virtue. You may also spend levels onefor-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the levels added together to create several powers. For example, a character who took the Virtue twice could have a power with a level of 30 and a Penetration of 0, and a second power with a level and Penetration of 10 each.

This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, or Hedge Magic Revised Edition, you

<span id="lesser-benediction-examples"></span>
== Lesser Benediction Examples ==

<span id="gift-of-the-gab"></span>
==== Gift of the Gab ====

You are a very convincing speaker, anyone attempting to detect untruth in your words receives a -3 penalty to their rolls.

<span id="green-fingers"></span>
==== Green Fingers ====

Plants always prosper under your care. Your crops never suffer from natural diseases or pests so long as you personally tend to them, and you can therefore get half as much again in terms of yield as others.

<span id="pricking-thumbs"></span>
==== '''Pricking Thumbs''' ====

If you are in the presence of someone who bears you ill will, you feel a pricking sensation in your thumbs. You cannot distinguish one enemy from a crowd with this ability.

<span id="unusually-fecund"></span>
==== '''Unusually Fecund''' ====

Every sexual encounter with a partner of the opposite sex results in conception.

may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character. If you do, remember that the levels of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the number of levels of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)

Lesser Purifying Touch

Minor, Supernatural You can, with a touch and the expenditure of a Fatigue level, heal a specific illness. This illness should be one that people often recover from on their own, or one that is not particularly serious. You can only choose an illness, not an injury or other misfortune. See page 406 for rules on diseases, and Art and Academe, page 45 for more detail.

<span id="license-of-absence"></span>
==== License of Absence ====

Major, General This priest character has a license of absence that relieves him from some duties. The license might be valid for only a few years or it could be valid indefinitely. The character has an extra free season each year, but sometimes it is expected that the extra season is used for study. This Virtue is compatible with the Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw. A Wealthy priest with a license of absence thus has the whole year free; a character can never have more than four free seasons in a year. A license of absence may only be taken by a character with the Priest Social Status. It may not be taken by Senior Clergy.

<span id="life-boost"></span>
==== Life Boost ====

Minor Hermetic

You may boost your Formulaic or Ritual spell casting totals by expending additional Fatigue levels. Each Fatigue level gives you an additional bonus of +5 on the roll, which can yield very impressive Penetration totals. You may burn more Fatigue levels than you possess. If you do, you must Soak damage, without

the help of armor. The Damage total is 5 for every additional Fatigue level spent, plus a stress die. Thus, if you spend three additional levels, you must Soak a damage of 15 + stress die, with vour Soak (no armor) + stress die. Fatigue levels spent in this way are spent regardless of the success or failure of the casting roll, and any wounds taken are similarly taken even if you fail to cast the spell. You can kill yourself doing this. The total number of Fatigue levels to be used must be committed before the casting roll is made.

<span id="life-linked-spontaneous-magic"></span>
==== Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic ====

Major, Hermetic You can do more with spontaneous magic than most magi at the cost of your own life energy. When you decide to use this ability in casting a spontaneous spell, you declare the level of effect you wish to produce before rolling. This level may include a number of levels of Penetration (see page 169). For example, you can choose to cast a level 10 effect at level 20, to give a Penetration of 10 plus your Penetration score.

Roll to cast a Fatiguing Spontaneous spell. If your result after division is higher than the level you declared, you spend only one Fatigue level as usual. If your result after division is less than the level you declared, you must expend one additional Fatigue level per five points (or fraction thereof) by which you missed the target level. If you run out of Fatigue levels, you take a wound. The number of levels still needed for the spell is treated as the amount by which a Damage total exceeds your Soak, and you take the corresponding wound. You can kill vourself this way.

A maga with this Virtue may still cast Fatiguing Spontaneous spells normally.

<span id="light-touch"></span>
=== Light Touch ===

Minor, General

You have especially good handeye coordination and great proficiency for using your hands in precise, fast ways. You gain +1 to all rolls involving subtle manipulation of objects (like picking pockets) and roll one less botch die than vou normally would in such activities (minimum of one). This bonus does not apply to archery, but does apply to playing musical instruments.

<span id="lightning-reflexes"></span>
==== Lightning Reflexes ====

Minor, General You respond to surprises almost instantly. In fact, your reflexes are sometimes so fast that you don't have a chance to think about how you are going to respond. Whenever you are surprised or startled, roll a stress die + Quickness. If you get a 3 or better, you respond reflexively. You must tell the storyguide on each occasion what one type of action (attacking, blocking, running, etc.) you would like to respond with. If attacking in response, you gain +9 to your Initiative Total. The storyguide is the final arbiter of what happens (though it is always in the best interests of your immediate selfpreservation). You only react to threats that you are not fully aware of, so you don't get a bonus against an assassin you watch sneak up on you. Note that you do not get a choice about whether to react. You could just as easily skewer a friend sneaking up in fun as you would an assassin about to strike. Also note that you must perceive an action to react to it - you can still be easily killed in your sleep. This Virtue gives you no special powers of perception.

<span id="linguist"></span>
==== Linguist ====

Minor, General You are extremely proficient learning new languages. All Advancement Totals for any Language are increased by a quarter, rounded up, as are any experience points you put into any language at character generation. Both Living and Dead languages are augmented with this Virtue.

<span id="lone-redcap"></span>
==== Lone Redcap ====

Minor, Social Status You are a Redcap who does not maintain ties to a Mercer House, and thus do not receive magic

items or Longevity Rituals. You still begin with 300 experience points for your fifteen years spent as an apprentice, and receive the benefits of the Well-Traveled virtue, but you are estranged from the other Redcaps in your area, and have a poor Reputation at level 2 within your House.

You must still devote two seasons each year carrying messages and performing other services for the Order, for if you do not there is the possibility you will be declared Orbus and thrown out of your House. This work pays enough for you to live on if you do not belong to a covenant, unless you take the Poor flaw and must work a third season as well. If you take the Wealthy virtue, you can maintain your position with only a single season of effort each year.

This social status is compatible with any other mundane Social Status Virtue that would reasonably allow you to do your job as a Redcap, such as Merchant or Mendicant Friar.

<span id="long-winded"></span>
==== Long-Winded ====

Minor, General You can last longer when\nexerting yourself than most, and gain +3 on all your Fatigue rolls. This bonus does not apply to casting spells.

<span id="luck"></span>
==== Luck ====

Minor, General You perform well in situations where luck is more of a factor than skill or talent. You get +1 to +3 (storyguide's discretion) on rolls in such situations, depending upon how much luck\nis involved. You do well at games of chance, but may be labeled a cheater if you play them too often.

<span id="lupus-the-wolf"></span>
==== Lupus (the Wolf) ====

Minor, Social Status The character is employed by a university to watch over the students and ensure that they speak only Latin in their colleges and hostels. He is a member of the urban community where the university is located. He may begin play with scores in Latin or Artes

Liberales, although a score of more than 1 in Artes Liberales would be rare. He may live with the students if he is unmarried, but if he has a family then he lives with them, possessing keys to the students' housing to allow unannounced entry. It would be very unusual for such a character to be female, but it is not impossible.

<span id="magian-lineage"></span>
==== Magian Lineage ====

Minor or Major, General This Virtue makes the character a true blood descendent of the Median tribe of Magians, the original priestly caste of Persia. Many mobeds, the priests of Zoroastrianism, possess this Virtue, either Minor or Major, but it is not a requisite. Details about Mythic Zoroastrianism can be found in The Cradle and the Crescent, Chapter 5.

Minor: Your character's lineage is weak, although he or she is still ethnically Magian, and gains a strong constitution due to his purity. The character gains a –1 bonus to Aging rolls and a +3 bonus to resist the effects of disease.

Major: In addition to the benefits of the Minor Virtue, your character has an affinity with the ancient prophetic and other mystical arts of their ancestors. The player must choose three Arcane or Supernatural Abilities which the character need not start play with, and which cannot be True Names. These Abilities are considered connected, so that whenever your character gains experience from a source dedicated to one of these Abilities, he gains half the Source Quality (round up) in experience points in each of the other two Abilities. A character must have access to a Supernatural Ability in one of the normal ways, such as taking the Virtue at character creation or Initiating it later, in order to put any experience points into it. If you choose a Supernatural Ability that your character does not yet have access to, any experience points generated for it by this Virtue before the character gains access to the Ability are lost.

<span id="magic-items"></span>
==== Magic Items ====

Minor, General

You begin with 25 more starting levels of magic items than you would otherwise, and the rate at which your items are improved is increased by one level per year. This is probably because of your exceptional devotion to the House, or because you have inherited a number of items from other Redcaps. You must be a Redcap to take this Virtue, and you may take it more than once, though no single effect in any of your items can be greater than Level 30.

<span id="magic-sensitivity"></span>
==== Magic Sensitivity ====

Minor, Supernatural You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical\neffects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from your Magic Resistance. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Magic Sensitivity 1 (page 168).

<span id="magical-memory"></span>
==== Magical Memory ====

Minor, Hermetic Your memory has been developed to remember magical rather than mundane things. You need not keep laboratory texts (see page 262) of your creations to get the benefit of a Lab Text when reproducing them. If you have created an effect by following another magus's Lab Text once, you may get the same benefit in future without needing to have the text available.

<span id="magical-blood"></span>
==== Magical Blood ====

Minor, Supernatural The character's essential nature has been improved through exposure to the Magic realm, often from a magic being, which gives her true form special supernatural properties. This typically changes the character's appearance enough that others can recognize that there is something unusual about her, and people might say that she has magical blood — or &quot;faerie blood&quot; (since many people in Mythic Europe do not understand the differences between the Magic and Faerie realms).

The character may learn Magic Lore during character creation, and is resistant to aging, receiving a –1 bonus to all of her Aging rolls. In addition, she receives a minor physical advantage appropriate to one of the four different types of magic beings (magic animals, magic humans, magic spirits, and magic things), the one that is associated with the character's background. Some examples are below, or you can make up your own.

Magic Animal: The character has a physical feature normally associated with animals, such as wings, scales, gills, teeth, or claws. These give as much as a +3 bonus to appropriate activities, or may allow the character to perform actions that a normal character could not manage (such as fly, or breathe underwater). This feature is very difficult to hide, making the character obviously different from other humans

Magic Human: The character may increase one of his Characteristics by 1, but not above +3. This is often Strength or Stamina (to represent the blood of giant ancestors), or Presence (to represent the blood of god-like beings). This often gives the character an otherworldly appearance. The character also has a positive Reputation at

level 3 among others of his bloodline.

Magic Spirit: The character gains an appropriate Supernatural Ability (one associated with a Minor Virtue), such as Magic Sensitivity, Premonitions, Second Sight, or Wilderness Sense, with an initial score of 1, though whenever the character uses this Ability, her appearance becomes obviously supernatural. For example, her eyes might turn black, she might rise a foot from the ground, or her hair might be blown about by a wind no one else can feel.

Magic Thing: The character has a Lesser or Personal Power associated with an object or thing. Whenever she activates the effect, her appearance also changes in a way appropriate to the form of the power. For example, a power that protects against flames would cause her skin to become dark with soot and smell like smoke, and a power that lets her walk on water might cause her to become semitransparent, like water.

<span id="magical-mount"></span>
==== Magical Mount ====

Minor, General The character has a mount, beast-of-burden, or &quot;guard dog,&quot; a creature that has Cunning instead of Intelligence and a Magic Might Score of up to 25. It has an extra Personality Trait (Loyal 0) and will obey simple verbal commands. If it has a positive Cunning score, the creature is also able to perform limited acts on its own initiative. If the character is incapable of training the creature himself, it must have been a gift from another character (probably a powerful magus) and the character must take a Major Story Flaw to represent the consequences: Favors, to represent his debt to his patron, is the simplest, but Enemies, if the mount was lured away, is also a possibility. In this case, only a companion or magus-level character can take this Virtue.

<span id="magical-warder"></span>
==== Magical Warder ====

Major, General The character has a magical being that accompanies him, watches over him, and sees that he comes to no harm. It does not require anything from the character in return for its service, but note that the more powerful the warder, the less willing or able it is to help the character, and the less often it is available to protect him.

A classic example is the ghost of someone close to the character. The ghost is invisible and silent to anyone but you, unless they have Second Sight or some other supernatural means of detecting it. It can see and hear what is going on around you, and leave your presence for up to half a day, so it makes a good spy. See page 457 for example statistics for such a Magical Warder.

Design this being as a magic character, using the guidelines in Chapter 13, or in ''Realms of Power: Magic'' — a ghostly warder is a good example of a companion character; it is less powerful and basically an extension of the character's will, while a more powerful Warder's assistance is rarer and even more circumstantial.

<span id="magister-in-artibus"></span>
==== Magister in Artibus ====

Major, Social Status You have incepted Master of Arts\nin one of the universities of Europe (Paris, Bologna, Oxford, Cambridge, Montpellier, Arezzo or Salamanca) and completed your two years' regency of compulsory teaching. You are entitled to be addressed as Magister, are subject only to canon law, and may teach anywhere in Europe.

You are at least (25 – Int) years old, and must have scores of at least 5 in Latin and Artes Liberales. You have, however, spent eight years in a university, and gain an additional 30 experience points in each of those years, for a total of 240 additional experience points over and above your allowance based on age. You may buy Academic Abilities during character generation, and must spend your additional experience points on Academic

Abilities or Teaching. You have an Academic Reputation of 2.

You must spend two seasons teaching to maintain yourself and your reputation as a dependable instructor. These two seasons are spread between September and June, so you are genuinely free in the summer. If you take the Poor Flaw, you are still genuinely free in the summer. If you take the Wealthy Virtue, you can maintain your reputation with a single season's teaching.

This Virtue is only available to male characters, and is compatible with the Hermetic Magus, Mendicant Friar, and Priest Virtues.

<span id="magister-in-medicina"></span>
==== Magister in Medicina ====

Major, Social Status The character has achieved a doctorate in medicine from one of the medical schools of Europe (Salerno, Cremona, Montpellier, or Bologna), and completed his two years' compulsory teaching. This Virtue offers the same benefits as Doctor in (Faculty). This Virtue is compatible with the Hermetic Magus, and Priest Virtues. Note that this Virtue is available to female characters, although they must have graduated from Salerno; male characters may have graduated from any of the medical schools.

<span id="major-magical-focus"></span>
==== Major Magical Focus ====

Major, Hermetic

Your magic is much more potent in a fairly limited area, such as weather, necromancy, birds, or emotions. This area should be smaller than a single Art, but may be spread over several Arts – necromancy, for example, covers both Corpus and Mentem effects. You cannot be focused on laboratory activities, although a focus does apply to laboratory activities.

When you cast a spell or generate a Lab Total within your focus, add the lowest applicable Art score twice. If a spell has requisites, the lowest applicable score may be one of the requisites, rather than one of the primary Arts. Thus, if a magus with a focus on birds was casting a spell to turn a bird into pure

flame, MuAn (Ig), with Muto 14, An 18, and Ig 10, his final total would be 34 + other modifiers: 14 from Muto, and 20 from adding Ignem twice. If he was casting a spell to turn a bird into another sort of bird, MuAn with no requisites, his total would be 46 + other modifiers, 18 from Animal and 28 from adding Muto twice.

A character can have only one Magical Focus, either major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.

<span id="maker-of-textured-vessels"></span>
==== Maker of Textured Vessels ====

Minor, Supernatural

Textured vessels are those which have mystical patterns impressed into their surfaces before firing. A character with this Virtue has a repertoire of shapes: one shape per level in the Craft: Potter Ability. Each shape corresponds to an Ability, and the character gains additional shapes as the Craft skill increases. The character takes one season to learn each added shape when her Ability increases, and requires the assistance of someone who already knows the new shape desired.

Crafting a vessel costs one Long-Term Fatigue level. Each vessel grants a +3 bonus in a single Ability. The materials used while attempting the roll must have been stored inside the vessel. Storing materials for Abilities in pots does not cause Warping. The first time a character uses a pot in this way, it accepts the user as its owner, and provides no bonus for anyone else. A pot is an Arcane Connection to its master. Characters with Magic Resistance cannot be claimed by pots, and gain no benefit from them.

A separate version of this Virtue allows the character to make leather vessels, and relies on Craft: Leatherworker. It is otherwise identical. In the African cultures where this Virtue is most common, the pottery version is associated with women, and the leather version with men, but this does not limit which characters can take either Virtue.

<span id="sample-major-magical-poci"></span>
== Sample Major Magical Poci ==

This list is merely exemplary. Other foci are possible.

* Animal: Birds, or mammals, or domesticated animals.
* Aquam: Salt water or fresh water.

* Imaginem: Visual images, auditory images, tactile images, or taste and smell together.
* Mentem: Emotions or memories.
* Terram: Metals or stone.
* Necromancy: Corpus and Mentem as applied to the bodies and spirits of dead people.
* Damage: Any Art, as long as the effect does damage directly, either by inflicting a wound or doing a certain amount of damage which can be soaked.
* Disguise: Changing the appearance of something, by any means.

<span id="maker-of-water-vessels"></span>
==== Maker of Water Vessels ====

Minor, Supernatural

A character who drinks from a magical water vessel made by a character with this Virtue may swap one Ability score for the Craft: Potter score of the crafter at the time the vessel was made. This effect lasts for one scene or three minutes, whichever is longer. Each vessel is tied, at its creation, to a particular Ability, by its shape.

Each character knows a variety of vessel shapes, each shape corresponding to a single Ability. A starting character knows a number of shapes equal to her Craft: Potter score. The character takes one season to learn a new shape when her Ability increases, and requires the assistance of someone who already knows the new shape desired. Making a vessel costs a Long-Term Fatigue level.

After a vessel is drunk from the first time, it takes the drinker as its owner. Other drinkers gain no benefit from the vessel, and it becomes an Arcane Connection to its owner. Characters with Magic Resistance cannot be claimed by vessels. The first drink from an unowned vessel, which establishes ownership, causes Warping, unless the drinker has Supernatural Virtues. Similarly, drinking from a vessel one does not own causes Warping, unless the drinker has Supernatural Virtues.

A separate version of this Virtue allows the character to make leather vessels, and relies on Craft: Leatherworker. It is otherwise identical. In the African cultures where this Virtue is most common, the pottery version is associated with women, and the leather version with men, but this does

not limit which characters can take either Virtue.

<span id="male-guild-sponsor"></span>
==== Male Guild Sponsor ====

Free, Social Status The character's father or husband is a guild craftsman and she has been allowed entry into his field of work, which is otherwise restricted to men. The character may work at her trade, following the same procedures as the regular male workers. Every guild allows such members, so she may practice any craft she desires. The character must select a separate guild Social Status Virtue as well as this free Virtue to represent her status in the guild system. This Virtue is only available to female characters, and is compatible with all Social Status Virtues reflecting status in a guild.

<span id="mamluk"></span>
==== Mamluk ====

Minor, Social Status You are a former military slave, bought as a child, trained at a military school and educated in Islam, and then freed upon reaching adulthood. You are probably Turkish, but you may also be Mongol or even Greek. You are likely to have been trained in the use of lances, bows, shields, chainmail, and lamellar armor (same statistics as chainmail) and one or two swords, both on foot and on horseback, though this does not necessarily mean that you will own these at the start of the game (storyguide's option).

You may take Martial Abilities at character creation, and as a special case you may also take the Ability Theology: Islam, even if you do not have the Minor General Virtue Educated. This Virtue is only available to male characters, and (for Companion characters only) is compatible with both the Emir and Muqta' Virtues, as many Mamluks have climbed high in the Muslim hierarchy.

<span id="marshal"></span>
==== Marshal ====

Minor, Social Status A noble's stables require a specialist to coordinate the care, feeding, and welfare of the animals. This person is called a marshal, and the title holds considerable honor. The Marshal of England is the king's official in charge of his cavalry, but even the marshal of a baron is an important personage, given the vital roles played by horses in warfare and hunting, as well as routine travel.

A marshal should take the Ability Profession: Marshal, which deals with understanding, purchasing, and caring for horses. It functions as the Ability Medicine for the purpose of treating veterinary diseases, and for surgery involving these animals. A marshal receives 50 extra experience points at character generation to spend on the abilities Animal Handling, Etiquette, Hunt, Latin, Profession: Marshal and Ride, and may take Martial Abilities freely.

A marshal may overseen other specialists, including farriers who make horseshoes, leatherworkers who produce tack, harness, and saddles, and the trained staff who administer day-to-day grooming and mucking out of the stables.

<span id="master-bard"></span>
==== Master Bard ====

Major, Social Status The character has spent at least nine years of study at a bardic school and is a master of the trade, called an Anruth. He has a teaching position at a prestigious school, or else an official position with an Irish clan chief; either way this earns him a Local Reputation at level 3. If resident at a school, he has an obligation to teach for at least two seasons a year; if he works for a lord, two seasons are instead spent composing praise poems and stories for his patron.

The character should be at least 25 years old, and must have a Profession: Storyteller or Poet of at least 5, and also a 5 in at least one of Area Lore, Organization Lore, Faerie Lore, or Magic Lore. You can spend experience points on Arcane Abilities at character creation, and have an extra 240 experience points to spend on Art of Memory, Profession: Storyteller, Profession: Poet, any Area Lore, any Organization Lore, Faerie Lore, or Magic Lore. This Social Status is only available in Ireland.

<span id="master-of-form-creatures"></span>
==== Master of (Form) Creatures ====

Minor, Supernatural The character can tame animals and other unintelligent beings whose Magic Might is aligned with a particular Form. During character creation, the character may take Magic Lore, and this Virtue may be taken multiple times, once for each Form. See page 384 for rules for training magical (and mundane) animals.

<span id="master-of-kennels"></span>
==== Master of Kennels ====

Minor, Social Status The character manages the kennels for a noble patron, and is responsible for the training, breeding, and health of the animals. He has an appropriate

staff under him, depending on the size of the kennels, and often possesses the privilege of riding with the hunt. He may be considered an intimate and important member of the noble household, despite his common birth, and be treated with commensurate respect. He is also expected to organize the huntsmen — that is, the dog handlers — and train servants or locals to perform that role. He should possess the Ability Profession: Master of Kennels, which governs the care of the dogs, treatment of their diseases, and acquisition and breeding of hounds. The Ability Animal Handling is used for the

training of the animals. A master of kennels receives 50 extra experience points at character generation to spend on the abilities Animal Handling, Etiquette, Hunt, Latin, Profession: Master of Kennels, and Ride, and may take Martial Abilities freely.

<span id="mastered-spells"></span>
==== Mastered Spells ====

Minor, Hermetic You have fifty experience points to spend on mastering spells that you know. (See page 225 for rules on mastering spells.) You may take this Virtue if you also have Flawless Magic, to

also have Flawless Magic, to give you more experience points to spend on mastering your spells. You may take this Virtue multiple times.

Masterpiece

Minor, Hermetic

For some benevolent reason, the magus's parens has allowed him to keep the lesser enchanted item he made to prove himself a magus and pass his Gauntlet. This masterpiece must be a lesser enchanted item. You should design a lesser enchanted item that your character could make based on his Lab Totals at character generation, following the regular rules for construction of such a device. You ignore vis costs, as the magus's parens provided those from her laboratory stores. This Gauntlet test is standard for House Verditius, but a maga from another House may have chosen to impose it.

Mazdean Priest

Minor, Social Status

Your character is an ordained Mazdean priest, initiated as a mobed. This means that the character may carry out the various rituals and ceremonies, such as the Yasna, Vivevdat, Navjote, marriage, burial, official prayers, purification rituals. lighting of sacred fires, and initiation of new priests. In Mazdean communities, your character is held in high regard and treated with great respect. The character wears pure white clothes and, when performing ceremonies, covers his face with a white veil to protect the sacred flame from his breath and saliva. See The Cradle and the Crescent. Chapter 5 for more details on Mythic Zoroastrianism.

As a mobed, your character resides in a community that likely has a fire temple. This means that your character has arduous and time-consuming religious and ceremonial duties. Most of your time is spent praying, performing ritual purification rites and tending to the sacred fire. If you are Wealthy, you have several ervads (junior priests) who perform many of the more arduous tasks. If you are Poor, it likely reflects the poor station of Mazdeans in the community in general, and you may also possess the Outsider Flaw.

Your character may take Academic Abilities at character generation. Most such characters take the Minor Personality Flaw Vow to reflect your constant state of ritual purity, and dedication to your community. This can only be your character's social status if he lives in a Mazdean community, all of which are to the east of Mythic Europe, and most of which are in Persia. A Mazdean priest in exile in Europe should take a different Social Status Virtue or Flaw, as discussed earlier. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

Mendicant Friar

Minor, Social Status You are a follower of St. Francis or St. Dominic going among the rich and poor, spreading the word of God and giving comfort to the sick, homeless, hungry, or dying. You are sworn to serve the Church for the rest of your life, but your wandering habits are considered suspect by the local bishop and parish clergy, and you lack political influence within the organization. Like all clerics, however, you are only subject to canon law.

Due to your training, you may take Academic Abilities during character generation. If you wish, you may be an ordained priest and may officiate at marriages, baptisms, funerals, and the Mass, though the parish clergy may resent your interfering on their &quot;turf.&quot; You do not need to take the Priest Virtue in addition to this one if you do want to be ordained.

You have sworn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, which could together constitute a Major Story Flaw (Monastic Vows, see page 138), and which would be a natural choice if you take this Virtue. You may not take the Wealthy Virtue or Poor Flaw. This Virtue is only available to male characters, and is compatible with the Magister in Artibus Major Virtue.

Mentored by Demons

Minor, General, Tainted A character mentored by demons learns faster than is possible for those studying with human teachers, but demons only teach those Abilities that suit their plans for the character. Characters trained by demons may exceed the maximum skill level for a given age provided by the character creation rules. Students of demons may also have Abilities that are usually restricted to suitable backgrounds. People mentored by demons do not recognize the supernatural nature of their teachers — many consider their exceptional skills an expression of their innate superiority to others. This attitude is particularly common in children afflicted with Pride. Mentored characters have an additional 50 experience points to spend on any Ability. Characters may purchase this Virtue multiple times, and gain 50 further experience points each time. Characters trained to this extreme know that their teachers are supernatural figures, but often have the Manufactured Ignorance Flaw.

<span id="mercenary-captain"></span>
==== Mercenary Captain ====

Minor, Social Status You lead a small company of mercenaries (5 to 10), for hire to the highest bidder. You are much like a knight-errant, only without the prestige. During your travels you have gained great wealth — and squandered\nit — several times over. You may take Martial Abilities during character generation.

If you are Poor, you lead only a couple of other mercenaries, but you and they may have armor and weapons available to normal characters. If you are Wealthy you lead about twenty mercenaries, and can delegate some of the work to sergeants. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.

<span id="merchant"></span>
==== Merchant ====

Free, Social Status You live from the buying and selling of goods. You may be a peddler, if you are relatively poor, a shopkeeper, or a traveling merchant. The Wealthy Major Virtue and Poor Major Flaw affect you normally.

<span id="merchant-adventurer"></span>
==== Merchant Adventurer ====

Minor, Social Status

The character is in command of a ship, and a crew. The character has sufficient capital for a cargo, but may have substantial debts, which may be represented by the Favors Flaw. See ''City and Guild'' for more details on trade. A merchant adventurer who owns a share of the company he works for should select the Partner Virtue instead of this one.

<span id="mercurian-magic"></span>
==== Mercurian Magic ====

Major, Hermetic Your magical lineage and traditions are from the Roman priests of Mercury, which predate the Order of Hermes, making you especially skilled with Ritual Magic and magic used in conjunction with others. In addition to your standard spell allocation, you also know Wizard's Vigil (page 370) at a level equal to the highest level of Ritual spell that you know, and should you invent or learn a Ritual spell of higher level. you automatically invent a Wizard's Vigil spell of the same level, without needing to spend extra time.

When casting a spell using Wizard's Vigil (page 370) or other spells, such as Wizard's Communion (page 369), with the same function, you may add your Mastery score (page 225) in the spell being cast and your Mastery score in Wizard's Vigil to the effective level of the Wizard's Vigil.

Finally, any Ritual spells which you cast have only half the usual vis requirement. If cast as part of a Wizard's Vigil, all the participants need to have this Virtue to gain this benefit.

All known members of the Mercurian lineage also have the Minor Flaw Ceremonial Spontaneous Magic.

<span id="method-caster"></span>
==== Method Caster ====

Minor, Hermetic

You are excellent at formulaic spells, as you have perfected a consistent and precise method for casting them. You gain a +3 bonus to the Casting Total of any Formulaic or Ritual spell you cast. However, if you vary at all from your precise method (by altering your gestures or voicing), you do not get this bonus.

<span id="mild-aging"></span>
==== Mild Aging ====

Minor, General

The character's aging rolls benefit from a +1 bonus to the Living Conditions Modifier, in addition to whatever his social standing normally offers him. Furthermore, he receives a +3 bonus to rolls to survive an aging crisis. He may be dedicated to living a healthy life, or else have been blessed by some supernatural being.

<span id="minor-enchantments"></span>
==== Minor Enchantments ====

Minor, Subernatural The character has one or more items in his possession that have magical powers. These should be designed as Hermetic enchantments, and the total levels of powers in all the items, after adjustment for uses per day and so forth, must be 25 or less. The character may take this Virtue more than once: add the total levels together, but no single power can be greater than 30th level. If he loses the item or it is destroyed, then it is gone for good.

<span id="minor-magical-focus"></span>
==== Minor Magical Focus ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your magic is particularly attuned to some narrow field, such as self-transformation, birds of prey, or healing. In general, the field should be slightly narrower than a single Technique and Form combination, although it may include restricted areas of several such combinations. Healing, for example, is a part of Creo Corpus, Creo Animal, and

<span id="sample-minor-magical-foci"></span>
== Sample Minor Magical Foci ==

This list is merely exemplary; other foci are possible.

* Animal: Birds of prey, canines, mustelidae.
* Aquam: Stagnant water, small streams.
* · Auram: Wind, rain, lightning.
* Corpus: Aging, disease.
* Herbam: Fruiting, wood.
* Imaginem: A particular color or sound.
* Mentem: Anger, lust, erasing memories, changing memories.
* Terram: Creating metals, destroying stone.
* Healing: Applies to people, animals, and plants.
* Self-transformation: Applies to both Corpus and Mentem.

possibly Creo Herbam. You cannot be focused on a laboratory activity, such as creating charged items, although a focus does apply to laboratory activities.

When you cast a spell or generate a Lab Total within your focus, add the lowest applicable Art score twice, as for a Major Magical Focus (page 94).

A magus may only have one Magical Focus, whether major or minor, regardless of the source of the focus.

<span id="mugta-mug-ta"></span>
==== Mugta' (Mug-Ta') ====

Major, Social Status You are an important emir,\nentrusted with an iqta' (iqTAW', similar to a feudal fief). All rules for the Landed Noble Virtue apply, except that most Muslims take the Minor Status Virtue Emir, rather than Knight.

<span id="muse"></span>
==== Muse ====

Minor, Supernatural A muse possesses that rare beauty that encourages others to rise to worthiness. A character with this Virtue may grant Free Expression to a single other character, or can double the\neffect of Free Expression that a single character already possesses, while the muse is

with him. The artist typically holds the muse in such high regard that he feels the need to continually improve, both in artistic technique and as a person, to be worthy of the muse's attention. Muses may be of either sex, and need not have beautiful bodies.

<span id="mystical-choreography"></span>
==== Mystical Choreography ====

Minor, Hermetic The magus's skill at manipulating the shape and movement of the body allows him to reduce the amount of time required to perform Ceremonial Magic. The character performs ceremonies as per page 217, but requires only five minutes per magnitude. If the character has a prepared space, no matter

This Virtue is particularly important to those Jerbiton magi who use ceremonial casting to overcome the penalties associated with the Dominion.

how temporary, this falls to one

minute per magnitude.

<span id="mythic-blood"></span>
==== Mythic Blood ====

Major, Hermetic You are a blood descendant of either a wizard of legend (possibly one of the Twelve Founders, or some other ancient and powerful sorcerer) or a supernatural being (such as a dragon).

Your potent Gift means that you do not lose Fatigue levels if your Casting Total falls short of the level of a formulaic spell by ten points or less, although you do lose Fatigue if the spell fails completely. When casting Ritual spells, lose three fewer Fatigue levels than normal. This means that you lose no Fatigue levels if you succeed, or fail by ten points or less. You must expend Fatigue normally to cast Spontaneous magic, and if you fail to cast a Formulaic spell you lose the normal number of Fatigue levels.

Additionally, you may choose one special magic feat which you can invoke at will and cancel at will, as often as you like. Invoking this feat takes as long as fast-casting a Mastered Formulaic spell (see

page 213), and requires the same level of concentration. The effect should be designed as a non-Ritual Hermetic effect, with a level + Penetration limited as below. The Penetration of the effect is not modified by the magus's Penetration Ability score, and cannot be negative, so that the highest possible level of the effect is 30.

{| class="wikitable"

This Virtue includes a Minor Magical Focus in an area related to your legendary ancestor and a hereditary Minor Personality Flaw (both at no extra cost). Mythic Blood is not particularly uncommon in the Order of Hermes, so this Virtue does not grant any Reputation.

<span id="natural-leader"></span>
==== Natural Leader ====

Minor, General The character is a dominant person with a demeanor that encourages others to do what he says. His self-assured manner gives him a +3 bonus to rolls in social situations in which he takes the lead; people are more likely to follow his orders or do as he suggests. If he is Gifted, this bonus can temporarily help to overcome the social penalty of The Gift, due to the strength of his domineering personality.

<span id="nephilim"></span>
==== Nephilim ====

Free, Mythic Companion You are one of the Nephilim, and a Mythic Companion (page 63). You receive the Strong Angelic Heritage Virtue free.

<span id="notary"></span>
==== Notary ====

Minor, Social Status Notaries are legal officials\nemployed by lords or towns. Your responsibilities include drawing up contracts, witnessing charters, verifying transactions

and documents, and affixing a specially designed seal. Notaries generally receive their salary from their employer on Christmas. Notaries only have jurisdiction in specific realms or towns, such as the County of Nimes or the city of Montpellier. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. Due to your training, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation; however, notaries may not be members of the clergy and are subject to secular law.

<span id="nuntius"></span>
==== Nuntius ====

Free, Social Status The character is a nuntius (messenger), charged with delivering messages, mail, and monetary donations between students and their families. He is\nemployed by a university nation and is not necessarily educated. He is affected by the Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw as normal. The character can be either male or female, although travel\nis obviously more dangerous for a lone female.

<span id="paid-rights"></span>
==== Paid Rights ====

Free, Social Status Medieval society has many prohibitions against women holding authority, reflected in the restriction of many Social Status Virtues to men. These provisions need to be enforced for them to be effective, and a woman with sufficient wealth can often buy an exclusion from enforcement, or even permission to do something that is normally forbidden. All a woman need do, if she wishes to be a baroness in her own right, is pay the king enough money that he allows it. All a woman need do if she wishes to hold a smaller fief in her own right, not marry as directed, and not be in wardship, is pay a large enough fine to her guardian.

A player may take this Virtue to note that a female character has paid for the right to do a certain thing that is generally forbidden for women. She may also take a Story Flaw that represents her family's displeasure at this use of her

funds, the frustrations of suitors who would take her land by marriage, or other forms of social opprobrium, although this is not required.

There are, however, a few prohibitions that a woman cannot pay a fine to ignore. She cannot pay a fine to do anything that only men are permitted to do in the administrative structure of the Church, which includes universities and cathedral schools. She could pay a fine to be allowed to study at a university, but not to graduate and gain the accompanying social status. Similarly, a woman cannot pay a fine to be ordained into Minor or Holy Orders, for example as a priest. It is also difficult for a woman to gain the rank of knight. There are some examples of female knights in folklore, so it is not impossible. But a female knight needs an unusual back story, and really ought to have a Story Flaw reflecting that.

This Virtue is only available to female characters, and is compatible with any Social Status that is normally restricted to men, and any Social Status compatible with the Social Status acquired through the paid rights.

<span id="partner"></span>
==== Partner ====

Major, Social Status The character has a large financial stake in a wealthy trading company. This provides sufficient income for the character to live as well as a minor member of the nobility. but without military trappings. The company's capo is answerable to his partners, and they are permitted, when practicable, to take their profits in service from the house's captains and factors, if they wish. A partner may act in any of the roles of the house without taking the Virtue that corresponds to that role, save the role of capo, with the permission of the troupe. That is, a partner who is also a factor, merchant adventurer, local carrier, or urban merchant need not purchase that Virtue if she has this one.

<span id="peasant"></span>
==== Peasant ====

Free, Social Status You live by working the land. You may control quite a lot of land and hire people to work it, if you are wealthy, or be one of the people who is hired, if you are poor. You are free, rather than a serf. The Wealthy Major Virtue and Poor Major Flaw affect you normally.

<span id="perfect-balance"></span>
==== Perfect Balance ====

Minor, General You are skilled at keeping your balance, especially on narrow ledges or tightropes. Add +6 to any roll to avoid falling or tripping.

<span id="perfect-eye-for-commodity"></span>
==== Perfect Eye for (Commodity) ====

Minor, General For one commodity, and products manufactured from it, the character never fails to make an accurate assessment of value. A character who has a perfect eye for wool, for example, can class wool by touch and always estimate its price accurately. The character can also price woolen cloth and woolen embroidery. A character with a perfect eye for gemstones can always spot fake, cracked, and illusory stones. Characters with this Virtue are prized employees, and are occasionally paid as consultants by other merchants. So long as they trade exclusively in the commodity that matches this Virtue, the character is very successful. If you are using the trading rules in City and Guild, they gain an extra (3 x Wealth Multiplier) Labor Points per year.

<span id="perfectus"></span>
==== Perfectus ====

Minor, Social Status You are one of the leaders of the Cathar heretics, found mainly in southern France. Your responsibilities include preaching the Gospel, abstaining from eating meat and dairy produce, from sex and romance, and from other acts that ensnare you in the sinful world. You should normally take the Flaw: Vow to represent your solemn religious obligations. You may not take the Wealthy Virtue, as you are supported by the tithes and contributions of your

<span id="example"></span>
== '''Example''' ==

Orlando is a musician and magus, and knows Sorcerous Music and Subtle Magic. He may cast spells while he sings (with no penalty for no gestures), plays his lute, or sings and plays. If he sings or plays quietly, he suffers the normal –5 penalty. He can cast spells silently, but only by not using Sorcerous Music.

His friend Furioso, another Sorcerous Musician, lacks Subtle Magic. If he has no instrument with him, then, unlike Orlando, he must use normal Hermetic gestures or suffer the penalty for no gestures.

congregations. As a heretic you are at great risk from the Church, which will execute you if you are caught and refuse to recant your beliefs. Due to your training, you may take Academic Abilities during character creation. You may take the Purity and Transcendence Supernatural Abilities from Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition (page 53) if your character has the True Faith Virtue, but these are not free Virtues. You may, however, take them as Virtues, as normal. More details on the Cathars can be found in Faith and Flame, from page 13.

<span id="performance-magic"></span>
==== Performance Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic In Mythic Europe, many Hermetic magi have learned how to disguise their magical practices by incorporating them fully into a mundane task or action at which they excel. This Virtue lets the magus conceal spellcasting by using the actions or words of some Ability to replace the normal Hermetic gestures and words, and lets him

<span id="example-1"></span>
=== '''Example''' ===

Harold knows Performance Magic (Hunt), casts Hunter's Tracks of the Faerie Glow (a variant of Tracks of the Faerie Glow), and succeeds with his simple Hunt roll. His magically enhanced vision persists as long as he keeps up the hunt, even if he is distracted by chatter or other spellcasting.

Orlando sings while he casts a Sung Lamp Without Flame. The light continues while he continues to sing, however badly, but ends when he stops singing. Needing to convey urgent instructions to a recalcitrant grog, he uses an enchanted device with Maintaining the Demanding Spell to maintain the spell while he stops to shout at the grog; before the Maintaining effect ends he resumes his sung performance.

maintain a spell without needing Concentration rolls.

When the Virtue is acquired, specify the Ability to which it applies. You may choose any Craft, Profession, or other Ability with a clear verbal or physical practice. You may not choose any Language, Supernatural, Academic, or Arcane Ability.

There are distinct Virtues for each possible Ability, as each allows different methods to work its actions into magic: knowing one method of Performance Magic does not let the magus use any other Ability in magic.

It is the action or words of the practice that are the focus of this Virtue, not the products of craft-working. An Ability that is verbal (such as storytelling) replaces the words of spellcasting; similarly, an Ability that is physical (such as hunting) replaces gestures. An Ability that encompasses both verbal and physical aspects (such as music, or mumming (acting)) allows the performer more flexibility.

The magus must actually perform the Ability to count as using this Virtue, and other Virtues or Mastery Abilities do not remove that requirement. For example, he cannot sing silently, although he can hunt silently.

Words or gestures that are not being replaced by Performance Magic remain as normal mystical components of spell-casting: use the normal rules and adjustments (including Virtues such as Quiet Magic and Mastery Abilities such as Still Casting).

The magus may choose to vocalize loudly, or move exaggeratedly, and gain the equivalent bonuses as for loud words or exaggerated gestures. Bystanders may notice this as unusual activity, and take interest where they might not otherwise.

Performance (Duration): The spell lasts as long as the caster performs the Performance Ability. Performance is equivalent to Concentration

To cast a Performance Duration spell, the magus must succeed in a roll (simple or stress die, according to circumstances) of Characteristic (varies with Ability) + Ability against an Ease Factor of 3.

The spell fails if this fails, and botches if the roll botches. The spell ends when the magus ceases to perform the Ability, but no Concentration or Ability rolls are needed to maintain the spell while the performance continues.

Formulaic spells must be devised with the new Duration to use this Ability; if so designed, the spell cannot be cast without performing.

<span id="persona"></span>
==== Persona ====

Minor, Supernatural The character may adopt one or more flawless disguises, changing both his physical appearance and mannerisms. Choosing this Virtue confers the Supernatural Ability Persona 1.

<span id="performance-abilities"></span>
=== Performance Abilities ===

Of the Abilities listed in this book, the following qualify for Performance Magic (although not all are particularly effective, and some may be hard to use effectively):

PHYSICAL: Athletics, Brawl, Chirurgy, Hunt, Legerdemain, Ride, Stealth, Swim, Bows, Great Weapon, Single Weapon, Thrown Weapon

VERBAL: Bargain, Charm, Guile, Intrigue, Leadership, Teaching

VERBAL AND PHYSICAL: Animal Handling, Carouse, Music

Variable: Craft (Type), Profession (Type)

While Brawl and Martial Abilities may be used in Performance Magic, the magus needs to perform semi-ritualistic movements to cast spells, responding to the needs of the spell, not to the actions of an opponent. If the magus is in combat, then he may only use Performance Magic (Brawl or Martial Abilities) if the player rolls a stress die with three extra botch dice, and treats all nonbotches as die rolls of zero (This represents ignoring the opponent and casting the spell.)

<span id="sorcerous-music-performance-magic"></span>
== Sorcerous Music (Performance Magic) ==

Performance Magic (Music) is often known as Sorcerous Music.

Music is unusual among Performance Magic Abilities — perhaps because instrumental music is similar to the human voice — in that playing a tune on an instrument can freely replace either or both of gestures and words. The magus needs to play an instrument in order to replace gestures, but has a free choice as to whether he sings or plays a tune to replace mystical words. Indeed, wind instruments require that he play a tune to replace words, as he cannot sing while playing a whistle!

Sorcerous Music can be performed as singing-only and not replace gestures (with normal spellcasting penalties or the benefits of Subtle Magic), or can be performed without singing (if the magus plays an instrumental tune), but cannot be performed silently.

When using Voice Range with Sorcerous Music, the spell carries as far as the music (song or instrument) could be heard. For some loud instruments, this may be a long way.

<span id="recognizing-performance-magic"></span>
== Recognizing Performance Magic ==

Most people do not recognize performing an Ability as spellcasting, so the performer may act more openly than most magi, even other Hermetic magi do not automatically recognize his actions.

If a Hermetic magus contemplates Fast Casting to oppose a spell and the caster is using Hermetic words and gestures, a magus may determine the Form automatically (page 217). In other circumstances, the magus must work the Form out.

DETERMINING THE FORM OF A MAGICAL EFFECT:

Stress Die + Perception + Awareness vs. 15 – effect magnitude

If the spell is being cast with mundane words or gestures, the Ease Factor is adjusted as follows:

-3 if Hermetic words are spoken (and can be heard)

+0 if Hermetic gestures are made (and seen)

+3 if both words and gestures are mundane

<span id="personal-power"></span>
==== Personal Power ====

Minor, Supernatural The character has a supernatural power that he can activate at will. This is a single power, equivalent to a Formulaic Hermetic spell with a level of 25 or lower. The power has an Initiative equal to the character's Quickness – (power magnitude/2). It costs one Fatigue level to activate if its level is less than or equal to 50, and two Fatigue levels if its level is 51 to 100. You may also spend levels one-for-one to give the power Penetration; otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero.

The effect must meet at least one of the following criteria:

The effect must be Range: Personal,

<span id="the-effect-must-be-constant"></span>
==== The effect must be constant ====

This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the levels added together to create several powers. For example, a character who took the Virtue twice could have a power with a level of 30 and a Penetration of 0, and a second power with a level and Penetration of 10 each. Note that many powers with a Personal Range do not need a Penetration score, as they do not need to Penetrate the caster's Magic Resistance (if any), and cannot

affect any other target. If the character is likely to want to affect creatures with Magic Resistance while under the effect of the Personal Power, then Penetration may be valuable (see the Hermetic Magic chapter for further details on the functioning of Penetration).

This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, or Hedge Magic Revised Edition, you may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character.

<span id="potent-spells"></span>
=== Potent Spells ===

A Potent spell has a bonus known as its Potency, which is arrived at by combining one or more Casting Items into the design of the spell. Casting Items use the factors given in the Shape and Material Bonus table (page 282): each Casting Item provides one bonus. (If more than one bonus is possible, the spell design states which one is used.)

POTENCY SCORE Sum of Bonus from each Casting Item

POTENCY BONUS: Add Potency to Casting Score

Potency is part of the spell design; a Lab Text for a Potent spell includes the specified Casting Items and Potency Score. A magus teaching a Potent spell teaches the formula he knows, including the Casting Items and Potency Score. The level, for the purposes of inventing it as well as for casting, of a Potent spell is unaltered by the Potency Score. However, a magus may not invent a Potent spell with a Potency higher than his Magic Theory score, even with the aid of a Lab Text or teacher.

Any magus can learn a Potent spell from a Lab Text or teacher, and apply Potency to his Casting Score; the Potent Magic Virtue is required to design a Potent spell from scratch, but not to reproduce one from a Lab Text.

To cast a Potent spell, the caster must touch the specified Casting Items. The items need not be large; they may be small and symbolic (for example, a shield-shaped brooch is still symbolically a shield). If the caster does not have the Casting Items available, the spell cannot be cast at all.

For example, a wand provides several bonuses including +2 &quot;repel things&quot; and +4 &quot;control things at a distance.&quot; A Potent version of Disguise of the Putrid Aroma could use either

bonus in its Potency. Combining it with magnetite (+3 Animal) allows a design with either Potency 5 (requires Magic Theory 5) or Potency 7 (requires Magic Theory 7). The caster must hold a wand and piece of magnetite (or a wand set with magnetite) to add the Potency to his Casting Score.

Potency applies only to Formulaic spells — Spontaneous Magic allows Ceremonial Casting to produce similar results, and enchanted devices use Shape and Material Bonuses during enchantment.

<span id="potent-magic-and-potent-spells"></span>
== Potent Magic and Potent Spells ==

A magus with Potent Magic may create new Potent spells or alter Potent spells to vary the Casting Items.

When inventing a spell within the field of his Potent Magic (including from a Lab Text), the magus simply chooses Casting Items for the design, and then invents the spell as normal. Each chosen Casting Item (up to the limit of Magic Theory) adds a single Shape or Material Bonus to Potency; if more than one bonus might apply to the spell, choose one and note it in the design. The total Potency may not exceed the magus's Magic Theory.

A Lab Text written for this spell includes the Casting Items and Potency, and is usable by any other magus.

In addition, a magus who knows a spell within the field of his Potent Magic may invent a variant spell with different Casting Items (including a variant with no Casting Items). If the only difference is a change in Casting Items, he may invent the variant as if in possession of a Lab Text. If, for any reason, his current Lab Total is lower than the level of the spell, he may still invent the variant in a single season.

you do, remember that the levels of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the number of levels of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)

<span id="personal-vis-source"></span>
==== Personal Vis Source ====

Minor, Hermetic

You have exclusive access to a supply of raw vis. Determine the amount and type with the help of your troupe, the yield should be about one tenth as much as the player covenant expects to gather per year at the beginning of the saga. The yield of your source does not normally change over the course of time, even if the covenant uncovers new sources.

<span id="physician-of-salerno"></span>
==== Physician of Salerno ====

Minor, General The character has attended the famed School of Salerno, the pre-eminent source of medical learning. Not only does he carry the reputation of the school with him (granting a Reputation of Physician of Salerno 2), but he has also learned some unique medical procedures such as the preparation of anesthetics. This Virtue grants an additional 50 experience points to spend on Medicine, Philosophiae, and medical formulae (if you are using the rules in Art and Academe, Chapter Five). To take this Virtue, you must be able to take Academic Abilities.

<span id="piercing-gaze"></span>
==== Piercing Gaze ====

Minor, General By staring intently at people you make them feel uneasy, as if you are peering into their souls. Those with ulterior motives, uneasy consciences, or lying tongues must make rolls against an appropriate Personality Trait, Guile, or whatever the storyguide deems appropriate, to remain calm. Furthermore, you gain a +3 to rolls involving intimidation. Faeries and demons are unfazed by your power.

<span id="potent-magic"></span>
==== Potent Magic ====

Minor or Major, Hermetic The maga's magic is particularly attuned to a narrow field, much as in a Magical Focus. The benefits of Potent Magic are compatible with a Magical Focus, unlike a Magical Focus, unlike a Magical Focus, a maga may have more than one area of Potent Magic, although only one Potent Magic Virtue applies to any single activity.

Potent Magic provides the maga with a bonus in her field of magic, and permits her to devise Potent spells that gain a casting bonus from the sympathetic magic in shapes and materials. Potent Magic can be taught as an alternative to a Magical Focus.

Minor Potent Magic covers the same narrow fields as a Minor Magical Focus, and grants a +3 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score.

Major Potent Magic covers the same wide fields as a Major Magical Focus, and grants a +6 bonus to Lab Totals and Casting Score.

A maga with Potent Magic may also invent new Potent spells within the field of her Potent Magic, and may vary spells she knows.

<span id="powerful-relic"></span>
==== Powerful Relic ====

Major, General You own an unusually powerful relic with a True Faith score of 3. The relic also has one power, which should be agreed upon with the storyguide (see Relics, page 419). As with the Minor General Virtue Relic, the item may be built into any other item that you possess, like a sword or a pendant.

Owning such a powerful relic is a great responsibility, and your character should behave in an appropriate manner. If you ever behave impiously (as judged by the storyguide) your relic will cease to function until suitable penance is made.

<span id="premonitions"></span>
==== Premonitions ====

Minor, Supernatural You intuitively sense whenever something is wrong, or is likely to go wrong soon. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Premonitions 1 (page 170).

<span id="prestigious-student"></span>
==== Prestigious Student ====

General, Minor The character is a son of a nobleman or a prosperous merchant, matriculated in a university that specializes in either Civil Law or Medicine. He has a small group of retainers with him, two or three servants who attend to his needs while at the university. He was trained in Artes Liberales and Latin by a private tutor, and may purchase Academic Abilities at character generation. The character must take a Social Status Virtue to reflect where he is in the educational process.

<span id="priest"></span>
==== Priest ====

Minor, Social Status You have been ordained a priest, which means that you can carry out the sacraments of the Mass, Penance, and Extreme Unction. By your words, you can cause the Son of God to manifest in

bread and wine. As a priest you come under the protection of canon law, meaning that you cannot be prosecuted by secular authorities. You are accorded considerable respect due to your position, and few people are willing to insult you.

You may be a parish priest. If you are, you cannot take the Poor Flaw. Your normal duties involve hearing confession, preaching to your flock, and ministering to their spiritual needs. If you are Wealthy, your parish is rich enough to pay for a curate to do some of the work for you, and you may be a pluralist, holding the benefices of several parishes. Reform-minded churchmen do not approve of pluralism.

If you are not a parish priest, the Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. You may be employed as a curate to a parish priest, or a chaplain to a wealthy individual, or in any other capacity requiring education.

You may purchase Academic Abilities during character generation. If you are a priest in the western Church, under the Pope in Rome, you would normally take the Minor Personality Flaw Vow (see page 150) as one of your normal Flaws. for your vow of celibacy. Priests in the eastern Church, under the Patriarchs in Constantinople and elsewhere, need not be celibate. This Virtue is only available to male characters, and is compatible with the Magister in Artibus Major Virtue, and with some other Virtues, as noted in their descriptions.

<span id="privileged-upbringing"></span>
==== Privileged Upbringing ====

Minor, General You grew up in an environment where you had access to teachers and free time for study. You have an additional 50 experience points, which may be spent on General, Academic, or Martial Abilities. You may not, however, buy Academic or Martial Abilities with your normal pool of\nexperience points unless you have another Virtue or Flaw permitting that. The most common reason for this Virtue is that your family was wealthy while you were a

child, but if you are wealthy now, you should take the Wealthy Virtue (page 115).

<span id="protection"></span>
==== Protection ====

Minor, General You are under the aegis of a powerful person, usually a noble or high-ranking Church official (though other options are possible, if the storyguide approves). Those who know of your favored status treat you carefully, those who do not often pay the price. You have a Reputation (good or bad, your choice) of level 3, which could be higher if your protector is particularly great or well-known.

<span id="puissant-ability"></span>
==== '''Puissant Ability''' ====

Minor, General You are particularly adept with one Ability, and add 2 to its value whenever you use it. Note that you do not, in general, use an Ability when learning it, writing about it, or helping someone else to improve it. You may only take this Virtue once for a given Ability, but may take it more than once for different Abilities.

<span id="puissant-art"></span>
==== Puissant Art ====

Minor, Hermetic You add 3 to the value of one Art whenever you use it. This means all totals in which the score of the Art is part of the total. It does not apply when learning, teaching, or writing about the Art. You may take this Virtue twice, for two different Arts. If a spell has requisites, include the bonus from Puissant Art with that Art when calculating which Art is higher. If the Puissant Art\nis higher, the bonus does not apply to the requisite.

<span id="quiet-magic"></span>
==== Quiet Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

You can cast spells using only a soft voice at no penalty, and at only a –5 penalty if you do not speak at all. You gain no benefits from using your voice normally but gain the normal benefit for using a booming voice. The range of Voice Range spells is determined normally, based on how loud your voice is.

You may take this Virtue twice, and eliminate the penalty altogether.

<span id="rabbi"></span>
==== Rabbi ====

Minor, Social Status Your character is an ordained Rabbi, a teacher and wise man of the Jewish community. He is afforded the respect due from all within his community, who look to him for leadership and guidance. As a rabbi, your character is expected to teach students, to study and write\nupon the law, and to pass judgment upon cases brought before the Jewish court.

The rabbi must take the Educated (Hebrew) Virtue to provide the required Academic Abilities. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

<span id="rapid-convalescence"></span>
==== Rapid Convalescence ====

Minor, General Your body can heal quickly. You get a +3 bonus on all rolls to recover from wounds.

<span id="rat-up-a-drainpipe"></span>
==== Rat Up a Drainpipe ====

Minor, General Using a mixture of acrobatics, climbing and dodging, this character can run through urban areas as if unobstructed. This gives a substantial advantage in opposed Athletics rolls which represent being chased.

<span id="redcap"></span>
==== Redcap ====

Major, Social Status Although you do not have The Gift and cannot work Hermetic magic, you are a full member of the Order of Hermes and of House Mercere (see page 15). There are Gifted members of House Mercere, but they do not take this Virtue, taking the Hermetic Magus Social Status (page 85) instead.

You deliver messages for the Order, and you possess a number of enchanted devices to help you do this. A newly-Gauntleted Redcap has enchanted devices with fifty levels of effect, including modifications to the level due to factors such as the number of uses per day (see the Laboratory chapter, page 256, for details).

These levels are invariably split between two or more effects useful for delivering messages. New Redcaps are never given items capable of killing wounding, or ensorcelling large numbers of mundanes; the risk of abuse bringing trouble on the Order is too great. These will be upgraded and replaced in return for good service, on average an extra two levels per year. You are trained in a similar manner to magi, and may take Academic, Arcane, and Martial Abilities during character generation. You have spent fifteen years as an apprentice, and gained a total of 300 experience points in those fifteen years. (See Detailed Character Creation, page 43.) In addition, you have the Well-Traveled Virtue (page 116) at no cost. When you start to age, a magus with a Lab Total of at least fifty will devise a Longevity Ritual (see page 261) for you free of charge, if you wish. If you make suitable contacts in the course of the saga, this ritual may be devised by a more powerful magus. Redcaps created some years past Gauntlet get improved enchanted devices, as described above, and, if applicable, a Longevity Ritual.

You are supported by your covenant, so you cannot take the Wealthy Virtue or Poor Flaw. You may not take The Gift. You must spend two seasons per year delivering messages for the Order. Your other two seasons are, however, genuinely free, and you may do whatever you wish. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.

<span id="relic"></span>
==== Relic ====

Minor, General You own a holy relic, such as the finger bone of a saint, with a True Faith Score of one. This can be built into any other item you possess (a sword, for\ninstance). The relic does not possess any additional powers. See Chapter 12: Realms for rules for relics and True Faith.

<span id="religious"></span>
==== Religious ====

Minor, Social Status The character is a monk, a nun, a beguine, an anchoress or anchorite, a holy hermit, or similar. You may take Academic Abilities for the character during character generation. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw are unlikely to be appropriate.

Note that for a friar character you should take the Mendicant Friar Virtue instead. Monks ordained as priests should instead take the Priest Social Status. Senior monks and nuns should instead have the Senior Clergy Social Status.

<span id="reserves-of-strength"></span>
==== Reserves of Strength ====

Minor, General

Once per day, when in need, you can perform an incredible feat of strength. For the duration of the action, add +3 to your effective Strength score.

Afterwards, though, you must make two Fatigue rolls.

<span id="ripper"></span>
==== Ripper ====

Minor, Supernatural A ripper has two powers. He can destroy a single piece of cloth, or disembowel a single animal, by spending a Fatigue level, at Sight range, without words or gestures. These are a PeAn(He) 25 and a PeAn 45 effect, each with +0 Penetration. Note that this description is deliberately limiting: a ripper can't break a horse's leg or send it blind. A ripper cannot sever a rope. A ripper cannot cleanly slice things with his mind. The ripper has two, entirely inflexible, effects.

<span id="ritual-power"></span>
==== Ritual Power ====

Major, Supernatural The character has a supernatural power that he can activate at will. This is a single power,\nequivalent to a Ritual Hermetic spell with a level of 25 or lower. The power has an Initiative\nequal to the character's Quickness – (twice power magnitude). It costs one Fatigue level to activate if its level is less than or equal to 25, two Fatigue levels if its level is 26 to 50, and so on. In addition, you must

spend one Confidence Point for every magnitude of the effect. You may also spend levels onefor-one to give the power Penetration, otherwise, it has a Penetration of zero.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, and the levels added together to create several powers or a single stronger power.

This Virtue may be associated with any supernatural realm. If you have access to other books, such as Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, Realms of Power: The Infernal, Realms of Power: Faerie, or Hedge Magic Revised Edition, you may want to base the power on a different system of supernatural powers, to get something more appropriate to the character. If you do, remember that the levels of effects may work on different scales for different systems, and you may want to change the number of levels of effect. The power must be associated with the same supernatural realm as the system on which it is based. (If you have access to other books, you may want to restrict powers based on Hermetic magic to the Magic realm.)

<span id="rosh-beth-din"></span>
==== Rosh Beth Din ====

Major, Social Status The Rosh Beth Din, or Head of

the Court, presides at the Beth Din rabbinic court. Your

<span id="schooled-in-crime"></span>
==== Schooled in Crime ====

Minor, General

The character has been trained extensively in the criminal arts, and has 50 additional experience to spend on Abilities related to thievery.

==== Second Sight ====

Minor, Supernatural You are able to see through\nillusionary concealment and disguise, including invisibility, and can also see naturally\ninvisible things such as spirits and the boundaries between regio levels (see page 421). Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Second Sight 1 (page 170).

<span id="secondary-insight"></span>
==== Secondary Insight ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your method of magical study is especially versatile. When you spend a season studying one of the magical Techniques from a book, a teacher, or raw vis, you also gain a single experience point in any 4 Forms of your choosing. When studying one of the magical Forms, you also gain a single experience point in any 2 separate Techniques of your choosing. You may not put more than one bonus experience point into a single Art, and may

choose different Arts to receive the bonus experience points in each season, even when continuing to study the same Art from the same source. These bonus experience points are not increased by Affinities or any other factors.

<span id="see-in-darkness"></span>
==== See in Darkness ====

Minor, General You have firm confidence in your own abilities, and have a Confidence Score of two. You also start with five Confidence Points, rather than the usual three. (See page 52 for Confidence rules.)

<span id="senior-bard"></span>
==== Senior Bard ====

Minor, Social Status The character has spent five or six years at a bardic school, and is ranked a Cano or Cli respectively. The character has a Local Reputation of 2 representing his fame as a storyteller.

The character has a minimum age of 22, and you can spend experience points on any Realm Lore at character creation even if otherwise unable to take Arcane Abilities.

This Social Status is only available in Hibernia.

<span id="senior-clergy"></span>
==== Senior Clergy ====

Major, Social Status The character is an archbishop, bishop, abbot, abbess, or other senior member of the Church. He has access to the resources of the Church and may have additional duties and powers according to his office.

You may make take either the Wealthy or Poor Virtue/Flaw for the character. This does not necessarily represent the status of the character's diocese instead it represents the personal wealth of the character. Senior clergy can amass wealth by receiving the benefice of several offices. Indeed, it is not unusual for a character to receive the benefice from various parishes scattered throughout Mythic Europe. He may never even visit some of the dioceses in which his parishes are located. although obviously the character needs to employ a curate to discharge the actual priestly duties in these remote parishes.

The character has a Reputation of level 4, either good or bad, in both the local community and the Church.

You may purchase Academic Abilities for the character during character generation.

Senior clergy are subject to canon law, and must be celibate and tonsured (if male). Note whether the character has been ordained as a deacon, priest, bishop, etc. Abbess is the only common position available to women with this Virtue, and even such women are not ordained. The Paid Rights Virtue does not enable women to take any of the other positions.

<span id="senior-master"></span>

Ability Sense Holiness and Unholiness 1 (page 170).

<span id="sense-passions"></span>
==== Sense Passions ====

Major, Supernatural The character can see into the hearts and minds of others, learning their weaknesses, fears, and evil thoughts. This gives her the Supernatural Ability Sense Passions at 1 (page 170).

The shadchan will ensure a match of backgrounds, wealth, education, and character. They are able to do this by forging relationships with all the families in the community, and because of this the shadchan should be both honest and a good judge of character.

The shadchan receives an extra 50 experience points to be spent on social Abilities and an Area Lore appropriate for their community.

<span id="shamash"></span>
==== Shamash ====

Free, Social Status The shamash is the servant of the synagogue and responsible for its well-being.

<span id="shapeshifter"></span>
==== Shapeshifter ====

<span id="sharp-ears"></span>
==== Sharp Ears ====

Minor, General You hear better than most. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls involving hearing.

<span id="side-effect"></span>
==== Side Effect ====

Minor, Hermetic Your magic has some incidental feature that is generally useful, though occasionally annoying. The intensity of the side effect\nincreases with the level of the spell. Examples include a commanding presence when casting that translates into a temporary +1 Presence bonus for a short time after casting, or a calm state of mind derived from casting which allows a bonus on Concentration rolls

for a short time after casting.

<span id="simple-student"></span>
==== Simple Student ====

Minor, Social Status The character is a university student who is has not yet taken a degree. He is typically between 14 and 16 years old and somewhere along his university program.

Minor, General

The character can hide one item on his person, and attempts to find it suffer a –9 penalty on Awareness rolls. The item cannot be larger than a dagger, and the character may swap which items are hidden with a few minutes of work. Wealthy characters often procure collapsible tools to use in conjunction with this Virtue.

<span id="skinchanger"></span>
==== Skinchanger ====

Minor, Supernatural You have a magical cloak, animal skin or similar item made from an animal. While in physical contact with it, you may transform into the form of the animal represented by the item. The transformation takes one full round, and you retain both intelligence and sentience while in animal form. Clothing and possessions (save the animal item) do not transform, and you may be seen as a transformed human with InAn or InCo, or similar spells. If the item is stolen, the new owner has an Arcane Connection to you, and you may not transform until the item is retrieved. If the item is destroyed, you can make a new one over the course of a season, although the method varies depending on what the item is. Skinchangers may transform into any non-magical animal between Size -10 (robin) and Size +2(bear). The character has the normal physical characteristics of the animal, except that +3 is added to the character's Soak score (in animal form only).

<span id="skinchanger-dove"></span>

years of travel and socializing. Almost everywhere you go, you meet someone you know, or can get in touch with someone who can help you.

The storyguide may modify this target number upward for very small areas or areas where it is extremely unlikely that you would know someone. You may purchase this Virtue more than once, each time specifying a different social group.

<span id="sofer"></span>
==== Sofer ====

Free, Social Status The sofer is the scribe whose role it is to create a new Sefer Torah, or repair any fading or damage to an existing scroll, as required. The sofer must be educated and able to read and write Hebrew as the act of scribing the Sefer Torah requires knowledge and understanding of the text.

As a sofer, the character must have the Educated (Hebrew) Virtue.

<span id="special-circumstances"></span>
==== Special Circumstances ====

Minor, Hermetic You are able to perform magic better in certain uncommon situations (such as during a storm or while touching the target), gaining a +3 bonus to your Casting Scores and Magic Resistance. (A character only gains a bonus to Magic Resistance if she has Magic Resistance from another source.) You may take this Virtue more than once, but you only gain a +3 bonus even if more than one set of circumstances applies.

<span id="spell-improvisation"></span>
==== Spell Improvisation ====

Minor, Hermetic

The magus may add the magnitude of a Formulaic spell he knows as a bonus to his Casting Total when Spontaneously casting a spell that is similar to it (see Similar Spells, page 260). This includes fast-casting a spell that is the same as or very similar to one of his Formulaic spells, though he does not get this bonus if he has the Fast Cast Ability for a

mastered spell, since in that case you add his Mastery Ability instead. This bonus does not stack with other bonuses to his Casting Total, nor does it stack with itself if the magus happens to know several similar spells.

<span id="spirit-votary-1"></span>
==== Spirit Votary ====

Free, Mythic Companion Taking this Virtue at character creation makes the character a Spirit Votary, a kind of Mythic Companion (page 63). This Virtue grants the Second Sight Virtue for free, and allows the character to have two points of Virtues for every point of Flaw.

<span id="spiritual-pact"></span>
==== Spiritual Pact ====

Major, Supernatural

The character has made a pact or agreement with a powerful Magical spirit, and in return for loyal service, is granted access to that spirit's power. The pact serves as an Arcane Connection to the character of indefinite duration, which the spirit can use to make itself aware of the current location and state of health of its servant.

The character can channel the power of the spirit by spending a Confidence Point. Make a Presence + Magic Lore + stress die roll: this is the amount of Magic Might Pool that the character acquires from his spiritual master. The Might points acquired are always less than the current Might points of the spirit, regardless of the roll's result. On a botch, the character loses all current Confidence points. This action is equivalent to spellcasting with regard to the concentration it requires. The character can spend these Might points on any of the spirit's powers. Penetration is calculated in the usual way for magical creatures using the initial Might Pool in place of Magic Might, and including the character's Penetration Ability, if any.

The character using this power does not have a Might score, just a Might pool. He does not gain Magic Resistance from the use of this power, nor does he leave behind vis if he is slain. He cannot be affected by Vim spells (or similar magics)

that target the Might score of supernatural creatures. Without a Might score, the pool does not replenish; once the character has spent all of his Might points this power ends. All powers used have their duration lapse when the character uses his last point of Might Pool. If this power is evoked again while the character still possesses Might Pool, then the new points gained replace the points left over; the two pools do not add. The points acquired by the character are lost from the spirit's Might pool and cannot be returned by the character, but the spirit regenerates the spent points

While the connection to the spirit is active, there is some visual manifestation of this, which makes it clear that some supernatural effect is taking place. For example, if contacting a fertility spirit, fruits and grains might spring from around the character's footsteps. While in contact with a war spirit, a character might appear to be clothed in ghostly armor. When the character is actively channeling the spirit, he acts as an Arcane Connection to the spirit of indefinite duration, although this connection lapses when the Might Pool is exhausted.

The storyguide should decide upon the powers of the spirit. With the agreement of the troupe, this Virtue could be used to channel the power from a spirit of a different Supernatural Realm; or from a group of closely related spirits, such as a small pantheon of pagan &quot;gods,&quot; but care should be taken not to grant the character too much flexibility with this one Virtue. A character can only have a single pact.

<span id="strong-angelic-heritage"></span>
==== Strong Angelic Heritage ====

Minor, Supernatural

Your angelic heritage is purer, granting you a Divine Might score and supernatural powers. This Virtue may only be taken if you have the Major Virtue Blood of the Nephilim.

You are a divine being and possess a Divine Might (Corpus) score equal to your age divided by 20, which increases as you grow older. This grants you a Magic Resistance score. You

contain a number of pawns of Corpus vis equal to your Divine Might divided by 10 (rounded down, but always at least one pawn) that can only be extracted if you are dead. You are immune to Warping of any sort, and may not have any supernatural powers that derive from a realm other than the Divine.

You have up to thirty levels of holy powers that may be invoked by spending Might points. Design the powers' effects using the Hermetic spell guidelines (or the guidelines for Holy Powers in Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, from page 46). The Might cost for each power is equal to its magnitude divided by two (rounded down, but always at least one point). The Initiative score of the power is your Quickness.

You may take this Virtue multiple times. Each additional time you take it increases by thirty the number of levels of holy powers you may invoke, but has no other effect; in particular, it does not increase your Divine Might.

<span id="strong-faerie-blood"></span>
==== Strong Faerie Blood ====

Major, Supernatural The blood of the fay is strong in you. Perhaps one of your parents was actually a faerie, or maybe you were conceived or born in a place of great faerie power. This ancestry grants you several abilities.

First, you have natural longevity. You start making aging rolls at the age of fifty, rather than the normal 35, and get –3 to Aging Rolls, cumulative with any other bonuses.

Second, you have faerie eyes. This gives you the Virtue Second Sight (see page 106) at no cost, and you can see normally in total darkness or semi-darkness, such as in deep woods or at night. Your eyes look mostly normal, but are an unusual and vivid color.

Third, you may learn Faerie Lore during character generation.

Finally, you get the benefits of a particular type of fay

heritage, as given in the Virtue Faerie Blood (page 79). Your specific fay heritage is clearly visible. Choose one physical quirk, such as small horns, literally blue blood, or eyes without irises and pupils, appropriate to the faeries from which you are descended.

You may not have both Faerie Blood and Strong Faerie Blood.

This is a Supernatural Virtue, and you cannot lose it when being trained as a magus (see page 64). If your master cannot preserve the ability, you cannot be trained.

<span id="strong-willed"></span>
==== Strong-Willed ====

Minor, General You cannot easily be coerced into activities, beliefs, or feelings. You get +3 on any roll which may require strength of will.

<span id="student-of-realm"></span>
==== Student of (Realm) ====

Minor, General You have been trained in the mystical aspects of one of the four realms of power (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic), and you have a +2 bonus on all uses of the appropriate Lore. You may take that Lore at character generation even if you cannot learn other Arcane Abilities. You may take this Virtue multiple times, for a different realm each time. You may not take Student of (Realm) and Puissant Ability for the same Lore.

<span id="study-bonus"></span>
==== Study Bonus ====

Minor, Hermetic

When given the opportunity to study an Art from books or raw vis in the presence of the Form or Technique, your surroundings give you new insights into your studies. Add two to die rolls to study from vis, or two to the Quality of any text you study from. Your current Art score determines the magnitude of the surroundings you require to get the bonus. See the table for some guidelines.

<span id="subtle-magic"></span>
==== Subtle Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

You may cast spells without using gestures at no penalty. You gain no benefits from using normal gestures but gain the normal benefit for exaggerated gestures.

<span id="sufi"></span>
==== Sufi ====

Minor, Social Status, Supernatural You are a Muslim mystic, seeking a closer union with God through asceticism and rituals. You are a member of a tariga of Sufis led by a shaykh. While the group supports you in times of need, your shaykh expects equal commitment from you to him or her and the other members: you should choose an appropriate Minor Story Flaw, such as Mentor, which does not yield any points for buying Virtues. See Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, page 116, for details of the supernatural powers wielded by some Sufis. It is also possible to be an entirely mundane Sufi, in which case you should take this Virtue as a Social Status Virtue.

Most Muslims treat you with respect for your pious lifestyle. You may purchase the Abilities Theology: Islam, Islamic Law, and Dominion Lore at character creation

This Virtue may be taken by both male and female characters, either as a Minor Social Status Virtue or a Minor Supernatural Virtue.

<span id="summon-animals"></span>
==== '''Summon Animals''' ====

Major, Supernatural You are able to summon animals to your side. This Virtue grants a score of 1 in the Supernatural Ability Summon Animals.

<span id="supernatural-beauty"></span>
==== Supernatural Beauty ====

Major, Supernatural The character possesses that style of mystical beauty that, when threatened, calls royal power, folk magic, and heroism to its defense. A player may use this Virtue, once per story, to ask a storyguide to insert a fortunate coincidence, of the storyguide's choice, into a scene. The troupe may veto the use of the Virtue in any situation where supernatural aid seems profoundly unlikely. Characters with this Virtue are frequently assisted by passing knights of chivalrous inclination, often find magic weapons, and frequently have their jailers, or their jailers' daughters, fall in love with them.

Faeries frequently assist characters with this Virtue. Faeries understand the classic forms of aid that beauty evokes in stories, and so many of the magical steeds and wandering princes the character encounters are actually faeries, watching the story unfold from the inside.

A character lacking a positive Presence score may not have this Virtue.

<span id="tainted-treasure"></span>
==== Tainted Treasure ====

Minor, General, Tainted The character has inherited or acquired a vast amount of treasure, but it is cursed to cause harm. This treasure might come from an ancestor who made a deal with demons, or tricked them out of money. It might have been stolen from one of the secret caches that demons maintain, so that they have wealth nearby to tempt humans. A tainted person who rebels, and swaps the Tragic Life Flaw for the Plagued by Supernatural Entity Flaw, might be tempted to retain some of the valuable props provided for their role. The treasure is sufficient that the character could transform it into a source of the Wealthy Virtue. As examples, the character could buy a ship and become a trader, or buy land in a city and become a landlord.

The difficulty is that the wealth is cursed, so it lacks the natural increase in bounty that is a gift from God. If traded for other items of value, the curse moves to these items. Any venture into which it is invested will, eventually, fail. Any building it is used to purchase will, eventually, burn down. If it is used for a non-sinful purpose, the treasure destroys itself: gold given to charity turns to sand, ships used to ferry supplies to the starving steer themselves onto rocks.

The wealth may be used to purchase the services of people, who, because they have souls, choose their own fates. The limitation that the wealth only allows itself to be spent sinfully remains, however, so it is likely to be given to amoral, covetous, envious, dangerous people.

<span id="the-knights-templar"></span>
== The Knights Templar ==

The Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, the Knights Templar, are an extremely important and influential order in Mythic Europe. Women cannot pay a fine, with the Paid Rights Virtue, to take a role in the order that is restricted to men. For full details, see Chapter 7 of ''The Church''.

<span id="templar-administrator"></span>
==== Templar Administrator ====

Minor, Social Status The character is technically a brother-knight or brothersergeant for the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, but is really an administrator for the order's many holdings and activities. While he has sworn the Templar oath and vows, and lives a monastic life, his many duties mean he is likely to never see active combat. He is answerable only to his superiors in the order and to the pope. He may have considerable influence and access to enormous resources, but no additional time. You may take Academic Abilities during character creation. This Virtue can replace the Brother-Knight, Brother-Sergeant, and Brother-Priest Status Virtues. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

<span id="templar-commander"></span>
==== Templar Commander ====

Major, Social Status The character is a commander within the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon and has authority over all aspects of the order in a province or preceptory. This Virtue also grants the Temporal Influence Minor Virtue, as the character has the ear of any important nobles or clergymen in the area. He also has access to the considerable wealth of the Templars, including any funds, lands, and resources. although he has no extra time. He may levy taxes and tithes over the lands he controls as if he were a landed noble or bishop, and charge service fees on monies he lends, and he may even act as a

judge for minor lay crimes committed on his lands. Because of his high position, he is a wellknown figure and has a Reputation of level 3 in his area. He is expected to support the order's crusading efforts if he is in the West, and if he lives in the East he is expected to participate directly. Should the grand master die and the character lives in the East, he has the right to participate in choosing a new grand master. This Virtue includes the effects of the Brother-Knight Virtue, and likewise can only be taken by male characters.

<span id="templar-confrere-or-consoeur-free-social-status"></span>
==== Templar Confrere or Consoeur Free, Social Status ====

The character is an associate member of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, and has taken one or two of the Templar vows. His membership is generally temporary (although it need not be), and he may possess other Social Status Virtues or Flaws to reflect his true station, such as Clerk, Knight, Landed Noble, Peasant, or even

the order — knights and nobles receive more respect than commoners. Women may also become associate members (consoeurs), although they are housed separately from the men. Associates are governed by the same rule as full members, although they have fewer rights. Some associates may hold important positions within a particular Templar commandery, especially if they possess a valuable skill.

<span id="templar-office-holder"></span>
==== Templar Office Holder ====

Minor, Social Status The character holds a position within the local hierarchy of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, such as the deputy commander, marshal, or infirmarer. He may give orders to brothers in his region, is accorded the considerable respect due to his position, and has the power to enforce the rule and its various

laws, although he answers to the

local commander. Because of his

high position, he is a well-known figure and has a Reputation of level 2 in his region. You may take this Virtue with any of the Templar Status Virtues, as your character may be a senior brothersergeant or senior Templar chaplain. This Virtue is compatible with the Temporal Influence Minor Virtue. If you take this virtue with the Templar Commander Major Virtue, then your character holds one of the few exalted ranks within the Templars, such as grand commander or grand marshal, or a rank that has authority over the Eastern or Western region of the order, in which case you likely reside in Acre, Paris, or London.

<span id="templar-prestige"></span>
==== Templar Prestige ====

Minor, General

A member of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, the character enjoys great respect and admiration among his fellow brothers. This may be because of a great act of heroism or piety, or because of the rank or station he possessed before he joined the order. He starts with a

Reputation of level 4 within the Templars.

<span id="templar-servant"></span>
==== Templar Servant ====

Free, Social Status The character is a servant working at a commandery of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon. He is supported by the Templars, and probably lives in the commandery itself or close by. He also receives payment as befits his profession. As a servant of the Templars, he is covered by the papal bull exempting him from secular and lay authority, and is generally accorded some respect by non-Templars.

<span id="templar-specialist"></span>
==== Templar Specialist ====

Minor, Social Status The character works as a skilled employee of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon, filling a crucial role for which the Templars have no full or associate member, such as craftsmen, blacksmiths, artisans, notaries, squires, soldiers, scribes, or translators. You may take one restricted group of Abilities during character creation, such as Academic or Martial Abilities. As a servant of the Templars, the character is covered by the papal bull exempting him from secular and lay authority, and is generally accorded some respect. This Virtue may be taken by Muslim characters, who will typically act as translators (and who should also take the Outsider Flaw or similar).

<span id="temporal-influence"></span>
==== Temporal Influence ====

Minor, General Through blood or a position of trust, you enjoy some political weight in society. You have the ear of a leader and may yourself lead common folk at times, if they respect your position. The more influence you have, the more responsibility, and the harder it is to work unopposed with magi. Grogs may not take this Virtue.

<span id="tethered-magic"></span>
==== Tethered Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic You can pass control of your non-Ritual spells to others, just as if they were the caster, &quot;tethering&quot; the magic to them for the spell's duration. You may

also tether a spell to an object, which can then transfer the spell to an appropriate target when it comes into range. This can even be done whenever you activate an effect in a magic item. However, a side effect of this sort of magic is that all of your spells and the effects of any magic items you activate are Arcane Connections to you.

<span id="tough"></span>
==== Tough ====

Minor, General You can take physical punishment better than most people. You get a +3 bonus on your Soak score.

<span id="town-magistrate"></span>
==== Town Magistrate ====

Minor, Social Status The character has a position of judicial responsibility in a town, with a small staff of minor officials (up to five individuals). The character must be a citizen of the town, have a score of at least 3 in the Civil and Canon Law (or Common Law) Ability, and is paid a wage or gains special privileges in return for his services. Being a magistrate occupies the character for two seasons each year, but he is free for the remaining two seasons. Academic Abilities may be bought for the character, during character generation.

<span id="trained-assassin"></span>
==== Trained Assassin ====

Minor, General This Virtue is only available to characters with one of the Social Status Virtues of the Nizaris. He has completed several missions on behalf of his masters, giving him 50 additional experience points that may be spent on any Martial Abilities as well as Athletics, Guile, or Stealth.

<span id="troubadourtrobairitz"></span>
==== Troubadour/Trobairitz ====

Minor, Social Status Troubadours are wandering minstrels and poets (&quot;trobairitz&quot;\nis the feminine form). The tradition originated in southern France (see Faith and Flame, page 12), but has spread across much of western Europe.

You are not tied to any community and survive by

performing, entertaining, or doing other casual work. You may take Academic skills during character creation and should have a reputation regarding the sort of material you produce and your adherence to the tenets of courtly love. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally, although if you are wealthy, you are supported by someone. Your supporter does not question your activities in any way, however.

Troubadour characters often possess Virtues such as Famous, Free Expression, Inspirational, Puissant Performance, Social Contacts, True Love, and Well-Traveled.

<span id="troupe-upbringing"></span>
==== Troupe Upbringing ====

Minor, General You were raised among a group of entertainers, spending much of your childhood traveling from town to town. Rolls involving Abilities in a selected area (which you should have approved by the storyguide) receive a +2 modifier. Examples might include tumbling and acrobatics, knife throwing and juggling, or storytelling and acting.

<span id="true-faith"></span>
==== True Faith ====

Major, General Through piety and holy devotion you have faith that can move mountains. You have a True Faith score of 1 and can gain more. For more about True Faith, see page 419.

<span id="true-love-pc"></span>
==== True Love (PC) ====

Minor, General You have found the one person meant for you in all of creation. and the bond between the two of you cannot be sundered. Whenever you are suffering, in danger, or dejected, the thought of your love gives you strength to persevere. Thus, you may add +3 to appropriate Personality Trait rolls, and add additional bonuses as allowed by the storyguide (never in excess of +3) to activities that will return you to your love, or save her life. In dire need, she may even come to rescue you. On the other hand, you are tied to your lover,

to whom you must return frequently. If you do not, you may suffer penalties to most actions requiring spirit due to melancholy. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it. Your True Love is another player character, who must also have this Virtue. True Love is never one-sided.

This Virtue may be renamed 'True Friend' to cover equally close attachments which are not romantic.

<span id="turb-trained"></span>
==== Turb Trained ====

Minor, Social Status This character has grown up at the covenant, been trained to fight in the turb, and picked up a few things from the magi's trusted servants. At character creation, he is allowed to learn Martial Abilities. He may also learn whichever single dead language the magi speak in addition to his local tongue. His fortunes are tied to the turb, and he is thus prohibited from being Wealthy or Poor.

<span id="unaffected-by-the-gift"></span>
==== Unaffected by The Gift ====

Minor, General

The character is not affected by the negative effects of The Gift or Magical Air in others. Even a Blatant Gift does not especially bother the character.

<span id="unaging"></span>
==== Unaging ====

Minor, Supernatural You do not suffer the effects of age. In game terms, your aging points do not decrease your Characteristics, only building up to give you Decrepitude points. If a crisis is not potentially fatal. you suffer no ill-effects. You may die from terminal and potentially fatal crises, according to the normal rules. You are not enfeebled when you reach four Decrepitude points, but you die as normal when you reach five. You may choose your apparent age freely, although if you are basically human it should be less than or equal to your actual age.

<span id="unbound-tongue"></span>
==== '''Unbound Tongue''' ====

Minor, Supernatural Whenever the character is transformed into a non-human form (whether by spell, magic\nitem, curse, or a heartbeast) he may speak any human languages he knows with no impediment. If he is a magus, he may use his voice as normal to cast spells.

<span id="university-grammar-teacher-minor-social-status"></span>
==== University Grammar Teacher Minor, Social Status ====

The character is employed by a university to teach its younger members grammar. The character can be of any age or gender. They may purchase the Academic Abilities: Latin and Artes Liberales at character

generation, and should have a

score in Teaching. They must

teach two seasons out of the year.

<span id="variable-power"></span>
==== Variable Power ====

Minor, Supernatural One of the character's magic powers (Greater, Lesser, Personal, or Ritual) becomes more powerful over time, based on either (age / 10), (Might Score / 5), Warping Score, or his score in an appropriate Ability. (Age and Warping should not be allowed as variables if the character is immune to their effects.) For example, an effect that allows the character to change his shape into an animal might be associated with a special Ability, and his score in that Ability would determine how many different animals he could become.

Generally speaking, a single power can have its effect level increased by five, or include another effect of the same level that is similar the original, for each level of variance. For a character with Variable Powers based on his age, for example, this would mean the effectiveness of one of his powers would be increased by a total of five magnitudes after he has lived for 50 years.

This Virtue may be taken more than once, if the character has more than one power, but it only applies once to a single power.

<span id="venditor"></span>
==== Venditor ====

Major, Social Status The character is a venditor, a selling-agent for a Verditius maga, bartering her goods to other interested mundane parties. He is most likely a minor noble, ousted merchant-guild master, or defrocked cleric. He may select Academic Abilities at character generation. You also receive 50 additional experience points that you can put in Bargain, Charm,

Folk Ken, Guile, Intrigue, or any

<span id="venus-blessing"></span>
==== Venus' Blessing ====

Living Language.

Minor, General People are often attracted to you. You get +3 on Communication and Presence rolls with sexually compatible characters in appropriate situations. At times you can put this to good use. At\nother times it's an annoyance.

<span id="verditius-magic"></span>
==== Verditius Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

You have been initiated into the Outer Mystery of Verditius Magic (see page 240), and thus are a member of House Verditius. Note

that all Verditius magi gain this Virtue for free at character creation.

<span id="ways-of-the-land"></span>
==== Ways Of The (Land) ====

Major, General You have a deep understanding of a type of terrain, feeling more natural and at home there than anywhere else. Examples include Ways of the Forest, Ways of the Mountain, Ways of the Steppe or Ways of the Town. You get a +3 bonus to all rolls, including combat and Casting Scores, that directly involve that area and its inhabitants; mundane, magical, or faerie. In addition, you roll one fewer botch die than normal (which may mean you roll no botch dice) in rolls that pertain to your area of understanding. You are not normally molested by animals of the terrain, and though particularly vicious creatures may still attack you, at least they'll accord you proper respect. (For Ways of the Town, this still applies to town animals, of which there are plenty in the medieval world, rather than people. The +3 bonus does apply to people.) You may choose this Virtue multiple times, for different

<span id="wealthy"></span>
==== Wealthy ====

Major, General You are a rich member of your class. You may spend three seasons per year on study or adventuring, as you can pay people to look after your interests, and these seasons are genuinely free. Exactly how wealthy you are depends on your social class; a noble would have at least a dozen servants, including some bodyguards, while a wealthy townsman would have a good house and maybe three servants. Whatever your class, you are wealthy enough to afford goods generally associated with a higher class. and thus risk being labeled a vulgar social climber. Wealthy characters may live at a covenant, but they are not supported by the covenant. As all Hermetic magi are supported by their covenant, no magi may take this Virtue.

<span id="well-traveled"></span>
==== Well-Traveled ====

Minor, General You have journeyed extensively\nin this part of the world and find it easy to get along with people throughout the area. You have fifty bonus experience points to spend on living languages, Area Lores, and Bargain, Carouse, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, or Guile.

<span id="whistle-up-the-wind"></span>
==== Whistle Up The Wind ====

Major, Supernatural You can create winds by whistling. This Virtue grants a score of 1 in the Supernatural Ability Whistle Up The Wind.

<span id="wilderness-sense"></span>
==== Wilderness Sense ====

Minor, Supernatural You are mystically attuned to the ways of the wilderness. Choosing this Virtue confers the Ability Wilderness Sense 1 (page 172).

<span id="wisdom-from-ignorance"></span>
==== Wisdom from Ignorance ====

Minor, Supernatural One school of Sufis found in Egypt is particularly interested in calligraphy, and the aesthetics of the enigma. By this, they mean that pondering texts which have been structured as meaningful, but which the viewer cannot read, can be used as a form of meditation which brings enlightenment. They are able to use books as sources of training provided they are unable to read the language they are written in.

The sufis use this ability to gain understanding of spiritual matters, so players should create Ability books normally, and when sufis use this Virtue, switch the Ability learned from the book to Theology Organisation Lore: Sufis or similarly uplifting subjects. A sufi using this Virtue may occasionally gain experience in materially practical Abilities, but this only occurs in the context of overcoming specific challenges on spiritual journeys. Directly applicable learning like this is considered a miracle by the sufi, and troupes should police this like any other miracle.

<span id="wise-one"></span>
==== Wise One ====

Minor, Social Status You belong to a broad class that includes mystics, seers, healers, and the like. You are probably magical, and will probably want to purchase a Virtue that gives you some sort of supernatural ability. You are well regarded in the community, although your presence may cause fear as well as awe or respect. If you lack such good standing, though, you are most likely a wanderer or an outcast. You may take either Arcane or Academic Abilities, but not both, at character creation. The Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw affect you normally. This Virtue is available to male and female characters.

<span id="withstand-casting"></span>
==== Withstand Casting ====

Minor, Hermetic

If a magus has this Virtue, then whenever he is about to lose Fatigue from casting a spell, he loses 1 less Fatigue level than normal, with a minimum of 1 Fatigue level — but if the spell would have been cast without Fatigue loss, then he still loses no Fatigue.

A magus may take the Virtue more than once, and withstand 1 Fatigue level for each level of the Virtue, although the minimum Fatigue loss remains. If he has Withstand Casting (3), he may withstand up to 3 Fatigue levels lost, with a minimum of 1 level lost.

The Virtue decreases the severity of the Fatigue lost in the exact manner of the existing Fatigue loss. Thus, if the magus casts a Formulaic spell, the Fatigue is short-term Fatigue, easily recovered, and if he runs out of Fatigue levels he is rendered unconscious, loss of extra Fatigue levels results in him being unconscious for one hour for each overflowing level, and the respite of Withstand Casting lessens this. If, on the other hand, he casts a Ritual spell, then the Fatigue is long-term Fatigue, and losing more Fatigue than he has remaining causes wounds the respite of Withstand Casting reduces the severity of wounds, and this may result in

him taking no wounds (with the minimum Fatigue lost rendering him unconscious).

You may not start your character with both Vulnerable Casting and Withstand Casting. However, she may acquire both in the course of play (Withstand Casting from Initiation rituals or beneficial Twilight effects; Vulnerable Casting from Ordeals or bad Twilight effects). If this occurs, apply the extra loss from Vulnerability first, then withstand the increased loss.

Some Virtues, such as Life Boost and Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic, actually use the magus's life-force to power the spell: the lost Fatigue powers the spell, and without that loss, no power boost is possible. While a magus may choose to apply Withstand Casting to such a spell, if he does then he loses the benefits from withstood levels.

Example: Vita, a maga with Life-Linked Spontaneous Magic, aims to cast a level 20 spell, but falls short and only generates a level 16 result. She will lose 2 Fatigue levels (1 for spontaneous casting, 1 for the shortfall in Life-Linked Magic).

Although she has Vulnerable Casting (1) (from past Twilight experiences) so suffers an extra Fatigue level loss, she also has Withstand Casting (3) (from Initiations), and can use this to withstand the Fatigue lost to the Vulnerable Casting.

She has another 2 levels of Withstand Casting, but if she eliminates the Life-Linked loss, the shell will fail (and she will still suffer any remaining Fatigue loss). She cannot Withstand the base Spontaneous casting Fatigue.

It is, however, useful to have the Withstand Casting Virtue even with Life- Linked Spontaneous Magic, in case that shortfall is extreme; for example, if the magus botches and the Casting Total is reduced to zero.

Example: Some time later, Vita tries again, hoping to cast another level 20 spell. However, she hotches, and her Casting Total is zero. She would normally lose 6 Fatigue levels (1 for spontaneous casting, plus 1 for Vulnerable Casting, plus 4 for the shortfall in Casting Total), but she can withstand 3 Fatigue levels lost, and only suffers a net loss of 3 Fatigue levels. The spell fails, but she is still conscious.

<span id="flaws"></span>
== Flaws ==

<span id="abandoned-apprentice"></span>
==== '''Abandoned Apprentice''' ====

Major, Story The character was abandoned by his master midway through his Hermetic training. He knows Hermetic magic and can cast spells and enchant items like other magi. He is not a member of the Order of Hermes, however.

Some Tribunals rule that an apprentice has a year to find another parens before he is hunted down and slain like a Marched magus. Most Tribunals rule that abandoning an apprentice is a low crime, and if the character makes his situation known his parens may face legal action.

Decide at what age the character was abandoned. Create the character as a regular apprentice up until that age, and then give him experience points based on his age and other Virtues for his life past being abandoned. If the character knows the Parma Magica, he must join the Order or be slain.

Even if the character joins the Order, his background continues to cause problems for him.

<span id="ability-block"></span>
==== '''Ability Block''' ====

Minor, General You are completely unable to learn a certain class of Abilities, for some reason. This may be Martial Abilities, or a more limited set of the others. A profound inability to master logic would rule out Artes Liberales, Philosophiae, any Law, Medicine, and Theology. Alternatively, you might be\nunable to learn any languages\nother than your native tongue. It must be possible for your

character to learn the abilities in question in the absence of this Flaw, but she need have no intention of doing so. You may only take this Flaw once.

<span id="afflicted-tongue"></span>
==== Afflicted Tongue ====

Minor, General

You have a speech impediment, such as a lisp, stutter, or missing teeth. You suffer a –2 penalty to all rolls involving the voice, and all Casting Scores if you cast the spell using words. If you are a magus, you must also roll an extra botch die when casting a spell using words.

<span id="age-quickly"></span>
==== Age Quickly ====

Major, Supernatural Probably due to a curse or a magical disaster, you age twice as fast as normal people. Your effective age (which applies as if it were your actual age when creating a Longevity Ritual, and when making rolls on the aging table) increases two years for every year that passes, and you make two aging rolls each year. It is possible to halt or slow the decline by supernatural means, such as Longevity Rituals, but they must deal with your effective age, not your chronological age.

<span id="ambitious"></span>
==== '''Ambitious''' ====

Major or Minor, Personality You want to be the most\nsuccessful or powerful person in the world in some respect. You will not be distracted into doing things that do not contribute to your ambition, and are very eager to do things that advance it.

<span id="anchored-to-the-land"></span>
==== Anchored to the (Land) ====

Minor, General

The character suffers from feelings of loneliness and depression when she cannot see or hear a particular type of environment. In game terms, the character has a –3 penalty to all rolls when traveling through any other sort of environment (it is assumed that once the character has time to recover from the journey, she will find some reminder of her natural environment to help her rest). For example, a character

who is Anchored to the Sea would suffer the penalty when traveling overland, but once settled can easily comfort herself — with the sound of the sea heard in a seashell, perhaps.

<span id="animal-companion"></span>
==== '''Animal Companion''' ====

Minor, Story

You are accompanied by a loyal, intelligent (but mundane) animal that can obey simple commands. Your relationship with it is very close. If it should die, you would be profoundly upset.

<span id="apostate"></span>
==== '''Apostate''' ====

Minor, General You have converted from one faith to another or from one set of beliefs to another. You have a bad Reputation at 4 among members of your previous faith, and you may receive some slight distrust from your new faith as well, depending upon how sincere your conversion seems.

<span id="arthritis"></span>
==== Arthritis ====

Minor, General Your joints are stiff and often painful, making almost any prolonged movement difficult. You are at –3 to rolls involving repetitive movement, sustained over time. Occasionally, the pain is so great that you are seriously disabled. On any movement or combat botch, one of your joints may &quot;lock up,&quot; making the limb effectively

useless (-6 to all rolls involving

it) until you have a chance to

rest it for a day or two.

<span id="avaricious"></span>
==== Avaricious ====

Major or Minor, Personality You want money, lots of money. When you have it, you do not spend it, but hoard it so that you can count it. You can be avaricious about physical things\nother than money, such as books or raw vis. In this case, you do not use the things you hoard, nor do you allow others to use them.

<span id="baneful-circumstances"></span>
==== Baneful Circumstances ====

Minor, Supernatural Something about the character's supernatural nature weakens him in relatively common circumstances, such as when touching the ground or when in

the presence of women. At these times, the character cannot recover Fatigue, heal wounds, or recover Might, and if at the end of the year the character has spent more than half of his time subject to these conditions, he must make an additional Aging roll even if he is normally immune to aging because of a Longevity Ritual or Might Score.

<span id="beloved-rival"></span>
==== Beloved Rival ====

Minor or Major, Story For a Minor Story Flaw, the character has a rival who is both fiercely protective of him and obsessed with opposing him at every turn. For Tytalan magi, this rival is usually an older maga, most likely the magus's former teacher, or possibly an elder apprentice of the character's master. Much like the Enemies Flaw, the rival periodically causes trouble for the magus; however, she jealously guards the privilege of making the magus's life a misery, and often steps in to remove obstacles that are not of her own making. The rival genuinely believes that her opposition benefits her victim, and desires to see him prosper through adversity.

If the character takes on the role of the beloved rival for another character, then this is a Major Flaw. The character generates stories by causing trouble for their rival, and also has to react when someone else tries to harm them.

Such relationships are a tradition of House Tytalus, and may be mutual. When the rivalry is mutual, the troupe may allow the character to take both the Minor and Major versions of this Flaw. This will mean that the rivalry will be a very important feature of the whole saga, and thus the whole troupe must consider whether they want that.

<span id="bigamist"></span>
==== Bigamist ====

Major, Story The character has two entirely separate lives, in two cities, and moves between the two on some pretext, most likely trade.

Bigamists have two spouses, and maintain two households, which they must pay for. If you are using the rules in ''City and Guild'', the merchant's annual cost of maintaining his business rises by (6 x Wealth Multiplier) Labor Points. Some bigamists mitigate this expense by pretending to be of lower status in their alternate life, which reduces the additional Labor Point cost by half (to 3 x Wealth Multiplier).

<span id="black-sheep"></span>
==== Black Sheep ====

Major, Story You come from a prestigious family, but you have somehow\nestranged yourself from your relatives. They have nothing to do with you, unless they wish to punish you somehow or make\nuse of you. Those who resent your family's power can take safe revenge by assaulting you. You begin the game with a bad Reputation of your choice at level 2, among those who respect your family.

<span id="blackmail"></span>
==== Blackmail ====

Minor, Story You have information that some powerful person would prefer kept hidden. You receive payments or services in return for your silence, and you may occasionally demand special favors. Don't push your luck your victim may decide it isn't worth the cost, or silence you permanently. This benefit has a yearly value of about 50 silver pennies, possibly more if you keep the pressure on. You should detail and record the specifics of this arrangement.

<span id="blatant-gift"></span>
==== Blatant Gift ====

Major, Hermetic People immediately realize that there is something strange about you, even if they do not

about you, even if they do not know you are a magus. Animals are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by your presence. You suffer a –6 penalty on all interaction rolls with normal people and animals, and should see page 203 for further discussion of this Flaw's effects.

<span id="blatant-magical-air"></span>
==== Blatant Magical Air ====

Major, Supernatural Only characters with a Magical Air or The Gift may take this Flaw.

The character is especially disturbing to others, so much that they can barely tolerate its presence. The character suffers a –6 penalty to social actions, and is immediately hated and feared by members of the mundane population. This effect is the same as the Blatant Gift, and a character may not have both Flaws.

<span id="blind"></span>
==== Blind ====

Major, General You have little or no sight. Using missile weapons is futile, reading is impossible, and navigation in unknown territory is difficult to say the least. Blind magi can detect targets by other senses, and thus are less limited than people trying to use missile weapons. However, blind magi cannot aim spells without magical aid.

<span id="bound-casting-tools"></span>
==== '''Bound Casting Tools''' ====

Minor, Hermetic The magus's casting tools, as used by House Verditius, are so personal that they become lasting Arcane Connections to him. Regular casting tools remain as Arcane Connections for a few weeks, his last years.

<span id="bound-magic"></span>
==== '''Bound Magic''' ====

Minor, Hermetic When you die, all of your spells\nend abruptly and any magic\nitems that you created cease to function. You cannot take this Flaw with Harnessed Magic (page 85), as that Virtue already\nincludes this effect.

<span id="bound-to-realm"></span>
==== Bound to (Realm) ====

Major, Supernatural The character is no longer able to survive in the mundane world, and sickens if it is outside a particular sort of supernatural aura for an extended period of time. The character must live in a supernatural aura of 5 or greater to remain healthy; if it spends most of a season outside such an aura, make a Stamina Roll against an Ease Factor of (9)

* Size). If you fail the roll, the character sustains a Heavy wound, unless the previous season it also failed such a roll, in which case it sustains an Incapacitating wound instead. Choose the realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) to which the character is bound when you take the Flaw.

<span id="bound-to-role-role"></span>
==== Bound to (Role) Role ====

Minor, Supernatural This character is physically bonded to some form of device, whether through a mystic event, long years of exposure and warping, or the ministrations of an experimental magus. The degree of the bonding is for the troupe to define, but the bonding may be physical, such as a locksmith whose fingers are picks, files, and keys, or mystical, such as a watchman who is confined to his watch

The manner of this bonding determines the kind of life that the character may live. A watchman unable to leave his tower may make it his home, while a coachman who has become part of his coach cannot survive for long once separated from it.

tower as though contained by

an unbreakable ward.

If separated from the bonded device or place in any way, the character must make deprivation checks as though deprived of food (i.e., a check every three days). The effects of this are canceled if the character is brought into contact with the device or returned to his bound place, at which point they rebond.

This Flaw also includes the effects of the Unaging Virtue, but the character's apparent age advances in line with their physical age. Role-Bound characters retain the need to sleep and breathe and those not physically bonded to a device, such as those bound to a place, retain their other physical needs.

This Flaw may originate from any of the Supernatural Realms: a magical origin might represent the expression of an

Essential Trait, a faerie origin could show that the character occupies an archetypal role, ready to play his part in the wider story, while divine and infernal origins may represent eternal punishment on Earth.

This Flaw may only be taken by grogs and is suitable for the Warping to a Pattern Minor Site Hook presented in ''Covenants'', page 11.

<span id="branded-criminal"></span>
==== '''Branded Criminal''' ====

Minor, Social Status As punishment for some crime in your past, a mark has been burned into your cheek. This adversely affects your ability to function in society. You may not take the Wealthy Virtue, but you may take Martial Abilities at character creation. You may choose not to take such abilities, if your crime was not violent.

<span id="broken-vessel"></span>
==== Broken Vessel ====

Minor, Supernatural The character is constantly aware that her supernatural powers may only be temporary. Failures using those abilities represent the ebbing away of

Characters may only take this Flaw if they have at least one Supernatural Ability or Art normally improved through experience points.

<span id="brutal-artist"></span>
==== '''Brutal Artist''' ====

Minor. Hermetic This Flaw is only available to magi of House Jerbiton. The magus creates and enjoys art that is ugly, according to his Housemates. He suffers a -3penalty on social rolls with Jerbiton magi, and cannot develop a positive Reputation in the House, because his mind is so obviously disturbed. This restricts his involvement in the leagues (see Houses of Hermes: Societates, page 53). Over time, the character might convince his sodales that his work is not ugly, but this requires stories, much as removing any other Flaw.

<span id="busybody"></span>
==== Busybody ====

Minor, Personality You usually know everything that is going on among your friends and acquaintances, especially in private matters. You are always interested in rumors and gossip, and are frequently able to extract personal secrets from people. Among magi the language is more dignified, but the idea is the same: you keep tabs on the Hermetic community (your covenant, your House, and nearby covenants — at the least). However, magi probably don't have much knowledge of what's going on among the lower-class members of their covenant unless they choose to apply this Flaw specifically to such people at character creation.

<span id="carefree"></span>
==== Carefree ====

Minor, Personality You are unshakably cheerful and happy in all circumstances.

<span id="careless-sorcerer"></span>
==== Careless Sorcerer ====

Minor, Hermetic You are slapdash in your use of magical power, and must roll two more botch dice than normal when casting spells. Note that if you would normally roll no botch dice, you still roll none.

<span id="careless-with-ability"></span>
==== Careless with (Ability) ====

Minor, General The character is particularly reckless when it comes to a particular Ability, chosen when this Virtue is taken. This Ability should be one that is important to the character, or the troupe may veto the choice of this Flaw. When she fails, she does so dramatically. Whenever she rolls a zero when using the Ability, that zero is treated as a botch. She may need to roll extra botch dice depending on the circumstances, but she always suffer the effects of at least a single botch. This Flaw may be taken more than once; each time, it applies to a

<span id="castratus"></span>
==== Castratus ====

Minor, General

different Ability.

You were castrated before puberty, leaving you beardless and somewhat effeminate compared to most men. Social rolls involving characters from Latin culture suffer a -3 penalty. Under Byzantine law you may not marry, although you may adopt children. In Byzantine culture, this may have been an astute career move on your guardians' part, as eunuchs can attain positions of power. Elsewhere, it was probably the result of an accident or an assault. This Flaw is only available to characters who were born with testicles.

<span id="ceremonial-spontaneous-magic"></span>
==== Ceremonial Spontaneous Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

You need time and effort to focus your Spontaneous magic. You can only cast Spontaneous spells using the rules for Ceremonial Casting (page 217).

This Flaw is not compatible with Difficult Spontaneous Magic or Weak Spontaneous Magic.

<span id="chaotic-magic"></span>
==== Chaotic Magic ====

Major, Hermetic

Your magic is very wild. When you cast a spontaneous spell, you must specify a desired level of effect. If you fall short of or exceed that target by more than one level, the spell still works, but its effects are beyond your control—the storyguide decides the results. The level of effect includes any levels you assign to Penetration.

<span id="church-upbringing"></span>
==== Church Upbringing ====

Minor, Personality This Flaw covers children schooled by the Church and mostly raised by clerics as well, a fate befalling some orphans, bastards, Gifted children, and other misfits. The Church may act out of charity or a wealthy individual may have paid to discreetly get a difficult child out of the way. This secluded upbringing leaves the character less knowledgeable about the rest of society, which he finds unstructured, uncouth, and confusing. The player must spend 25 experience points from the normal budget on Artes Liberales, Latin, Music, Organization Lore: Church, or Theology. Unless the character has a Virtue that permits it, no other experience points may be spent on Academic Abilities.

<span id="close-family-ties"></span>
==== Close Family Ties ====

Minor, Story Your family is one of the most important things in your life, and still supports and aids you whenever possible, even at personal risk. Family members do not hesitate to do you any favor that is within their power, and can call on their friends and neighbors to help you. It works both ways, however, your family will require help from you some day.

<span id="clumsy"></span>
==== Clumsy ====

Minor, General You are not very graceful and tend to drop things — you are at –3 in all related rolls.

Furthermore, roll an extra botch die when taking actions related to Dexterity. Roleplay your clumsiness.

<span id="clumsy-magic"></span>
==== Clumsy Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

You have trouble targeting your spells accurately. Any aiming roll is subject to disastrous failure: an aiming roll of 0 is automatically a botch. (Aiming rolls do not count as mystical rolls for the purposes of gaining Warping Points.) You receive a –3 penalty to any rolls involving Finesse.

<span id="companion-animal"></span>
==== Companion Animal ====

Minor, Social Status, animals only The character is the Animal Companion of another character (either a player character or a storyguide character) and therefore has little control over his own life. He is largely dependent on his master for food and shelter, and has an additional Personality Trait of &quot;Loyal to Master&quot; which represents this bond. Among people who know his master, the character is treated better than he would be, perhaps as that person's pet or bodyguard. Others most likely treat him as a brute or a dumb beast.

<span id="compassionate"></span>
==== Compassionate ====

Major or Minor, Personality You help anyone who is wounded or in trouble. You cannot bear to see suffering in others, although you happily drive yourself to exhaustion.

<span id="compulsion"></span>
==== Compulsion ====

Major or Minor, Personality You have an unfortunate urge that you have trouble resisting. Examples include drinking, sex, perfection, bragging, or gambling.

<span id="compulsive-lying"></span>
==== Compulsive Lying ====

Major or Minor, Personality Telling the truth is really hard for this character. This does not apply in situations where the answer is evident and any lie would be transparent; he does not claim that the sky is green under normal conditions. However, when he cannot be immediately caught out, he finds it hard to avoid embellishing stories, or simply making them up. Perhaps

he wants to make himself look good, perhaps he wants to downplay his own part in a conflict, or perhaps he just loves the power of confusing people.

The Constant Expression

Major, Hermetic The maga forms the center of a magical maelstrom, perpetually casting non-fatiguing Spontaneous magic effects. The resulting effects are minor due to the nature of non-fatiguing Spontaneous magic but are likely to cause distraction and/or other problems. Though nonfatiguing, the effort of marshaling the magic into less dangerous forms is tiring and the maga is considered to have lost one long-term Fatigue level which cannot be regained through sleep.

The effects produced by the constant expression may target anything that the maga could normally target with spontaneous spell, including herself, although they are more likely to target things touched by or seen by the maga.

The maga may actively concentrate in order to suppress this automatic magic entirely, making an initial Stamina + Concentration simple roll against Ease Factor 3 + (Warping Score). On a failure, a further roll is allowed every two minutes after the maga has composed herself. If the magic has been suppressed, the maga may cast Spontaneous and Formulaic spells normally.

In order to cast Ceremonial or Ritual magic the maga must make a Concentration roll as described above. One attempt can be made every 15 minutes, a successful attempt sufficient to cover the duration of the casting. Nevertheless, the maga suffers a number of additional botch dice equal to her Warping Score.

The constant expression of magic also makes laboratory work inherently risky. Any laboratory the maga works in is treated as having a free Flaw providing a Safety penalty of –3 (see page 288).

Penalties from foreign auras, or from effects such as Aegis of the Hearth, may dampen the constant expression. Where the penalty reduces the casting total to 0, no magic is expressed.

The player should decide, based on personality, sigil, and favored arts, how the constant expression most often manifests, though the storyguide may vary the actual effect scene-by-scene.

Conciatta of Bonisagus, a brilliant theorist of the tenth century who extended Hermetic magic to affect the Divine, Faerie, and Infernal realms, famously suffered from this Flaw, which is otherwise extremely rare. Other magi may assume that a character who has it has some connection with her. More details of Conciatta can be found in Legends of Hermes.

<span id="consumed-casting-tools"></span>
==== Consumed Casting Tools ====

Minor, Hermetic

The character's casting tools are magically consumed after he uses them. It takes an hour to make a new casting tool. Regular casting tools do not allow the magus to make multiple copies of them, so he may not stock up on casting tools. Making a casting tool for a spell that already has a casting tool erases the magical connection from the existing tool to the spell. The magus does not need a laboratory to make casting tools. This Flaw may only be taken by Verditius magi.

<span id="continence"></span>
==== Continence ====

Minor, Personality You do not engage in sexual activity. This may be due to a vow of celibacy, or simply personal choice.

<span id="corrupted-abilities"></span>
==== Corrupted Abilities ====

Minor, Supernatural, Tainted One or more of the character's Abilities was taught to her by a demon, or came through some\nother corrupted source of study. Use of a corrupted Ability for a selfish or sinful action receives a +3 bonus to the roll. Succeeding in a roll because of this bonus (that is, when without it the roll would have failed) means that the character

immediately acquires 5 experience points in that Ability. However, uses of the Ability that are neutral or selfless receive a –3 penalty, and if you fail the roll because of this penalty, the character loses 5 experience points in the Ability.

Any use of a corrupted Ability is an unholy act, which can be sensed by Divine Powers. You may only take this Flaw once, though you can choose to have it affect multiple Abilities if you wish.

Corrupted Arts

Minor, Hermetic, Tainted

The character has studied one of the Hermetic Arts from a corrupted source. Use of a corrupted Art for a selfish or sinful action receives a +3 bonus to the character's Casting Total. Succeeding in a roll because of this bonus (that is, when without it the roll would have failed) means he immediately acquires 5 experience points in that Art. However, uses of the Art that are neutral or selfless receive a -3 penalty, and if you fail the roll because of this penalty, he immediately loses 5 experience points in the Art.

Any use of a corrupted Art taints the character's magic, causing it to appear unholy. You may only take this Flaw once, though it can affect multiple Arts.

Corrupted Spells

Minor, Hermetic, Tainted The character has learned at least 30 levels of formulaic spells from a source that has been corrupted in some way. Use of a corrupted spell for a selfish or sinful action receives a +3 bonus to the character's Casting Total and Penetration Total. Succeeding in a roll because of this bonus (that is, when without it the spell would have failed or cost Fatigue) means he immediately acquires 5 experience points towards mastery of that spell. However, uses of the spell that are neutral or selfless receive a -3 penalty, and if you fail the roll or he fatigues himself because of this penalty, he immediately loses 5

experience points. If this would result in negative experience, he forgets the spell completely.

Any use of a corrupted spell is tainted and appears unholy. You may only take this Flaw once, though it can affect as many of the character's spells as you wish.

<span id="covenant-upbringing"></span>
==== Covenant Upbringing ====

Minor, Personality You were raised in a large, old covenant that has little contact with the outside world. You might have very strange religious beliefs, and you certainly find medieval social and political structures very odd. You may take Latin at character creation, and are likely to have a score in Order of Hermes Lore. While Latin cannot be your native language, you may speak a language closely related to Latin that is spoken only at your home covenant.

<span id="craving-for-travel"></span>
==== Craving for Travel ====

Minor, General The character suffers from feelings of loneliness, boredom, and depression if he does not expose himself to new experiences. He can stave off the boredom for a while, but if he remains in one place for more than a season, he suffers a -1 penalty to all rolls and totals until he experiences a change in scene. This penalty rises to -3 after a year of boredom. This character is probably the first to volunteer for a mission beyond the covenant gates, and may even spend part of each year in a different location such as the nearby wood. This Flaw might seem to make the character unsuitable for life at a covenant, so you should decide what it is at the covenant that means he keeps coming back. Perhaps it is the love of his life, the camaraderie, or perhaps just the feeling that he fits in here.

<span id="creative-block"></span>
==== Creative Block ====

Minor, Hermetic You have problems creating new things in the lab. You take a –3 penalty to all Lab Totals unless you are using a Laboratory Text or being taught. If you experiment, roll twice as many dice on the experimentation table.

<span id="crippled"></span>
==== Crippled ====

Major, General You either have no legs, or your legs are completely useless. You may have lost them in an accident or as a punishment. You cannot walk, although you may drag yourself along the ground, or push a trolley around with a stick.

<span id="curse-of-slander"></span>
==== Curse of Slander ====

Minor, General or Supernatural Wherever he stays, unpleasant rumors and ill-favored stories about this character begin to spread within a short time. This can be due to bad luck, or it could be something supernatural, like a curse. The slander is centered on one specific section of mundane society — the nobility, the church, guilds, peasants — and it seriously hampers his working life. After staying one season in an area, he gains a bad Reputation at level 1, usually a Local Reputation. He gains one point toward raising the Reputation in each further season, or more if he is involved in disturbing or strange events. Truly remarkable deeds can halt the increase for one season, but they will be forgotten come next season. At a covenant, people are used to strange things and deviant behavior. The Reputation is gained and increases in intervals of years rather than seasons, giving the poor victim more time before he becomes completely shunned. If the character leaves an area, the Reputation stops increasing, and may even fall, at the troupe's discretion.

<span id="curse-of-venus"></span>
==== Curse of Venus ====

Major, Story You are very attractive to people whom you do not wish to attract. People you detest keep getting crushes on you, and will not be dissuaded. Furthermore, you tend to fall in

love with inappropriate people, and in inappropriate circumstances. Those people you are interested in tend to think you are vain and shallow.

<span id="cursed-guile"></span>
==== Cursed Guile ====

Minor, Supernatural This is the Flaw for &quot;the boy who cried wolf,&quot; and probably results from Infernal influence. The character has three extra botch dice when using Guile. More importantly, the character is rarely believed, even when he is being honest. He must make a Communication + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to be believed when he tells the truth at important moments. For example, if the character is returning from a scouting mission, and you fail his Guile roll when he reports back, the maga may assume that he has been deficient in his duties; perhaps she thinks that he never went scouting at all, but instead went to the nearest town to entertain himself. This character may prefer the company of animals to that of people, as they do not respond to subterfuge.

<span id="cyclic-magic-negative"></span>
==== Cyclic Magic (negative) ====

Minor, Hermetic As with the Hermetic Virtue, your magic is attuned to some cycle of nature and is less potent at specific times. You have a –3 penalty to all Lab Totals and Casting Scores during that time. The penalty applies to Lab Totals\neven if the negative period does not cover the whole of the season. The length of time during which you are at a disadvantage must be equal to the time when there is no penalty.

<span id="dark-secret"></span>
==== Dark Secret ====

Major, Story You are haunted by something that would lead to shame, rejection, and possibly revenge if discovered. Hints about the secret continually arise, and there might be others who know it and could betray you. This makes you avoid certain places, dislike certain people, or fear certain things.

<span id="deaf"></span>
==== Deaf ====

Major, General You cannot hear at all. You may be able to speak, but you cannot\nunderstand spoken language, which makes communication difficult. Magi with this Flaw must roll an extra two botch dice when casting spells with a spoken component, as they cannot hear what they are saying.

<span id="a-deal-with-the-devil"></span>
==== A Deal with the Devil ====

Major, Story The character has sold his soul to the devil and now finds himself destined to infernal damnation. This Flaw includes the effects of Plagued By Supernatural Entity as Hell's agents goad and cajole the character, reminding him of the bargain he made and tempting him with offers of possible release in return for just one more small service. The character is called upon to undertake an inherently sinful action, but the reward is always snatched away on some technicality of the agreement or simply because of the duplicitous nature of the infernal. Note that the character can, in fact, repent and get out of the deal by God's grace, but the repentance must be genuine, and the forces of Hell will try to stop it, thus generating stories that way.

<span id="deficient-form"></span>
==== '''Deficient Form''' ====

Minor, Hermetic Almost all totals (including Casting Totals and Lab Totals, but excluding Magic Resistance) to which a particular Form is added are halved. Advancement Totals are not halved. Experience points required are based on the actual value of the Technique, before halving.

<span id="deficient-technique"></span>
==== Deficient Technique ====

Major, Hermetic All totals, including Lab and Casting totals, including a particular Technique are halved. Advancement Totals are not halved. Experience points required are based on the actual value of the Technique, before halving.

<span id="deleterious-circumstances"></span>
==== '''Deleterious Circumstances''' ====

Minor, Hermetic All your magic totals, excluding Magic Resistance, are halved under certain uncommon circumstances. This can be your state, such as sitting or wet, the target of the magic, such as wild animals or iron, or the place where you are casting the magic, such as a city or high up a mountain.

<span id="delusion"></span>
==== Delusion ====

Minor, Personality You believe wholeheartedly in something that just isn't so. Examples include that you are a magus (if you are not), that you are the Pope's child, or that your imaginary friend is real.

<span id="demonic-familiar"></span>
==== Demonic Familiar ====

Minor, Story The character is bound to a famulus, a familiar demon that possesses an animal and can lend the character its senses, or mask the evil taint of her Powers. This demonic familiar is not loyal to the character or concerned about her well-being, and often has its own goals and

needs. The character may occasionally need to bargain with it or even threaten it to receive its aid.

At the storyguide's discretion, this Flaw may be taken to represent other sorts of demons with which the character has a close relationship, such as a warder, teacher, or paramour. The more powerful the demon, the more the character will be expected to do to earn its assistance, and the less involved it will be with her on a daily basis.

<span id="dependent"></span>
==== Dependent ====

Major, Story You feel responsible for someone, and bound to help if they are in trouble. This person may be a relative or friend, but should be relatively weak and a non-player character. If your Dependent passes beyond your ability to help, or becomes too powerful, you should substitute another Story Flaw. Possibilities include taking the children of the old Dependent as new dependents, taking the killers of the Dependent as Enemies, or taking the Dependent as a True Friend.

<span id="depraved"></span>
==== Depraved ====

Major or Minor, Personality The character seeks to undermine religion whenever possible, and generally tries to avoid the Dominion. He might sin in public, teach misinformation about the tenets of the faith, or show obvious disdain for holy things. He is not necessarily an infernalist; it could be that he simply despises organized religion, dislikes the Divine realm, or does not believe in God. He might even be persuaded to attend services, though he does not take any of it seriously and is likely to disrupt the ceremony with his discomfort and ignorance.

<span id="depressed"></span>
==== Depressed ====

Minor, Personality You have a dark outlook on life, seeing little point in acting and taking no pleasure in anything that happens.

<span id="deteriorating-power"></span>
==== '''Deteriorating Power''' ====

Minor, Supernatural Like the Variable Powers Virtue, this Flaw reduces the\neffectiveness of one of the character's powers (Greater, Lesser, or Ritual) over time. This penalty is linked to either the character's (age / 10), (Might Score – Might Pool / 5), or Warping Score. For example, a magic character with Deteriorating Powers linked to age and an age of 25 would have one of his powers reduced by 3 magnitudes.

This Flaw may be taken more than once, if the character has more than one Power.

<span id="devoted-parentchild"></span>
==== Devoted Parent/Child ====

Minor, General The character is extremely attached to a parent or child. Where he goes, she goes also. Separation of more than a day causes anxiety, and gives a -1 penalty to all rolls due to stress.

<span id="dhimmi"></span>
==== Dhimmi ====

Minor, General You are a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule. If you are adult and male, you must pay the jizya head tax, and all dhimmis must abide by certain social restrictions (described in the sourcebooks for these areas of Mythic Europe — see Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, The Cradle and the Crescent, Between Sand and Sea, and Lands of the Nile), in return for which they receive tolerance and protection from the Muslim authorities. The actual amount a dhimmi has to pay in jizva varies, but rarely exceeds a dinar (a gold coin) per year.

<span id="diabolic-past"></span>
==== Diabolic Past ====

Major, Story You were associated with diabolists, and though you have\nescaped their evil ways, you are still haunted by your upbringing and the memory of acts best left\nunspoken. Perhaps your parents were diabolists, although you were not, or maybe you joined a cult but soon repented and fled. Your former associates still take an interest in your activities and whereabouts. Unfortunately. You

may purchase the Ability Infernal Lore, even if you are normally not permitted to buy Arcane Abilities.

<span id="difficult-longevity-ritual"></span>
==== Difficult Longevity Ritual ====

Major, Hermetic

Something in your magical nature makes it difficult to create an effective Longevity Ritual for you. Anyone (including yourself) creating a Longevity Ritual for you must halve their Lab Total. You may create Longevity Rituals for others without penalty.

<span id="difficult-spontaneous-magic"></span>
==== Difficult Spontaneous Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

Spontaneous magic is always an effort for you. You cannot cast Spontaneous spells without exerting yourself. However, when you do exert yourself, you cast spells as any other magus.

This Flaw may be combined with Weak Spontaneous Magic (page 153) to create a magus who cannot use Spontaneous magic at all.

<span id="disjointed-magic"></span>
==== Disjointed Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic You cannot use previous knowledge to help you with magic. You gain no benefit from knowing a spell that is similar to one you are learning or\ninventing, and you gain no\nenchantment bonuses from

Techniques and Forms already invested in an item.

<span id="difficult-underlings"></span>
==== Difficult Underlings ====

Major, Story You may only take this Story Flaw if your character has, and will keep, underlings of some sort or another. No matter how many people you fire, or how carefully you vet new candidates, your underlings always cause problems for you. The nature of the problems may change, but you are repeatedly drawn into dealing with the trouble they have caused. If other people give the same underlings orders, they have no problem. It's not them, it's you.

<span id="disfigured"></span>
==== Disfigured ====

Minor, General A visible disfigurement makes you ugly and easy to recognize. Presence rolls that involve good looks and gaining respect from most people are at -3. You probably have a cruel nickname that refers to your unfortunate appearance. You might have a large, visible burn scar, or an enlarged and deformed eye (an 'evil eye'), or even be albino.

<span id="disorientating-magic"></span>
==== Disorientating Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

After casting a spell, you must spend a round doing nothing but recovering your mental faculties.

<span id="driver"></span>
==== Driver ====

Major or Minor, Personality You have some goal which you are determined to bring about. This has to be the sort of big goal that could shape an entire life, but if you do accomplish it you will immediately turn to a new project.

<span id="dutybound"></span>
==== Dutybound ====

Minor, Personality

You adhere to a restrictive code of conduct that forbids certain behavior, probably including prohibitions against lying, killing prisoners, stealing, and other occasionally useful actions. You follow this code out of guilt or fear rather than high-flown moral standards, and may spend more time justifying yourself than keeping your conduct pure.

<span id="dwarf"></span>
==== Dwarf ====

Major, General

You are the size of a child. Your comfortable walking speed is two-thirds that of a normal person. Your Size is -2, so the severity of wounds you take increases in three point increments rather than five point increments (see page 404). You take a -1 penalty to each of Strength and Stamina, which may reduce each Characteristic as low as -6. You cannot take this Flaw and Giant Blood (page 83), Large (page 89), or Small Frame (page 145).

<span id="employed-by-company"></span>
==== Employed by Company ====

Minor, Story

Characters with this Flaw are salaried employees, answerable to an employer, which is normally a merchant company. They may be merchants who travel on behalf of a company, or administrators who

are answerable to the partners. On the other hand, they are also backed up by the resources of the company. This Flaw may also be used for salaried employees of other organizations.

<span id="enemies"></span>
==== Enemies ====

Major, Story Someone is causing trouble for you, such as a local baron or bishop, a band of outlaws, or a really nasty innkeeper. The enemy must be powerful enough to endanger you — this is best agreed on with the storyguide and the rest of the troupe.

<span id="enfeebled"></span>
==== Enfeebled ====

Major, General

You cannot exert yourself for longer than a few seconds. Any need for rapid movement, such as combat or a chase, leaves you helpless. Long hikes are likewise beyond your capability. You are unable to learn Martial Abilities or any other skills involving physical exertion, since you cannot train in them. If you are a magus, you lose double the normal number of Fatigue levels from casting spells, but you may carry out Laboratory activities as normal.

<span id="envied-beauty"></span>
==== '''Envied Beauty''' ====

Major, Story

The character's beauty draws revulsion and jealousy. This envy does not strike everyone, but vain persons of the character's gender are particularly susceptible to it. Characters with this Flaw may avoid its penalties by refusing to reveal their beauty to the world, which creates its own complications.

A character lacking a positive Presence score may not have this Flaw.

<span id="envious"></span>
==== Envious ====

Major or Minor, Personality You believe that everyone has it better than you do, and that they don't deserve their good fortune, while you do. Thus, you try to ruin their lives and take their goods for yourself. (This is not a good Flaw for a player character, as it is likely to lead to conflict with the other players.)

<span id="environmental-magic-condition"></span>
==== Environmental Magic Condition ====

Major, Hermetic

All of the character's Casting and Lab Totals are halved in certain common conditions related to his environment, for example, whenever he is inside. Note that this should be significantly more restrictive than the Hermetic Flaw Deleterious Circumstances.

<span id="environmental-sensitivity"></span>
==== '''Environmental Sensitivity''' ====

Minor, General

The character is unusually sensitive to an uncommon environmental feature, such as bad air, salt water, or extreme temperatures. Whenever the character is exposed to these conditions, he has a –3 penalty to his Stamina for any debilitation checks (page 406).

<span id="evil-destiny"></span>
==== '''Evil Destiny''' ====

Major, Story

The Infernal realm has taken an interest in the character, but he does not know how or why. Perhaps one of his Powers is actually Infernal, or demons are plotting against him, or he is convinced that he is being stalked by something evil.

He cannot discuss this openly for fear that he will be accused of infernalism, but must be always on his guard against the dark forces that he knows will come for him one day.

The storyguide will use this Flaw to subtly work the Infernal realm into your character, leaving you unaware of the specifics. You might have other Flaws that relate to the Infernal, but not (yet) know what they are, such as Corrupted Abilities. The character could also simply be Plagued by Demons or Susceptible to the Infernal. Through the course of the story vou may eventually discover what his Flaw is, but until then you are only haunted with the knowledge that something about him is not right.

<span id="evil-eye"></span>
==== Evil Eye ====

Minor, Supernatural You character bears the Evil Eye, the uncontrolled potential to bring harm to others around her. Characters making stress rolls in her presence are subject to an additional botch die. Characters may protect themselves through the use of an amulet or a ritual, decided upon by the troupe, which does not need to be magical or supernatural in nature. A Magic Resistance of 0 or more, including the effect of the Aegis of the Hearth, is also sufficient to guard against this effect.

<span id="exciting-experimentation"></span>
==== '''Exciting Experimentation''' ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your character's experiments tend to have a flair for the ... dramatic. When rolling on any of the experimentation tables, roll two dice instead of the normal one.

The storyguide then chooses and applies the more amusing of your two results.

<span id="excommunicate"></span>
==== Excommunicate ====

Major, Story For your crimes against God and the Church, you have been cast out of your faith, undoing your baptism and driving you from your religious community. You have a bad reputation at level 3 within the Church, and cannot benefit from the sacraments.

<span id="exiled-atlantean"></span>
==== '''Exiled Atlantean''' ====

Minor, Supernatural The character is an exiled Atlantean, she is tainted by her contact with the surface world, and cannot return to her magic regio. This exile is enforced by the very nature of the magic regio to which the Atlanteans are native, so there is no authority figure to which she may appeal, or any obvious method of returning to favor. The exile applies even if the Atlantean left her native magic regio involuntarily. More details about the Atlanteans can be found in Realms of Power: Magic, page 90.

<span id="faerie-friend"></span>
==== Faerie Friend ====

Minor, Story You have an ally among the fay. How much assistance you can get depends on the power of the friend — a small faerie with (relatively) minor powers can accompany you on a day to day basis. Powerful faeries have other business, and may only be available to answer questions and provide guidance, not to accompany you around on your adventures. Your ally is fully sentient, has its own powers. and can speak when it chooses. You may want to have another player act the part. While a faerie companion can be a great boon, it can also be a terrible burden. If it is nasty or mischievous, it could cause trouble for you everywhere. Characters with this Flaw can purchase the Arcane Knowledge Faerie Lore, even if they are normally restricted from purchasing it.

<span id="faerie-upbringing"></span>
==== Faerie Upbringing ====

Minor, Personality Perhaps you were abandoned by your true kin, and the faeries found you. Maybe your family actually lived in a faerie forest, or faeries took you as a babe. Though you are now back in human society, you feel at home with and have an enhanced\nunderstanding of faeries, magic, and other strange things. However, you find human society, including religion, bizarre. You may learn Faerie Lore at character generation.

<span id="failed-journeyman"></span>
==== Failed Journeyman ====

Minor, Social Status The character has been expelled from a guild due to past illegal or questionable practices. He may not practice his trade in town nor sell his goods there. The character is expected to find another means of livelihood, although no other guild will accept him, so many such men must find a way to practice their trade illegally. He has a bad Reputation of 2 in town.

<span id="failed-master"></span>
==== Failed Master ====

Minor, Social Status Either through faulty management or illegal business practices, the character has run his workshop\ninto the ground. He must work as a journeyman if he wants to practice his trade legally in town. The character has a bad Reputation of 4 in town, and it will be difficult for him to regain his legal status as a master.

<span id="failed-monk"></span>
==== Failed Monk ====

Minor, Social Status You were once a member of a cloistered order, but were cast out for some great sin or gross incompetence, or perhaps you ran away and your abbot might allow you to come back after a suitable punishment. Because of this, you have a poor Reputation at level 2 in the local area and within the Church. You no longer need to observe your monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, though you may still practice them as they might be ingrained in your nature. You

may take Academic Abilities during character creation.

Female characters may take this Flaw as Failed Nun.

<span id="failed-student"></span>
==== Failed Student ====

Minor, General The character has studied for a specific university license and failed his final examination. If he passed earlier exams, he may have a scholastic Social Status Virtue showing how far he got. (Obviously, this cannot be Doctor in (Faculty).) The character has a Bad Academic Reputation of 2.

<span id="the-falling-evil"></span>
==== The Falling Evil ====

Major, General The character occasionally suffers convulsions and blackouts. Convulsions occur randomly and infrequently; for any given event, the storyguide should secretly roll a stress die. and if the result is 9 or more then a convulsion will occur at some point during that event, as chosen by the storyguide. This spasm causes random movements and hallucinations, leaving the character temporarily Incapacitated. She collapses to the ground and twitches, and you can make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 every round; success means that the convulsion ends, although the character is reduced to the Dazed Fatigue level following a fit. The Falling Evil is usually caused by possession by demons (Art &amp; Academe, page 48), but that form of the illness is usually temporary in nature. The character does not seem to have a disease, and cannot naturally recover from this affliction. It may be that it stems from a different source. In Ancient Greece and Rome, it was called the &quot;divine illness,&quot; as it was believed that the gods spoke to those who had such fits.

<span id="false-power"></span>
==== False Power ====

Major, Supernatural, Tainted One of the character's Supernatural Virtues is associated with the Infernal realm, in addition to the realm with which\nit would normally be associated,

which causes it to appear unholy when subjected to Divine or Infernal investigation. This quality could be because of something inherent to the Power, or perhaps because of the interference of Infernal agents.

This Flaw can apply to Supernatural Virtues that define the character's background, like Faerie Blood, Diedne Magic, or even The Gift. In these cases, falsehood permeates the whole of the character's being, causing everything she does to seem unholy to those with the ability to sense it.

The False Power is often subtly changed by its Infernal aspect, making it more sinister or negative. Here are some examples:

(False) Premonitions: The taint of the character's Premonitions Power leaves it vulnerable to Infernal manipulation, even if the character has Magic Resistance. Many of the character's premonitions are accurate, and pursuit of the stories they evoke is usually worthwhile. These valuable insights often lead characters to trust lies that a demon offers through the Power in order to manipulate their response to pivotal events.

(False) Second Sight: The character is particularly likely to see through an illusion or deception when what he sees would lead him to

sin. Sometimes he may see through mundane obstacles, if the information gained would tempt him to sinful acts.

(False) Shapeshifter. The character can change his shape, but only into animals typically associated with the Infernal, such as a cat, a wolf, a raven, or a rat. When in these shapes, he seems unholy to those can recognize that quality.

It is quite possible that the character does not know that his Power is false. Once he does, he may find himself in a moral dilemma. Most people consider it a sin to use Powers associated with the Infernal realm for any reason, and would label him an infernalist if they discovered the nature of his Power. Yet his Power is also associated with another realm, making it more difficult to recognize it as Infernal, and leaving it unclear whether the Power is inherently evil or simply tainted by association. Perhaps the character believes it is not wrong for him to use his Powers, so long as he does not pursue evil ends with them.

Once the character recognizes that the Power has an unholy aspect, he may choose to treat it as an Infernal Power at any time, using the Infernal Power column of the realm interaction chart and thus giving him a bonus in Infernal auras. This may also grant him other benefits: like other infernalists he can boost his casting total with sacrifices, and use an Infernal Ceremony to include others in the activation, as described in Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 91. However, doing this removes any illusions about the Power's realm — even magical and faerie Powers can recognize that it is Infernal.

If the character realizes his Power is corrupted, he may decide to seek help from the Divine. Sincere repentance and participation in a form of ceremonial absolution allow the character to lose this Flaw, though this also takes away the Virtue it modifies. This is a heavy penance, but it is the only way to exorcise the evil influence of the Infernal realm,

and of course there are far greater rewards in Heaven.

This Flaw may be taken multiple times, once for each appropriate Supernatural Virtue that the character possesses, but in each subsequent instance as a Minor Flaw rather than a Major one. Also note that this Flaw cannot apply to Supernatural Virtues that are affiliated to the Infernal realm in the first place, and the troupe may not allow it to apply to Virtues derived from the Divine.

<span id="favors"></span>
==== '''Favors''' ====

Major, Story

You owe a boon to someone (or to a great many people), and may be called upon to return the favor at any time. The consequences of ignoring such a request can range from mild to deadly serious, at the storyguide's discretion.

<span id="fear"></span>
==== Fear ====

Minor, Personality

You are scared of something that you are likely to encounter fairly often. Its presence makes you edgy and very uncomfortable.

<span id="feral-scent"></span>
==== Feral Scent ====

Minor, General

Perhaps due to his beast blood or feral upbringing, the character has the strong natural smell of a wild animal. Humans tend to avoid being too close to him, and may be on edge in his vicinity without knowing why. He may well spook domesticated animals if he surprises them. He suffers a -1 penalty to social interactions (which stacks with the penalties imposed by The Gift, if he has it), and develops a negative Reputation of Unclean at level 2. However, if he has Initiated the Sensory Magic Mystery (described in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 27), any spells he casts with a Scent Target have twice their normal area of effect.

<span id="feral-upbringing"></span>
==== Feral Upbringing ====

Minor, General

You grew up in the wilderness, either raised by wild animals or surviving on your own. For much of your life you could not speak, and knew nothing of human

ways. Now that you have joined human society (or the covenant), you have learned to understand some basic spoken phrases, but civilized life is still a mystery you want little part of. You may only choose beginning Abilities that you could have learned in the wilds. In particular, you may not start with a score in a Language. In your first five years you gain 120 experience points, which must be split between (Area) Lore, Animal Handling, Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Hunt, Stealth, Survival, and Swim.

<span id="fettered-magic"></span>
==== Fettered Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

All of your spells and the effects of any magic items you activate are Arcane Connections to you. You cannot take this with the Virtue Tethered Magic, as the Virtue already includes this effect.

<span id="feud"></span>
==== Feud ====

Major, Story Your family is involved in a feud. The opposing family or families are roughly of\nequivalent strength to your family and its allies. You are liable to be ambushed or attacked by opposing clansmen, and your family expects you to join raids against your enemies.

<span id="fickle-nature"></span>
==== Fickle Nature ====

Minor, Personality The character swings between two types of personality behaviors that are directly opposite. There is no middle ground, so the character is always either displaying traits of one behavior or the other. Select a Personality Trait at +4, and its opposite at +4. Typical Personality Traits are: Happy and Sad, Energetic and Lazy, Confident and Diffident, or Proud and Humble.

<span id="fish-out-of-water-terrain"></span>
==== Fish Out of Water (Terrain) ====

Minor, General

This character has an affinity with one type of terrain, whether this is at sea, in the woods, the rolling hills, or in the urban landscape of towns and cities, and feels uncomfortable and awkward when away from where he wants to be. The

character suffers a –1 penalty to all stress rolls taken outside of their favored terrain and also rolls one more botch dice than normal in those situations.

Appropriate areas may be Cities &amp; Towns, Villages, Rivers, The Sea, Mountains, Woodland, Desert, etc.

This Flaw may only be taken once, because taking it more than once makes it less serious, rather than more.

<span id="flashbacks"></span>
==== Flashbacks ====

Minor, General When engaged in combat, or a similar violent and tense situation, the stress might trigger a flashback to the horrors of past battles, which left this character mentally scarred. The hallucinations seem so real that it is hard to avoid reacting to them. When an event appropriate for the Flashbacks occurs, roll a stress die against an Ease Factor of 9. On a failure, the character panics and reverts to his past nightmares. At the storyguide's discretion, modifiers from -1 to -5 could apply, for things like full-scale battle, fires, or stampeding animals. In addition, add or subtract any relevant Personality Traits, depending on whether they might lessen or worsen the effects of this Flaw.

Bear in mind that positive traits like loyal, reliable, lawabiding, or calm should be helpful in avoiding this affliction. Similarly, negative traits like selfish, angry, or corrupt subtract from the roll, making him more likely to succumb. Often, his actions hurt, embarrass, or offend comrades, employers, or other important people, and might have social repercussions. On a botch, he'll get into real trouble — it could result in someone being seriously hurt or killed, in valuables being broken or in him failing in his duty at a critical time.

For magi, this Flaw should not involve flashbacks to Twilight episodes, spell botches or laboratory disasters. Since most of these situations won't get worse by applying a penalty to the rest of the scene, it won't be enough of a Flaw. But magi can be affected by combat, house fires, or cave-ins just as much as other character types.

<span id="flawed-parma-magica"></span>
==== Flawed Parma Magica ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your Parma Magica is defective and provides only half the normal Magic Resistance against a certain Form. You may purchase this Flaw more than once for different Forms.

<span id="flawed-powers"></span>
==== Flawed Powers ====

Minor, Supernatural The character must have at least one Major Supernatural Virtue to take this Flaw. The character's supernatural powers are limited or restricted in some fashion. She suffers the effects of a Major Hermetic Flaw (commonly Restriction or Necessary Condition), but it is applied to her Supernatural Virtues rather than to her Hermetic magic (if any) Any Flaw that is only appropriate to Hermetic Magic (for example, Deficient Technique or Unstructured Caster) cannot be taken with this Flaw. Note that the restriction on the supernatural power is not a separate Major Flaw: this Minor Flaw represents the fact that a Major Supernatural Virtue is less central to a character's activities than Hermetic magic is to a magus.

<span id="fluctuating-fortune"></span>
==== Fluctuating Fortune ====

Minor, Supernatural The character's finances rise and fall like the tide, regardless of how successful he is or what preventative measures he takes. He is considered to have the Wealthy Virtue one year, followed by the Poor Flaw the next. Besides monetary concerns, this means that the character will have to only work one season in one year, followed by a year in which he has to work three, all to maintain his livelihood. This cycle of feast and famine continues throughout the character's life, always in opposition to his financial desires. When he needs money most, he has none, and has an abundance of funds when they are superfluous.

Follower

Minor, Personality The character is a follower, not a leader. He rarely takes the initiative, but is usually happy to follow the direction of a forthright and decisive person. If he finds a leader, he tends to stick with her.

<span id="foreign-upbringing"></span>
==== Foreign Upbringing ====

Minor, Personality This Flaw is somewhat similar to Covenant Upbringing, but means that the character is a foreigner and comes from a remote or isolated corner of Mythic Europe. He appears and sounds nothing like the locals, has odd customs, habits, and religion (although he need not be pagan), and is quite confused by local society. However, he is not an Outsider, and has been accepted — for the most part. His Native Language is one foreign to the saga, and he

needs to learn another language in order to communicate with the rest of the turb. The maximum scores at character creation for locality-dependent Abilities like Language, Area Lore, or Organization Lore, as well as some social Abilities, are half (round up) that which his age normally allows.

(Form) Monstrosity

Minor, Supernatural This Flaw is primarily intended for animal characters, but may be taken for characters who are basically human with the approval of the troupe. The character is a monstrosity with a monstrous feature, or mutation, which corresponds to a magical Form. The feature may be beneficial in limited circumstances, but generally gives the character no advantage over its non-mutated peers.

Animals are not usually bothered by monsters — the character still has the correct scent, and behavior — and a single monstrous bull might be found happily living among a herd of otherwise normal cattle. for example. People, on the other hand, are highly troubled by the appearance of monstrosities, which they invariably attribute to malign influence: obviously monstrous animals are usually killed by peasants. Often, 1 pawn of Muto vis may be extracted from the corpse of a monstrous character, found concentrated in the monstrous feature.

Some examples of possible monstrosities are listed nearby, but the troupe may devise their own, as required:

<span id="fragile-constitution"></span>
==== Fragile Constitution ====

Minor, General You are sickly and weak. You suffer a -3 penalty on all rolls to recover from wounds and diseases.

<span id="frail"></span>
==== Frail ====

Minor, General The character is weak of build and easily hurt when undertaking physical activities. He has a -3 penalty to his Soak score.

Fury Major, Story A violent temper sometimes overwhelms you, sending you into a destructive, uncontrollable rage. You are likely to be provoked by some sort of specific event, such as being insulted, being hurt, or hearing the Order of Hermes disparaged. Roll 9+ on a stress die to avoid flying into a rage when such an event occurs, with another roll every round to try to calm yourself should you fail the first. On a botch, you try to kill everyone around you. While enraged you get +3 to Damage, but -1 on all other

<span id="gabai"></span>
==== Gabai ====

scores and rolls.

Minor, Social Status Appointed by the community council, the gabai is the local tax collector. It is his responsibility to\nensure that Jewish taxes, payable to the community on such things as wine and meat, are collected from all adult males.

The gabai has a –2 negative Reputation of &quot;Tax Collector&quot; in his community. This Flaw is compatible with any other Free Social Status Virtue.

<span id="gender-nonconforming"></span>
==== Gender Nonconforming ====

Major or Minor, Personality You do not conform to the expected behavior for a person of the gender that your society would assign to you in the absence of social cues such as clothes and behavior. This may mean, for example, that you dress as a member of another gender, or that you structure your life in a way considered appropriate to another gender, or that you are sexually attracted to members of the same gender. It does not necessarily mean that you disagree about what your gender is, although it may. As a Minor Flaw, it does not normally cause you problems, whether because your society accepts your behavior, or because you can turn people who object into newts, or for some other reason. As a Major Flaw, it does cause you problems.

<span id="generous"></span>
==== Generous ====

Major or Minor, Personality You willingly give away your property to anyone who expresses a desire for it, even if they are not particularly deserving. If something is very important, you might not give it to someone, but you will certainly share it.

<span id="greater-malediction"></span>
==== Greater Malediction ====

Major, Supernatural You have been cursed by some supernatural power, in a way that greatly hinders you. The effects of the curse should be comparable to those of other Major Flaws. Indeed, almost any Flaw could be the result of a curse.

<span id="greedy"></span>
==== Greedy ====

Major or Minor, Personality You like to eat and drink, and do so to excess whenever given the chance. You are probably fat, but may not be if you rarely have the chance to indulge.

<span id="grudge"></span>
==== Grudge ====

Minor, Personality For some reason, based on a past event, the character holds a strong grudge against someone who is part of his normal social circles, and with whom he would be expected to have cordial relations. He is constantly interested in what the other person is doing, what they are working on, and how he can outdo them.

<span id="gullible"></span>
==== Gullible ====

Minor, General

There is one born every minute - and it is this character! He is an easy victim of ruses, stories and teasing lies. People lying to him get a bonus to their Guile rolls of +1 to +3. Depending on how bright or sharp-witted he is, he might not fall for obvious lies, denials of things that are evident or common knowledge. However, he most likely falls for lies that are even remotely plausible, and if he has no idea whether or not something is true, he is almost certain to believe it. This could, for instance, be whether or not there are mischievous faeries under the bridge. If you really

want the character to not fall for something, make an Intelligence + Folk Ken Stress roll against an Ease Factor equal to the Communication + Guile roll of the person telling the tall tale. Recommended modifiers to the Ease Factor are +0 for obvious lies (ones that someone without the Flaw would certainly not believe), +6 for outlandish tales and +9 for things which could be true, or lies told by someone in authority, or who has expert knowledge of the subject at hand.

<span id="hallucinations"></span>
==== Hallucinations ====

Minor, General

The character is afflicted by vivid hallucinations which seem to be true visions, but rather than coming from a higher power, they are figments of her imagination and fantasy. She finds these visions particularly troublesome, and seeks meaning in them where there is none to be had. Coincidence might mean that some part of her hallucinations comes to pass, which only furthers her belief that there is meaning within them. If the character also has the Visions Flaw, then some of her visions are true, but most of them are meaningless jumbles of nonsense generated from within her mind.

<span id="harmless-magic"></span>
==== Harmless Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic The character's Perdo spells cannot permanently destroy anything; they temporarily disrupt the target, like Perdo Imaginem magic, but as soon as the duration has passed the target returns to its natural state as if nothing had happened, like a Muto effect. This means that a version of The Wound that Weeps (PeCo15), for example, briefly causes a painful, bleeding wound that immediately closes again. Likewise, Fist of Shattering (PeTe10) causes an object of stone or weaker material to briefly break apart, but then fuse itself together again. The character's Ritual Perdo spells function normally, however.

This weakness can be a boon to a crafty character. A maga might invent a spell to destroy a heavy rock at Concentration Duration; she could then cast it and lie in wait. When her enemy walks into the vacant space, she could release her concentration and crush her victim beneath it when it reforms. However, in most cases this limitation is a minor hindrance, as useful Perdo magic requires longer Durations.

Major or Minor, Personality You hate someone or some group so much that hurting them dominates your life. The target of your hatred must not be someone vou could easily overcome.

<span id="hedge-wizard"></span>
==== Hedge Wizard ====

Minor, Hermetic Because of your esoteric magic, other magi distrust you, and more importantly, grant you no respect. You start with a negative Reputation within the Order of Hermes at level 3 as a hedge wizard, even though you are a member of the Order.

<span id="heir"></span>
==== Heir ====

Minor, Story

You have little power or wealth now, but you stand to inherit land and possibly money. You need do nothing special to remain in your position, but others may occasionally attempt to remove you from the line of succession — one way or another. When you finally win your inheritance you gain its responsibilities as well, so your freedom may be restricted.

<span id="hermetic-patron"></span>
==== Hermetic Patron ====

Minor, Story You must be a Redcap or magus to take this Flaw.

You are watched over by an older magus or a more established Redcap, who considers you his charge and helps you out from time to time. This patron must be an NPC. Because of your special relationship, he is willing to do additional favors for you that cost him little, such as casting spells on you, lending you magic items, allowing you access to his books, providing you with mundane

materials, supporting you financially for a season or two, or even adopting you into his House. However, in return he will expect special attention from you, and may periodically send you on missions or assign you important tasks.

You may take this Flaw with a large group of magi as your patrons, though the more numerous your benefactors, the more you will be expected to do for them.

<span id="higher-purpose"></span>
==== Higher Purpose ====

Major or Minor, Personality Let others concern themselves with petty matters, you have a nobler goal. This purpose should be altruistic, like freeing an oppressed people or bringing peace between the Order of Hermes and society.

<span id="hobbled"></span>
==== Hobbled ====

Minor, General Both of the character's legs are severely damaged. She may not walk unless assisted by crutches or other devices, with which she can only move a mere half mile per hour. Any roll that requires moving quickly is penalized by –9. Her Dodge and other combat rolls are penalized by –6, and you roll double the normal botch dice in combat situations.

<span id="horrifying-appearance--snake-legs"></span>
== Horrifying Appearance – Snake Legs ==

Major, Supernatural You have no legs, and instead your hips give rise to two or more snake-like tails; you should consider how you survived childhood with this horrific deformity. Your movement is not hindered under most circumstances. You can hide this deformity under clothing, but you cannot move without revealing it, leaving you feigning being crippled as well.

<span id="humble"></span>
==== Humble ====

Minor, Personality You are humble, always willing to believe that others are more skilled and better than you. You do not necessarily\nunderestimate your own abilities, you just think others are better.

<span id="hunchback"></span>
==== Hunchback ====

Minor, General You have a deformed body that gives you a grotesque appearance and hinders your movements. You are at -3 to all rolls involving agility and balance. Communication rolls that involve good looks are at -3.

<span id="hunger-for-form-magic"></span>
==== Hunger for (Form) Magic ====

Major, Supernatural The character has been repeatedly exposed to magic and has thus become dependent upon magic to survive. The character must consume 1 pawn of vis each season, corresponding to the Form that it has been mostly exposed to. If the character is unable to consume a pawn of vis in a season, it loses a Long-Term Fatigue Level that cannot be regained until a pawn of the appropriate vis is consumed. For example, a character that has Hunger for Ignem Magic and has not consumed a pawn of Ignem vis for a whole year will have lost 4 Long-Term Fatigue Levels, and so be Dazed with a -5 penalty to activities. If the character then consumes 1 pawn of Ignem vis, it will regain a Fatigue Level and become Tired after an hour has elapsed.

<span id="imagined-folk-tradition-vulnerability"></span>
==== Imagined Folk Tradition Vulnerability ====

Minor, Personality Although this flaw closely resembles a Delusion, Imagined Folk Tradition Vulnerability has other game mechanical effects as well. This character utterly and sincerely believes that he has been touched by the fay, and that they have granted him his special skills — whether or not any such exist. So, naturally, he is convinced that he is as vulnerable to traditional wards and folk magic as the fey. Whenever there is talk about such folk remedies, or people around him try to perform them, he does his best to dissuade them. If he can get away with it, he removes or sabotage such wards; for instance, he sneaks around at night and removes any warding marks or materials at doorways. Finally, he exhibits strange behavior around active wards or ritualistic actions. This could be refusing to shake hands with a person right after they have drawn the sign of the cross, or flinching whenever salt is flung over someone's shoulder. On the plus side, this Flaw allows the character to purchase a score of 1 (but no more) in Faerie Lore at character creation. This is because he needs a rudimentary knowledge of the fay and the wards against them in order to be able to act this way. Without such knowledge. his behavior is based on what he thinks such wards might be.

<span id="impious-friend"></span>
==== Impious Friend ====

Minor, Story, Tainted A minor demon poses as a friend of the character. The demon takes a pleasant form but is usually invisible to anyone, other than its charge, who lacks appropriate supernatural abilities. Many of these demons are introduced to the tainted people they will defend and control during infancy. They become childhood playmates.

The tainted person has not bargained for the services of the demon. Instead, the character receives the services of his friend as part of its master's plan to guide the character toward a tragic destiny. If the demon feels the character's life is threatened, it may seek additional assistance from its master. The tainted person believes the demon wishes only the best for him. Many are ignorant of the demon's true shape.

<span id="incompatible-arts"></span>
==== Incompatible Arts ====

Minor, Hermetic For some reason you are completely unable to use two combinations of Techniques and Forms. For example, you may be unable to use Intellego Herbam and Intellego Animal. You may not use these Arts together even if one or both are requisites. This Flaw may be taken repeatedly with different combinations, but may not be combined with a Deficiency (see page 125).

<span id="incomprehensible"></span>
==== Incomprehensible ====

Minor, General You are almost completely\nunable to convey the knowledge and understanding that you have. Anyone trying to learn from you or from a book you have written must halve their Advancement Total (or Lab Total, if you are a magus and have written Lab Texts on some spells or enchanted items). If you are a magus teaching spells, halve all applicable Lab Totals, both yours and the student's.

<span id="inconstant-magic"></span>
==== Inconstant Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic The character's magic is easily distracted, and it stutters and starts. Spells that require his guidance (e.g. concentration, or aimed spells) after being cast are not immediately responsive, as if the character must focus the spell's attention, and spells that are triggered by a condition (such as Waiting Spells or enchanted devices) take about two minutes to activate, as if the magic had wandered off when the caster was not watching it carefully. Any magic items he creates with constant effects are interrupted at sunrise and sunset; the magic is not seamless. The character suffers a -3 penalty to all Finesse rolls.

<span id="independent-craftsman"></span>
==== Independent Craftsman ====

Minor, General This character has his own way of working and doesn't like other people getting in his way. This character always treats his Leadership and Craft or Profession Abilities as three levels lower when working with others on a given task. For Craftsmen, this means that whether he is working as an assistant or working with assistants his Craft Ability has a penalty of -3. This affects the number of assistants he can employ in the workshop and the benefit that he provides when working as an assistant. If you are not using the rules in City and Guild (page 73), treat this is a Personality Flaw.

<span id="indiscreet"></span>
==== Indiscreet ====

Major, Story You are unable to keep a secret. You must tell all to the first\ninterested party you meet in an\neffort to be helpful or to demonstrate that you are in-theknow, unless you succeed on an Intelligence-based stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If you botch, you may have to be physically restrained by your companions from answering any questions put to you for the remainder of the encounter.

<span id="infamous"></span>
==== Infamous ====

Minor, General People know you well and curse you in their prayers. You have a level 4 bad Reputation, specifying the horrible deeds that earned you such ill will.

<span id="infamous-master"></span>
==== Infamous Master ====

Minor, Hermetic Your master was a diabolist, bumbler, fool, widely despised, or held in contempt for some other reason. Most magi expect little better from you. Even if you've done nothing wrong, you are treated as though you don't deserve to be a member of the Order. You have a bad Reputation of the appropriate type at level 3 among magi.

<span id="inscribed-shadow"></span>
==== Inscribed Shadow ====

Minor, Subernatural The character's stigmata are reflected by glowing symbols in the character's shadow. This causes alarm among nonmagicians and makes the character's stigmata extremely easy for other Criamon magi to read (+3 on all rolls). The shadow's glowing symbols do not vanish when there is insufficient light to form a shadow — they burn brighter. Characters who use magic to hide their stigmata are not acting aptly. Only characters with stigmata may have this Flaw, which normally means that they must be magi of House Criamon.

<span id="jinxed"></span>
==== Jinxed ====

Minor, General The character is a magnet for any bad luck. He is not personally the cause of the bad luck, and so need not roll any extra botch dice or suffer any penalty to die rolls. However, whenever chance determines who will be affected by misfortune, the odds are biased against him to be the one affected. For example, if it has been determined that a rope used for climbing will break, it is more likely to do so when the jinxed character makes the climb. If determining when the bandits will attack the camp at night, it is more likely to happen right at the moment when the character is relieving himself. If the storyguide is rolling dice to determine the target of a random event, a jinxed character should be affected half of the time, and his comrades between them the other half. His bad luck does not tend to spill over onto others; in fact, other characters may prefer to keep him around to deflect any bad luck from themselves.

<span id="judged-unfairly"></span>
==== Judged Unfairly ====

Minor, General Somehow you come across the wrong way to people, and they universally distrust and underestimate you. You catch no one's eye, impress no one, and can get no one to take you seriously. If you ever find an

exceptional someone who sees you as you want to be seen, you will cling to that person. You cannot gain a positive Reputation in any community, and this Flaw is incompatible with any Virtue that gives you such a Reputation.

<span id="lame"></span>
==== Lame ====

Minor, General One of your legs is weakened, whether since birth or through some accident. You move slowly and clumsily. Your base speed is a mere one mile per hour, and anyone can outrun you. You suffer a -6 penalty on rolls involving moving quickly or

with agility, -3 on Dodge, and -1 on other combat scores.

<span id="lecherous"></span>
==== Lecherous ====

Major or Minor, Personality You seek sexual contact with as many people as possible. Note that you need not be any good at seduction; skill here merely changes the kinds of problems you encounter.

<span id="leprosy"></span>
==== Leprosy ====

Major, General The character has leprosy. A leper has a permanent -2 modifier to her Living Condition (with an additional -1 if she lives in a leper colony), and whenever she undergoes an Aging Crisis (page 392) the leper sustains a Heavy Wound in addition to any other result. Lepers cannot gain a positive Reputation due to a pungent rotting smell that they emit.

<span id="lesser-malediction"></span>
==== Lesser Malediction ====

Minor, Subernatural You have been cursed by some supernatural power. The effects of

the curse should be about as bad as other Minor General Flaws.

<span id="limited-magic-resistance"></span>
==== Limited Magic Resistance ====

Minor, Hermetic

You are less able to resist magic than other magi. You gain no bonus from one of your Form scores to Magic Resistance, though if you are caught without your Parma Magica, you retain a Magic Resistance of 0. You may take this Flaw multiple times, for multiple Forms.

<span id="lingering-injury"></span>
==== Lingering Injury ====

Minor, General

The character suffers from an old injury that won't heal properly, resulting in a -1 penalty to all rolls involving physical activity. If he botches a physical action, he aggravates the injury and the penalty becomes -3 (recovery from aggravation is as for a Light Wound). This condition worsens with age, so multiply whatever the penalty is by 1 + (Decrepitude Score).

<span id="loose-magic"></span>
==== Loose Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your Advancement Total is halved whenever you try to Master spells.

<span id="lost-love"></span>
==== Lost Love ====

Minor, Personality

You have lost your true love to death, distance, or marriage. You take little joy in life's pleasures and give up easily in the face of difficulty, since you've already lost the most important struggle. On those occasions when you forget yourself and have a good time, you inevitably feel sorrow afterwards, thinking about how it could have been if your love were with you.

<span id="low-self-esteem"></span>
==== Low Self-Esteem ====

Major, General

You have a deflated opinion of your own self-worth. You begin the game with no Confidence Score, and never have any Confidence Points.

<span id="low-tolerance"></span>
==== Low Tolerance ====

Minor, General

The character cannot easily withstand pain and fatigue. Increase the penalties for reduced Fatigue levels by one point, and increase the total penalty from wounds the character has received by one point. You also suffer a -3 penalty on rolls for the character to resist pain.

<span id="lycanthrope"></span>
==== Lycanthrope ====

Major, Supernatural

You have been cursed to change form into a dangerous predator (such as a wolf, lynx, or bear) on nights of the full moon (or similar, monthly, astrological events). No items or clothing transform between shapes, and it takes one full round for the full transformation to take effect. You are not immune to normal weapons, and the curse does not infect bite victims. The animal may be detected as a cursed human with an InAn or InCo spell.

You have the intelligence of an animal while changed, react to all stimuli as an animal, and do not retain any memory of actions taken in animal form, save occasionally in dreams. You may not even realize that you are under this curse. You can still recognize both friends and

enemies when changed. Lycanthropes may transform

into a non-magical animal between Size -1 (wolf) and Size +2 (bear). You have the normal physical characteristics of a shapeshifter (see page 107), except that +3 is added to your Soak score (in animal form only). Furthermore, you are fully healed of all wounds incurred in animal form upon resuming human form (which happens at dawn).

<span id="magic-addiction"></span>
==== Magic Addiction ====

Major, Hermetic

You crave the rush of casting and holding power over magic. Whenever you cast a spell, you have a difficult time stopping yourself from casting again and again until you drop from exhaustion. Whenever you use a stress die in spellcasting, you must, whether or not the spell

succeeds, make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll, against an Ease Factor of half the level of the spell (or, if you botched, the level you were attempting). If you fail, as your next action you must either cast a Formulaic spell of at least the same level as the previous spell, or cast any spontaneous spell, expending Fatigue and not reserving levels for Penetration. You must roll again to control your addiction, based on the level of the spell you just cast, but you get a +3 bonus to the roll for every spell you cast after the first. If you botch, you continue casting spells until you fall unconscious.

<span id="magical-air"></span>
==== Magical Air ====

Major, General

People and animals react to you as if you had The Gift. You may not take this Flaw if you actually do have The Gift; see The Blatant Gift (page 120) instead.

<span id="magical-being-companion"></span>
==== Magical (Being) Companion ====

Minor, Story

The character is accompanied by an intelligent magical being, one that is smart enough to follow orders or disobey them on its own initiative, which the character must regularly look after. This might be an animal, a spirit, a human-like creature, or even an animate object. Realms of Power: Magic contains extensive rules for designing such characters, but they can also be made following the guidelines and examples in Chapter 13 of this book. A grog-level character might be essentially an extension of the character's will, while a companion-level character might follow instructions but often do what it thinks is best, and a magus-level character might be condescending or wild, and rarely act except on its own initiative.

A particularly common example is a magical animal that's smart enough to follow your orders or to disobey them on its own initiative. The smaller and more innocuous the creature, the more intelligent it is. A ferret or crow is as intelligent as a human,

a wolf is very cunning, and an animal the size of a horse is simply more intelligent than normal. The creature has a Magic Might score of 10 – Size.

<span id="magical-fascination"></span>
==== Magical Fascination ====

Minor, Personality

This character is intensely interested in supernatural and magical phenomena, to the exclusion of all other motivations. It is as if his life is hollow and drab without these experiences. He will involve himself in any supernatural investigation, social encounter, or confrontation. He must try and find out as much as he can about it, and he is curious and has busy hands, definitely trying to take souvenirs. To represent the scraps of knowledge he has, he is allowed to have a score of 1 (but no more) in either Magic or Faerie Lore at character creation. But most of the time, he is filling in the blanks himself and making it up as he goes along, enthusiastically.

<span id="manifest-sin"></span>
==== Manifest Sin ====

Minor, Supernatural A sin or crime this character has committed in the past stains his spirit and is manifest to those who can perceive things hidden to mortal senses. Characters with Second Sight, Sense Holiness &amp; Unholiness, or similar Supernatural Powers or Abilities perceive the sin through one or more senses.

The manifestation of the sin or crime should be chosen by you and the storyguide together, and should always be appropriate to the sin or crime in question. For instance, the perpetrator of a violent crime may appear to have blood on his hands, or be accompanied by the sobbing of his victim, while lustful sins may be seen to play across the sinner's leering face.

In addition, the character suffer a -1 penalty to all social interaction rolls or totals as the intangible aura of their past sins affects those with whom they interact.

While his spirit is tainted and the manifestation will always be with him, he may spend a Faith Point, including Faith Points gained from taking Holy Communion and from relics, to banish the manifestation for Sun duration. While banished, the sin cannot be perceived and the social penalty is also suspended.

This Flaw originates from either the Divine or the Infernal Realm, as a mark of punishment, penitence, or temptation.

<span id="manufactured-ignorance"></span>
==== Manufactured Ignorance ====

Minor, Story, Tainted The tainted person has a delusion, but his mistaken belief is sustained by a group of minor demons that provide a stream of supporting evidence. Different groups of demons create varying delusions for tainted people. Many such people believe they have a glorious destiny, and the world smiles at their efforts, because the demons make it appear so. Hermetic demon hunters have found more than one child who believed he was the final scion of a noble house.

In each story, the character receives one minor, fortunate occurrence that confirms his rosy view of life. Minor fortunate occurrences are situations demons can arrange surreptitiously ahead of time. They may include a character arriving at an inn where the last room is available, finding an important door unlocked, or a coal from the fireplace mysteriously extinguishing itself on the floor rushes.

<span id="many-marriageable-daughters"></span>
==== Many Marriageable Daughters ====

Major, Story

The character has a lot of daughters and needs to participate in stories to marry them off suitably. In most sagas, this Flaw is most suitable for characters of high social status, as their stories are more likely to involve the covenant, and thus other characters.

<span id="master-of-none"></span>
==== Master of None ====

Minor, General

Either by choice or circumstance, this character never seems to be able to stick at a task or job for longer than a season, usually following the work as it moves through the year. As a result, this

character can't apply any experience points earned through an Advancement Total to an Ability or Art that they have already applied experience points to this year. Where they can't be applied to a different Ability or Art, the experience points are lost.

Experience points gained through other means, such as Secondary Insight, are unaffected and may be applied normally.

<span id="meddler"></span>
==== Meddler ====

Major or Minor, Personality You want to fix other peoples' lives: arrange matches, teach children to sew &quot;properly,&quot; or tend the sick. You waste a lot of time and energy on such endeavors, and people usually resent it.

<span id="mentor"></span>
==== Mentor ====

Minor, Story A person of some importance, wealth, or wisdom has taken an\ninterest in your life, and at times

provides you with minor material aid and advice. However, at some point your mentor will have a small favor or two to ask of you. He might not necessarily like your relationship with the covenant — perhaps you must keep it a secret. The Mentor must be an NPC.

<span id="missing-ear"></span>
==== Missing Ear ====

Minor, General You cannot accurately locate the direction of sounds, and suffer a penalty of -3 to hearing rolls.

<span id="missing-eye"></span>
==== Missing Eye ====

Minor, General You cannot judge close distances easily and get –3 on Attack rolls for missiles and targeting rolls for spells. In melee combat you suffer –1 on Attack rolls because your field of vision is limited. You also have a blind side from which people can approach unseen. This Flaw can be combined with Poor Eyesight, but the penalties are cumulative.

<span id="missing-hand"></span>
==== Missing Hand ====

Minor, General Perhaps it was an accident or a punishment in your past that cost you one of your hands. Climbing, combat, and other activities normally requiring both hands are at a penalty of -3 or greater.

<span id="mistaken-identity"></span>
==== Mistaken Identity ====

Major, Story Someone, who looks exactly like you and whom you and your companions will most likely never meet, lives near you, and is responsible for an ongoing variety of violent, illegal, obscene, or embarrassing acts. You often have to explain who you are, and sometimes have to deal with the consequences of the other person's acts.

<span id="monastic-vows"></span>
==== Monastic Vows ====

Major, Story You have taken vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to a religious superior. This covers the vows taken by mendicant friars, as well as those taken by monks and nuns strictly speaking.

<span id="monastic-vows-hermetic"></span>
==== Monastic Vows (Hermetic) ====

Major, Hermetic You have taken vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to a religious superior, which means that you cannot own vis and must only possess functional magic devices. You cannot marry, and many magi might\ninterpret that as prohibiting binding a familiar. You must do what your master commands in service of your order, though in return you can expect aid and assistance when needed.

<span id="monstrous-blood"></span>
==== Monstrous Blood ====

Minor, Supernatural The character's essential nature has been changed through exposure to the Magic realm, often because of a relationship to a magic being, which gives her true form unfortunate supernatural properties. This changes the character's appearance enough that others can immediately recognize that there is something wrong about her, and people might say that she has tainted blood. The character is more resistant to age and receives a -1 bonus to all Aging rolls, and may learn Magic Lore during character creation.

However, the character also gains a minor physical deformity appropriate to the Magic being type that is associated with the character's background. Some examples are below, or you can make up your own.

Magic Animal: The character has a physical feature normally associated with animals, such as wings, scales, gills, sharp teeth, or claws. These are not usable by the character, and give a –3 penalty to appropriate activities (such as running or climbing) as these deformities get in the way.

Magic Human: The character must decrease one of his

Characteristics by 1, but not below –3. This might be Strength or Stamina to represent weakened blood, or Presence to indicate a dowdy appearance. The character also has a poor Reputation of level 3 among other magic beings.

Magic Spirit: The character has a mental block against many activities that are not supernatural, possibly due to a noticeable difficulty with retaining memories. Subtract 3 from all of the character's Intelligence and Perception rolls that do not involve a Supernatural Ability or Art.

Magic Thing: The character has a constant Lesser Power that is mostly detrimental to it in some way, such as a ward that prevents it from picking up wooden objects, or that causes books it touches to burst into flame. The effect normally occurs involuntarily, but the character can spend a Confidence Point to prevent it from triggering.

<span id="motion-sickness"></span>
==== Motion Sickness ====

Minor, General Riding a horse, in a cart, or sailing on a ship makes you violently ill. When not traveling on foot, you suffer double the fatigue loss on long journeys, with a minimum loss of two Fatigue levels. Violent jostling over a period of a few hours could conceivably lead to unconsciousness.

<span id="mute"></span>
==== Mute ====

Major, General You cannot speak; perhaps your tongue was cut out. You probably use rudimentary hand gestures and grunts to communicate your needs. You can still understand languages perfectly well, and may learn to read and write if you have an appropriate Virtue. Note that magi with this Flaw get a -10 penalty to all spellcasting, although this may be offset by taking the Quiet Magic Virtue (page 105). A magus with this Flaw can be assumed to be able to make sounds, which are sufficient to allow normal use of the Voice Range.

<span id="necessary-condition"></span>
==== '''Necessary Condition''' ====

Major, Hermetic In order for your magic to work, you must perform a specific action while casting any spell. This should be something simple, such as singing or spinning around three times. If you cannot perform the action, you cannot cast spells at all.

<span id="necessary-realm-aura-for-ability"></span>
==== Necessary (Realm) Aura for (Ability) ====

Minor, Supernatural Due to some connection with a given supernatural realm, the absence of a given supernatural aura has a pronounced effect upon the character's ability to focus on certain tasks. The character has a -3 penalty to any totals he generates with a particular Ability when not in the right aura. A character may take this Flaw once for any particular Ability. The chosen Ability should be one which the character is likely to use frequently, such as in service to the covenant or to support his day-to-day activities.

When applied to Craft or Profession Abilities, this Flaw also reduces the character's capability to support himself by reducing the number of Labor Points (as described in City &amp; Guild) he accumulates each season when not working within the appropriate aura.

Troupes should think carefully about how a character would be limited by taking Magic (which covers most covenants) or Dominion (which covers most other human settlements) aura. If the character would not be limited, the Flaw should not be allowed.

<span id="night-terrors"></span>
==== Night Terrors ====

Minor, General This character is plagued far too often by horrible nightmares and fits of screaming in his sleep. The character must make a Stress Roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in order to avoid suffering terrors. The storyguide may call for modifiers of -1 to -3 if he has faced eerie or terrifying events recently, like meeting a demon or battling the undead.

Suffering from terrors means that the character wakes up often and in a panic during the night. Situations might occur where he overreacts or reacts in unfortunate ways, if forced awake during such nights. The morning leaves him with a Long Term Fatigue Level lost. These Long Term Fatigue Levels are cumulative, so several bad nights leave him in bad shape. Subtract the character's Fatigue penalty from the Ease Factor to avoid night terrors, to represent how a truly exhausted victim will at some point sleep through the nightmares due to sheer exhaustion. If a night of terrors renders the character Unconscious, he slips into deep, dreamless sleep. He sleeps for an entire day and night, and wakes up at Winded, ending the string of Night Terrors. A character with this Flaw may not also take the Sleep Disorder Flaw

This Flaw normally makes seasonal Laboratory work impossible, and so is not suitable for magi.

<span id="no-hands"></span>
==== No Hands ====

Major, General

You have no hands. Any activity requiring hands is impossible, and magi with this Flaw take a – 5 penalty to all Casting Scores. This may be offset by taking the Subtle Magic Virtue (page 110) or the Still Casting Spell Mastery ability.

<span id="no-sense-of-direction"></span>
==== No Sense of Direction ====

Minor, General You are completely unable to follow directions. North, south,\neast, and west have no meaning to you, and you often confuse right and left. You frequently get lost while traveling\nunfamiliar paths by yourself, or with others following your lead, and often have to reason your way home or to your destination from first principles. This Flaw\nis incompatible with the WellTraveled Virtue.

<span id="nocturnal"></span>
==== Nocturnal ====

Minor, General

Your natural body rhythms try to keep you sleeping until noon. You are at –1 on all rolls made between dawn and midday. Conversely, you have little difficulty staying up at night. Though you enjoy no special benefits in the dark, your companions may decide to saddle you with night guard duty on a regular basis to use your attributes to best effect.

<span id="noncombatant"></span>
==== Noncombatant ====

Minor, Personality You have no interest in combat, nor do you have any ability with it. You might be unreasonably afraid of combat, or a complete pacifist, or prone to freezing and doing nothing.

<span id="oath-of-fealty"></span>
==== Oath of Fealty ====

Major, Story

You have sworn an oath of loyalty and support to someone outside the covenant, and sometimes they call on you to uphold your vow. Magi are forbidden from taking Oaths of Fealty by the Hermetic Code. Some don't let that stop them.

<span id="obese"></span>
==== Obese ====

Minor, General

You are large because of fat, not muscle. You are at –1 to all rolls that involve moving quickly or gracefully and at –3 to all Fatigue rolls. You are not so large that your Size is increased, and you may take this Flaw along with the Virtues and Flaws that change your Size.

<span id="obsessed"></span>
==== Obsessed ====

Major or Minor, Personality You are fixated on some prized object, action, or ideal. This interferes with your accomplishment of more immediate tasks. Examples might include obsessive protection of magi to the point that you attack those who insult them, or obsessive neatness where you keep yourself spotless and deride those who do not.

<span id="offensive-to-beings"></span>
==== Offensive to (Beings) ====

Minor, Hermetic and General This Flaw is associated with one of six classes of beings: animals, mundane humans, divine beings, faeries, demons, or magical creatures. These last four include characters associated with the Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic realm, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Might.

Beings of the chosen category react badly to the character, as if he had The Gift, which makes them very uncomfortable around him and gives him a –3 to all social interaction rolls with them.

You may not take this Flaw more than once; characters who are Offensive to more than one kind of being should take Magical Air instead. Characters with The Gift may take this Flaw only if they have the Gentle Gift, which makes this type of being react to them negatively while others are unaffected. Characters with Magical Air may not take it at all.

If you are offensive to animals, animals with a Might score react in different ways. In general, those that react negatively to The Gift react negatively to you, while those that react positively do not, unless you actually have The Gift.

<span id="optimistic"></span>
==== '''Optimistic''' ====

Major or Minor, Personality You are convinced that\neverything will turn out for the best. This is not overconfidence, as you accept that you might well fail. Even if you do, however, you are sure that circumstances will mean that\neverything works to your benefit.

<span id="outcast"></span>
==== Outcast ====

Minor, Social Status You have the rough task of making it on your own—normal society rejects you and you are not attached to a covenant. Perhaps you have a magical nature, a supernatural background, some disfigurement, or a tremendous scandal in your past. You may not take the Wealthy Virtue.

<span id="outlaw"></span>
==== Outlaw ====

Major, Social Status You have been outlawed, and must live by your wits outside society. You may take Martial Abilities at character generation, and have a Reputation at level 2 for whatever got you outlawed. Outlaw followers created as grogs should take the Branded Criminal, Outcast or Wanderer social status.

<span id="outlaw-leader"></span>
==== Outlaw Leader ====

Minor, Social Status You command a small group (three to six persons) of outlaws. Your followers look up to you and do what you tell them within reason. However, you must occasionally stick up for the group or one of its members. as well as provide for them. You often have to deal with challenges to your leadership in one form or another. You are well known as an outlaw in the local area, with a Reputation level of 3. You are actively sought by the local lord, sheriff, or other such official. You may take Martial Abilities at character generation. Grogs may not take this Flaw.

<span id="outsider"></span>
==== Outsider ====

Minor or Major, Social Status You belong to a group that is both readily identifiable and distrusted or disliked. Examples in most of Europe include Jews, North Africans, and Arabs. For sagas set in Egypt, this Flaw is appropriate for Europeans.

If you live in society, take the Major version. You are shunned and often persecuted because of this, and your life and freedom may occasionally be in peril. You have a bad Reputation of level 1 to 3 (depending upon how easy it is to identify you) among members of the dominant social group of your area.

If you spend most of your life in a closed group, such as a city ghetto or covenant, where people like you are accepted, take the Minor version, as you are only shunned if you leave your home, and have somewhere relatively safe to run to if you

find trouble. You still have the bad Reputation among members of the dominant social group, but do not meet them so often.

As a general rule, companions should take the Major version of this Social Status, as they probably interact with wider society often enough for it to be a major problem. Grogs may take the Minor version.

If the saga takes the character to an area where they are a member of the dominant culture (an Egyptian who lives in a covenant in Ireland travels to Egypt, for example), the troupe should decide on a suitable Social Status for the character. This should normally be a Free Social Status Virtue, unless there are established facts in the character's background that suggest a different choice.

<span id="overconfident"></span>
==== Overconfident ====

Major or Minor, Personality You have a completely\nunshakable faith in your own abilities. You believe that you will always perform at, or slightly above, the peak of your abilities, and cannot imagine failure. If you actually botch, you come up with some rationalization as to what 'really' happened.

<span id="oversensitive"></span>
==== Oversensitive ====

Major or Minor, Personality Something that others find merely unpleasant you consider\nintolerable. Examples might\ninclude an oversensitivity to disrespect, to slovenliness, or to\nimpiety. If you are the violent type, you may start fights with those who offend you.

<span id="pagan"></span>
==== Pagan ====

Major or Minor, Personality You do not follow the teachings of the Church, and have never been baptized. This tends to\nupset those in authority in Mythic Europe and frighten common people who learn of it. You do not observe Christian holidays, and you try to avoid churchmen and the Dominion. You cannot pretend to go along with society, however, because you believe that it would

displease your gods and incur their wrath — you might suffer grave supernatural consequences if you take Communion or appear to worship gods other than your own. You may begin with Magic Lore or Faerie Lore, depending on the specifics of your faith. (This is not a Flaw in areas of Mythic Europe with substantial pagan populations, but by 1220 the only such areas are in parts of the Novgorod Tribunal. It may also be a Minor Flaw for grogs who live at a covenant with a substantial pagan population that is an accepted and open part of the covenant community.)

<span id="painful-magic"></span>
==== Painful Magic ====

Major, Hermetic Casting spells causes you to suffer the equivalent of one Fatigue level in pain for each spell you cast. This reduces all your actions by the appropriate Fatigue penalty, which is cumulative with any from actual fatigue or injuries (though you do not suffer any physical damage from pain). You recover these &quot;pain levels&quot; just like Fatigue levels.

<span id="palsied-hands"></span>
==== Palsied Hands ====

Minor, General Your hands shake\nuncontrollably, which makes casting spells or holding objects difficult. All rolls involving holding or wielding an object are made at -2, including weapon skills. Magi and others who rely on hand gestures to work magic must roll an extra botch die when casting a spell.

<span id="pessimistic"></span>
==== '''Pessimistic''' ====

Minor, Personality You always expect the worst. You may try to enjoy yourself, but you are sure that anything that can go wrong, will, and will pick on you.

<span id="pious"></span>
==== Pious ====

Major or Minor, Personality You are a fervent follower of your religion. You avoid the things it prohibits, and enthusiastically do the things it commands.

<span id="plagued-by-supernatural-entity"></span>
==== Plagued by Supernatural Entity ====

Major, Story Some supernatural being\ninterferes in your life on a fairly regular basis. It may even have your best interests at heart, but the result is that you get dragged into stories. Suitable\nexamples would be a demon trying to corrupt you, an angel trying to save you, a faerie playing games with you, or a ghost continuing the agenda she had while alive.

<span id="poor"></span>
==== Poor ====

Major, General

You are a poor member of your social class. You must work three seasons per year in order to make ends meet, and can afford only the necessities of life, as measured by your status. This also means that you have one fewer season available for any form of advancement other than exposure, which is a major hindrance. You cannot take this Flaw if you are supported by the covenant. In particular, this Flaw is not available to magi.

<span id="poor-characteristic"></span>
==== Poor (Characteristic) ====

Minor, General You have an exceedingly bad Characteristic — lower one which is already —3 or lower by one point. Describe what it is about you that makes this obvious, such as a feeble stature, hideous visage, or slack-jawed stupidity. You may take this Flaw twice for a single Characteristic, lowering it to —5, and multiple times for different Characteristics.

<span id="poor-concentration"></span>
==== Poor Concentration ====

Minor, General While the character may have a mind that is quick to make decisions, he has a short attention span. The character has a -3 penalty to Concentration rolls.

<span id="poor-eyesight"></span>
==== Poor Eyesight ====

Minor, General Bleary vision impedes your performance. Rolls involving sight, including rolls to attack and defend, are at –3. New\nenvironments are disorienting and perhaps frightening for you.

This Flaw can be combined with Missing Eye, but the penalties are cumulative.

<span id="poor-formulaic-magic"></span>
==== Poor Formulaic Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic You are simply not very good at Formulaic magic. Subtract 5 from every roll that you make to cast Formulaic spells. This does not apply to Ritual spells.

<span id="poor-hearing"></span>
==== Poor Hearing ====

Minor, General Subtract 3 from rolls involving hearing. Speech that is hard for others to understand because of language, dialect, or accent is almost impossible for you to follow. You often pretend to be listening to people when in fact you are not.

<span id="poor-living-conditions"></span>
==== Poor Living Conditions ====

Minor, General Either because of this character's own poor living conditions, or those of people he is in frequent contact with, he is more susceptible to the rigors of daily life. The character has an additional –1 Living Conditions Modifier. This is cumulative with the character's base Living Conditions Modifier.

<span id="poor-memory"></span>
==== Poor Memory ====

Minor, Personality You have a very hard time recalling one type of thing, such as names, faces, or places.

<span id="poor-student"></span>
==== Poor Student ====

Minor, General You are bad at learning new things. Subtract 3 from all Advancement Totals derived from teaching and books (that is, you have no penalty to adventure experience, exposure, practice, studying from vis, or training), but do not reduce a total below one. If you could learn something without this Flaw, you still learn a bit.

<span id="primitive-equipment"></span>
==== Primitive Equipment ====

Minor, General The character is capable of\nusing only the simplest tools and equipment. Perhaps her training was incomplete, or she has been affected by some sort

of curse, or maybe she originates from a less technologicallycapable society and refuses to adapt. She is restricted to Inexpensive weapons and armor only, regardless of what is made available to her. If forced by order or necessity to use other equipment, her Burden is one point higher when she uses anything other than Inexpensive weapons, and one point higher when she uses anything other than Inexpensive armor. She suffers a -1 penalty to Attack and Defense if using inappropriate weapons, and a -1 penalty to Initiative and Protection if using inappropriate armor. If the character works as a laborer or craftsman, she uses simple tools and primitive procedures. Unless working with simple tasks, the base Craft Value (see City &amp; Guild, page 67) is raised by 1-3 at the storyguide's discretion, based on complexity. Further, her workshop may not be improved with regards to Innovation (City &amp; Guild, page 65). Other Profession Abilities dependent on tools and equipment suffer a similar penalty for complex tasks. You should only take this Flaw if the character belongs to a profession that relies heavily on equipment, such as a smith, mason, or soldier.

<span id="primogeniture-lineage"></span>
==== Primogeniture Lineage ====

Minor, Story and Hermetic The character is in line for Primus of House Verditius. Either her parens, or her parens's parens, is the Primus, and she is one of his descendants. She is at least three places removed from the Primus. She receives undue attention from the House, as they eye her as a prospective Primus. The other magi in the same line may also regard her poorly, hoping to somehow remove her from her heritage. Her ascension to Primus is far from guaranteed, and many events may transpire to prevent her from claiming the title. This should foster very political stories for her. This Flaw can only be taken by magi of House Verditius, as a maga who has left the House is no longer a candidate for

Primus. In her case, it would be no more than an interesting feature of her background.

<span id="prohibition"></span>
==== Prohibition ====

Minor, Supernatural You have had a Conditional Curse (also known as a &quot;Geas&quot;) cast upon you and must obey the restrictions of your prohibition or be penalized by the curse. If you fail to adhere to the restrictions, you will suffer the curse in full force. The troupe must agree on both the restriction, and the curse that strikes you if you break it.

<span id="proud"></span>
==== Proud ====

Major or Minor, Personality You believe that you are more important than just about everybody, and expect the appropriate respect. Magi may admit one or two equals, but do not believe that they have any superiors. Mundanes will admit social superiors, but still believe themselves to be fundamentally better than, say, the king.

<span id="raised-from-the-dead"></span>
==== Raised from the Dead ====

Major, Story, Supernatural You died, and were brought back to life through a holy miracle. You begin with at least three Warping points, plus one Warping point for every year that has passed since you were resurrected, and you automatically receive another Warping point every year you continue living. You also have a level 4 reputation in the area where the miracle occurred. You do not remember what happened to you while you were dead, although you may have virtuous impulses that you cannot explain.

<span id="raised-in-the-gutter"></span>
==== Raised in the Gutter ====

Minor, General This character was raised on the margins of society. She is able to use her social abilities normally with those of the lower and middle classes, but doesn't know how to act among her &quot;betters.&quot; When using Charm or Guile, it is obvious that she's from the bad part of town, and this makes convincing people to do what she wants harder (–3 on rolls). She can use Etiquette normally if she's holding her social place

(which means staying silent and

doing exactly what she's told)

but suffers a -3 penalty if she

(Realm) Stigmatic

tries to go beyond this.

Minor, Supernatural The character occasionally manifests physical phenomena in the presence of supernatural powers. Pick one of the four Realms of Power; whenever he enters an aura of strength 4 or more aligned to that realm, or is affected by a power greater than fourth magnitude (20th level) from that realm, he suffers from the stigmata. Every individual suffers from stigmata differently, but the most common variants are dark marks appearing on the skin, blood issuing from orifices, spontaneous eruption of wounds, minor twisting of the limbs, or the acquisition of minor animal features. Whenever they manifest, the character loses a Long-Term

Fatigue level that he cannot

recover while he remains under

influence of that Realm. When he recovers the Fatigue level, the stigmata fade. If he ever takes a Warping point from exposure to his sensitive Realm, his stigmata erupt so violently that he takes a Light Wound as well as Fatigue, and the stigmata remain until he recovers from this wound.

the

<span id="rebellious"></span>
==== Rebellious ====

Major or Minor, Personality You react adversely to any attempt to impose authority over you, and work against those who are in command. You do not necessarily have any desire to be a leader yourself, but you don't like to be pushed around.

<span id="reckless"></span>
==== Reckless ====

Major or Minor, Personality You tend not to notice that situations are threatening, and certainly do not stop to consider whether they might be. You just go ahead and charge right in.

<span id="reclusive"></span>
==== Reclusive ====

Minor, Personality You do not like being disturbed or interrupted. You feel that an intrusion by another upon your time is unnecessary at best, and an insult at worst. You are very reluctant to be dragged into public places, or group activities, and generally complain when you must participate. Note that this is often a bad Flaw for a player character, unless there is a good reason why that character needs to stay out of play most of the time (for example, he is played by the alpha storyguide).

<span id="rectorproctor"></span>
==== Rector/Proctor ====

Major, Story The character is the representative leader of his faculty or nation at a university,

depending on whether he is a master or a student. He is responsible for his colleagues' behavior and is obliged to deal with their academic concerns. The character must have a Social Status Virtue dictating his place within the university. The character can expect to spend considerable time sorting out his fellows' affairs.

<span id="regular"></span>
==== Regular ====

Minor, General The character lives according to a strict religious rule, which leaves little time for other activities. The character must spend one of his free seasons on the seasonal activity of worship. This is particularly suitable for monk and canon characters, but it is not compulsory. The Regular Flaw is compatible with Wealthy and Poor, but a Poor Regular character effectively has no free seasons and may be unsuitable as a player character. Magi can be Regular.

<span id="repellent"></span>
==== Repellent ====

Major, General, Tainted The character has developed one of the physical characteristics of his demonic creator, which causes fear and revulsion among normal humans. The character makes all rolls requiring trust with a -6 penalty. The character also gains a minor advantage from the repellent feature. As examples, a character with horns, claws, or fangs could learn to use them in melee, a scaled character might have a Soak bonus of +3, and a character with demonic eves might see in the dark.

<span id="restricted-learning"></span>
==== Restricted Learning ====

Minor, General The character is incapable of learning new things without assistance. Pick five Abilities at character creation, you can only apply experience points to these Abilities. The character cannot learn any new Abilities on her own, she must receive experience points from Teaching or Training to develop a new Ability or to improve one that is not part of the initial five. Furthermore, she cannot use an

Ability with no score, even if it can normally be used untrained. Any Supernatural Abilities from Virtues she possesses are added to the list of Abilities to which she can apply experience points. All mundane animals are required to take this Flaw. A character with Intelligence rather than Cunning is not a mundane animal for these purposes.

<span id="restricted-power"></span>
==== Restricted Power ====

Minor, Supernatural This Flaw limits the use of a supernatural power that can normally be used at will, such as those granted by the Focus Power, Greater Power, Lesser Power, Personal Power, and Ritual Power Virtues. The character must perform some special ceremony to activate it, such as drawing symbols on the ground or gesturing and chanting like a magus, or else the power only functions on a limited class of targets (such as men, wolves, sounds, or sand) or in specific circumstances (like at night, under water, when touching iron, or after singing a song). This Flaw may be taken once for each power the character possesses.

<span id="restriction"></span>
==== Restriction ====

Major, Hermetic

You cannot cast spells at all under certain uncommon conditions. These might refer to your state, such as touching the earth directly or having no beard, or to the target, such as birds or glass, or to your location when you use the magic, such as on a small boat or in a storm. The Restriction also applies to effects generated by any enchanted items you create. Spells cast remain in effect even if the Restriction comes into play. Thus, if your Restriction is that you must not have a beard, you cast a spell with Year duration, and then grow a beard, the spell does not fail.

<span id="rigid-magic"></span>
==== Rigid Magic ====

Major, Hermetic

You cannot use vis when you cast spells. Thus, you cannot increase your spell rolls or cast Ritual magic. You can use vis in the laboratory, or to refresh a Longevity Ritual.

<span id="rolling-stone"></span>
==== Rolling Stone ====

Minor, General

The rolling stone gathers no moss, and neither does this character. She has moved from village to village so often that she finds it difficult to create attachments in the community. All social rolls have a –1 penalty within the community.

<span id="savantism"></span>
==== Savantism ====

Minor, General The character's family was cursed by faeries; his mother tripped over a hare while pregnant with him, or he was born on horseback. He is physically capable, but simpleminded and slow-witted. He has half the standard experience points at character generation, all future Advancement Totals are halved, and he may not begin with an Ability above 3. However, with one favored Ability, he is exceptionally gifted. This Ability can improve normally, is limited to a score of 6 as a starting character, and has +3 to all rolls related to its specialization rather than just +1. The Ability must be something he could reasonably have access to learn; there would need to be an extraordinary background story for a savant who is a master of the longsword!

Most savants will be like the tragic fool whose precocious skill with horses has gone forever unnoticed, but some may have more esoteric talents. If the favored Ability requires a Virtue, such as Academic or Martial Abilities, then he must have that Virtue as normal; a mathematical savant would need a Virtue such as Educated to learn Artes Liberales. Magi may well desire the company of certain specialists: a Jerbiton maga would appreciate an artistic savant, for example. Similarly, a Failed Apprentice may have been left stricken with savantism when his Gift abandoned him, but he retained remarkable clarity on the Code of Hermes, becoming a valued clerk to a Quaesitor.

<span id="secretive"></span>
==== Secretive ====

Minor, Personality The character is prone to keeping secrets from his sodales. He rarely explains what he is doing or why he is doing it, which can frustrate those around him.

<span id="seeker"></span>
==== Seeker ====

Minor, Personality You are a self-proclaimed member of the Seekers, a loose organization of competitive magi searching for ancient magic and arcane artifacts. Much of your life is spent in pursuit of these items. Your\ninterests may occasionally clash with other interests of your House or covenant. More details about the Seekers can be found on page 15 of Houses of Hermes: True Lineages.

<span id="servant-of-the-land"></span>
==== Servant of the (Land) ====

Major, Story Some powerful magical creature has saved the character from death or granted a similar boon, and in return the character has been set a task. Possible tasks include: preaching a message, operating a lighthouse, or preventing hunting in a certain area. Usually the task is either difficult or time-consuming, and while it remains incomplete the character has the Minor Personality Flaw: Prohibition, but this does not count toward the character's total number of Virtues and Flaws. The Prohibition means that if the character does not spend at least one complete season every year working toward his assigned task, a curse afflicts him. Possible curses include: a magical compulsion to return to the land where the character must explain himself to his master, turning into an animal, or acquiring a Supernatural Flaw.

<span id="sheltered-upbringing"></span>
==== Sheltered Upbringing ====

Minor, Personality You grew up completely separated from society, knowing only your parents or mentor. Recently you have been

introduced to a wondrous new world of strangers, and you are overwhelmed. Depending on your personality, you might react with contempt, fear, or wonder. You are unable to function normally because you cannot understand most human customs. You may not take Bargain, Charm, Etiquette, Folk Ken, Guile, Intrigue, or Leadership as beginning Abilities, but you may learn them in play.

<span id="short-attention-span"></span>
==== '''Short Attention Span''' ====

Minor, Personality You have trouble concentrating. Keeping watch, listening to complex orders, following the plot of a story, or performing\nother such tasks that require continued attention are usually not within your ability.

<span id="short-lived-magic"></span>
==== Short-Lived Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic Your spells do not last as long as they should. Spells that should last a year, last a moon; those of a moon, only to the next sunrise or sundown; and those of a sun, merely Diameter. Diameter, Concentration, Ring, and Momentary spells are not affected.

<span id="short-of-breath"></span>
==== Short of Breath ====

Minor, General The character cannot last as long as others when exerting himself and quickly tires during extended physical activity. He receives a —3 penalty to all Stamina rolls to avoid fatigue, including rolls to maintain Concentration.

<span id="short-ranged-magic"></span>
==== Short-Ranged Magic ====

Major, Hermetic Halve your Casting Totals whenever you are not touching the target of the spell. Halve your Lab Total when designing an effect or spell that has a range greater than Touch,\nincluding Eye.

<span id="simple-minded"></span>
==== Simple-Minded ====

Minor, Personality You can only think about one thing at a time — guarding the bridge, hunting for a missing ring, or hiding in the trees for example. You become easily confused unless others give you very clear instructions. When unexpected circumstances pop up, you find them difficult to deal with.

<span id="sleep-disorder"></span>
==== Sleep Disorder ====

Minor, General More often than not, this character is unable to sleep soundly during the night. The resulting deprivation means that he is likely to nod off in periods of quiet and boredom. When the character is alone, comfortable, bored, or otherwise at risk of falling asleep, he needs to make a suitable Personality roll to avoid nodding off. Loyal, Reliable, and Lazy (for a penalty in the last case) are all appropriate. The character's current Fatigue penalty applies to the roll.

Regardless of whether he manages to stay awake, the following night you must make a stress roll (no botch) against an Ease Factor of 6 to see if the character sleeps well. Every night he has slept poorly, he loses a Long Term Fatigue Level. Continue this until he sleeps soundly for a whole night. Once he has lost 3 Long Term Fatigue Levels, he automatically sleeps through the night, due to sheer exhaustion. This Flaw is not compatible with the Night Terrors Flaw.

<span id="slothful"></span>
==== Slothful ====

Minor, Personality The character is lazy and indolent, and enjoys nothing better than doing as little as possible. He is very good at coming up with excuses as to why things need not be done right now. When roused into action, he works as hard as any other, but is constantly looking for opportunities to lapse into sloth again.

<span id="slow-caster"></span>
==== Slow Caster ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your magic requires more time to prepare and execute than that of other magi. Your Formulaic spells take two rounds to cast; Spontaneous spells also take two rounds unless you fast-cast, in which case they take one round casting time. Fast-cast Mastered spells also take the normal oneround time. You can still cast Muto Vim spells on your own spells, but the casting process takes longer. Ritual spells and ceremonial castings are performed as normal, since all magi must cast them slowly and carefully.

<span id="slow-power"></span>
==== Slow Power ====

Minor, Supernatural One of the character's supernatural powers is very slow, so that it requires an additional round of preparation to activate. This Flaw may be taken more than once, if the character has multiple powers, but not more than once for a single power.

<span id="slow-reflexes"></span>
==== Slow Reflexes ====

Minor, General The character does not react well to surprises. He receives a –3 to his Initiative total in situations warranting a quick response.

<span id="small-frame"></span>
==== Small Frame ====

Minor, General You are of a lighter-thanaverage build. Your Size is reduced to -1. This means that the severity of wounds you take\nincreases in four point\nincrements, rather than five point. (See page 404). You cannot take this Flaw and Giant Blood (page 83), Large (page 89), or Dwarf (page 126).

<span id="social-handicap"></span>
==== Social Handicap ====

Minor, General

You have some trait that keeps you from interacting easily with other people. This impairs your dealings with most of society, causing penalties of –3 on appropriate rolls. Examples include morose temperament, unworldliness, an unpleasant odor, or tactlessness.

<span id="soft-hearted"></span>
==== Soft-Hearted ====

Minor, Personality You cannot bear to witness suffering, and causing it brings you sleepless nights. Even the deaths of enemies are painful for you. You avoid danger and try to keep your friends out of it as well. Life and health mean so much that you would rather give up important goals than let another person risk combat. You are easily moved by song and story.

<span id="spontaneous-casting-tools"></span>
=== Spontaneous Casting Tools ===

Minor, Hermetic

The character must use casting tools to cast spontaneous spells just as he does for casting formulaic spells. He has 15 individual tools, one for each Art, which he must use in various combinations to cast spontaneous spells. This Flaw can only be taken by Verditius magi.

<span id="stigmatic-catalyst"></span>
==== Stigmatic Catalyst ====

Minor, Supernatural The character's presence sometimes causes symbolic marks to appear on the bodies of people without Magic Resistance nearby. The character cannot control this process, but may make Intelligence + Enigmatic Wisdom rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 to tell those so afflicted what form of spiritual purification they must undergo for the stigma to disappear. Characters who are stigmatized may have a hostile reaction if they realize the source of the stigmata. This Flaw is normally found among magi of House Criamon, and magi of that House would be interested in any other character who manifested it.

<span id="stockade-parma-magica"></span>
==== Stockade Parma Magica ====

Minor, Hermetic

Because of your restricted understanding of Parma Magica, you cannot suppress your Parma once it is erected. Any friendly spell or magical effect must penetrate your Parma Magica to affect you, just as if it were a hostile spell.

<span id="stuck-in-your-ways"></span>
==== Stuck in Your Ways ====

Minor, General Having come from a covenant, this character knows how things must be done to best serve the needs of covenfolk and magi alike. Only, his new home does things differently. And they're wrong. When making Stress Rolls against his Profession Abilities or any Ability concerning his new covenant, such as Leadership or Folk Ken, this character uses the lower of that Ability score and his current Covenant Lore Ability for his current covenant. Note that bonuses from Puissant or other Virtues still apply to the roll.

This Flaw can also be applied to organizations other than covenants, such as abbeys, universities, guilds, or churches.

<span id="study-requirement"></span>
==== Study Requirement ====

Major, Hermetic

You are unable to study magic from books or vis alone. You must study in the presence of the appropriate Art. For example, you need to sit next to a brook or pond to study Aquam, or a large fire to study Ignem. Growing things are good for Creo, decaying ones good for Perdo. As your knowledge grows, you need to work with larger and larger quantities. See the Study Bonus Virtue on page 110 for a list of examples.

You may take both Study Bonus and Study Requirement.

<span id="supernatural-nuisance"></span>
==== Supernatural Nuisance ====

Major, Story

Supernatural entities of a certain kind interfere in your life in minor ways whenever you are around them. This differs from Plagued by Supernatural Entity in that the nuisances do not have any long-term plans. This could represent a ghost that haunts you, or general enmity from faeries towards you.

Suppressed Gift

Major, Hermetic, Story The character has The Gift but cannot access its power, having temporarily lost his magical ability through mishap or some other misfortune. While the Gift is suppressed, the character cannot perform Hermetic magic, improve his Arts, or perform the Parma Magica. His Arts do provide him with Magic Resistance and he continues to suffer the negative social penalties of The Gift. Such a character may still use Supernatural Virtues and Abilities. He may be a member of the Order of Hermes, depending on when his Gift was suppressed.

How The Gift returns should be decided by the storyguide. Examples are surviving a laboratory disaster while assisting another magus (perhaps that was how Suppressed Gift was gained), comprehending a Temporary Twilight while in a powerful regio, visiting the Magic Realm and succeeding in some task, or undergoing a year's instruction from an elder dragon.

The troupe should consider carefully how the character will fit into the saga. If he replaces a player's magus, he has a very serious Flaw. If he replaces a companion, he will become much more powerful when the Story Flaw is resolved. Either approach can work, with care.

Surgical Empiricus

Minor, Social Status You are a chirurgeon by trade, but have never received a wide grounding in the subject; rather your training has focused on only a single aspect of Chirurgy. Pick a type of surgery as your specialization in that Ability (couching cataracts, removal of stones, bone-setting, etc.). When performing this type of surgery, you get the usual +1 bonus to your roll, but when trying to employ any other application of Chirurgy, you must halve your score in Chirurgy due to your inexperience. It is likely that you travel to get enough clientele for your practice, but can usually earn a good living.

Susceptibility to Divine Power Minor, Hermetic

You are especially sensitive to the Dominion and suffer twice the normal penalties (such as spellcasting modifiers and botch dice) to your magic when in a Divine aura.

Susceptibility to Faerie Power

Minor, Hermetic

You are especially susceptible to the fay and their magic. Whenever you enter a Faerie aura, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than its aura rating to avoid becoming disoriented. In addition, your Magic Resistance score, including Parma Magica, against faerie effects is halved. If someone else uses their Parma Magica to protect you, their resistance is not affected and you benefit normally.

<span id="susceptibility-to-infernal-power"></span>
==== Susceptibility to Infernal Power ====

Minor, Hermetic You are especially vulnerable to the dark powers. Whenever you\nenter an area of Infernal\ninfluence, you must make a Stamina roll equal to or greater than the aura rating or become\nill (-1 on all rolls). You get only half your normal Magic Resistance score against infernal\neffects, though if someone else's Parma Magica is protecting you,\nit counts normally.

Susceptibility to Sunlight

Minor, Supernatural Direct, bright sunlight causes you noticeable pain and\nexhausts you. Attuned to darkness, your eyes are very sensitive, and you suffer from a -2 penalty to all rolls involving sight in bright environments such as a cloudless day. Due to your malediction, you lose one Fatigue level per Diameter if outdoors at noon on a hot summer day, and lose levels more slowly in less-intense light and warmth from the sun.

Susceptibility to Warping

Minor, Supernatural Your character's constant\nexposure to magic has made him more susceptible to

supernatural Warping than he might otherwise be.

In any year in which the character gains a Warping Point from any Realm or any source (including Longevity Rituals, living within an aura, and powerful supernatural effects), the character gains one additional Warping Point associated with that same Realm. This means that if he gains a single Warping Point from each Realm in a year, he gains four additional Warping Points, one from each Realm, at the end of that year.

These additional points do not contribute to Wizard's Twilight or to other events caused by the acquisition of Warping Points as they accrete slowly over the course of the year.

Tainted Offspring

Major, Story, Tainted The character has a child who has been marked for great, but unpleasant, things by a powerful demon. The character must struggle not only with the servants the demon sends to subvert the child, but the child's own tendency toward evil.

<span id="tainted-with-evil"></span>
==== Tainted With Evil ====

Minor, General An air of corruption surrounds you as a result of something you, your parents, or your ancestors did. Others naturally feel very ill at ease around you, and can\neasily grow to hate you. Gaining a positive Reputation is\nimpossible. Magi do not react as strongly to this attribute as normal people.

<span id="temperate"></span>
==== Temperate ====

Minor, Personality You do not over-indulge in any sensual pleasures.

Tormenting Master

Major, Story Your master does not believe you have successfully passed the apprentice's gauntlet (the test of becoming a magus). He periodically troubles you with political moves and indirect attacks. This Flaw is only applicable to magi, although\nother characters could take an analogous Story Flaw.

Tragic Life

Major, Story, Tainted The character's life has been manipulated by demons to ensure that she will act in a certain way in response to important events, usually to her own detriment and in such a way as to further a particular demon's aims. This means that she is a tainted character.

Tainted characters are produced as tools, to influence pivotal events. This Flaw represents two factors: the events that the demons have designed the person to influence are likely to happen, and the person has been designed and conditioned to behave predictably when her moment of destiny arrives. Tainted people are likely, at their point of destiny, to choose to sin, and so cause terrible events. The repercussions of the tragedy they create often harm the tainted person. The predisposition toward sin at the character's pivotal moment should be represented with a sinful Personality Trait.

Tainted people have difficult lives, but are not doomed from the moment of their conception. They have five sources of hope.

* Demons do not foresee the future, they simply predict it through extremely skilled judgments. Arbitrary occurrences can ruin their schemes.
* The process of creating and training tainted people contains random factors. These include inherited Flaws, like Tainted with Evil or Disfigured, which are personally painful, but might distance the character from her designed destiny.
* The character's relationships with other humans also provide unpredictable elements. Most significantly, virtuous humans may notice the tainted person's tendency toward a certain type of sin, and teach them to resist it.
* Humans have free will. All deception aside, the tainted person still has the power to choose not to perform sins. The tainted person may not understand this, or may feel that the sin she performed is minor and justified given the situation in which she is presented with her choice, but the choice is still entirely and absolutely hers.

Finally, the agents of the Divine meddle in the plans of Infernal lords.

Tainted characters are designed for specific situations. Characters who struggle successfully against their destiny find that their creator cannot usually fashion an alternative situation to which the tainted person is perfectly suited. The tainted character loses the Tragic Life Flaw, but usually gains the Plagued by Supernatural Entity Flaw instead, as the demonic lord vents his spite on the character.

<span id="true-love"></span>
==== True Love ====

Major or Minor, Story You have found the one person meant for you in all of creation. and the bond between the two of you cannot be sundered. Whenever you are suffering, in danger, or dejected, the thought of your love will give you strength to persevere. In dire need, he may even come to rescue vou. More often, he will be in trouble and need rescuing. If any enchantment keeps you from your true love's side, the power of your devotion can probably break it. Your love is higher than mortal magic, and no magic can make you hate your love, or make you truly betray him. Your True Love must be a non-player character. To have another player character as your True Love, see the True Love Virtue on page 113.

This Story Hook may be renamed 'True Friend' to cover characters with whom you are very closely linked, but not in a romantic way.

If the True Love is significantly weaker than the player character, and not able to provide useful assistance in most cases, this is a Major Flaw. If the True Love is competent, equal to or better than the player character, then this is only a Minor Flaw. The True Love may need rescuing occasionally, but more often she will involve the player character in her plans.

<span id="twilight-prone"></span>
==== Twilight Prone ====

Major, Hermetic You either enjoy or cannot help running excessive amounts of magic through you when you cast spells. You must roll to resist Twilight on a single magical botch, rather than on a double botch like most magi.

<span id="tzadik-nistar"></span>
==== Tzadik Nistar ====

Major, Story Your character is one of the Tzadikim Nistarim, one of the 36 hidden righteous upon which the continuation of the world relies. She is destined to face a moment of moral decision, where she and the world through her will be tested. This moment could be small and personal, or it require a very public act. The result of failing in her test has immediate consequences defined by the storyguide. The Dominion may fall in her community or in the place of her moral failure; the Infernal may claim a new soul; or a whole region may face severe hardship until she puts right her failure. Although this is a Jewish tradition, a character need not be Jewish to take this Flaw. She may suspect that she has been chosen as one of the 36, but she does not know in advance what her personal test will be, though it may be discovered by consulting with prophets and learned men.

<span id="unbaptized"></span>
==== Unbaptized ====

Major, Story You are a Christian who has never been baptized for whatever reason, perhaps because you have some kind of supernatural background that might be undone by the ceremony — many magi believe that baptism impairs The Gift. Your faith is important enough to you that you still strive to be virtuous and attend Mass, though you do not benefit from the sacraments. Most common people who discover this fear and avoid you.

<span id="unbearable-to-beings"></span>
==== Unbearable to (Beings) ====

Minor, Hermetic or General This Flaw is associated with one of three classes of beings: mundane humans, demons, or divine beings. These last two include characters associated with the Divine or the Infernal realms, respectively, through Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as well as beings with Divine or Infernal Might.

These beings are extremely disturbed, frightened, and possibly enraged by the character's presence. She suffers an additional –3 penalty on all social interactions with them, which adds to the –3 penalty normally associated with The Gift. Only characters with The Gift or Magical Air may take this Flaw, and it cannot be combined with the Blatant Gift.

You may not take this Flaw more than once; characters who are Unbearable to more than one kind of being should take the Blatant Gift instead.

<span id="uncertain-faith"></span>
==== Uncertain Faith ====

Minor, General Whether through a flaw in the character's understanding of doctrine, a moral turmoil, the disheartening absolution of repeated sins, or exposure to conflicting philosophies, he finds it hard to fully express devotion to his faith. Some element of doubt stands between him and the Divine, and all rolls for holy influence, tempering an aura, invoking God's aid, or invoking a saint or baraka (see Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, pages 38-41, 87, and 103) suffer a-3 penalty.

The character also has an &quot;Uncertain Faith&quot; Personality Trait at +1 that describes this conflict or doubt, which always provides demons with an opportunity to sow further doubt through their Obsession power (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 31).

Supernatural Abilities originating from the Divine, including Methods and Powers, are not penalized. This Flaw is not compatible with the True Faith Virtue.

<span id="uncontrollable-strength"></span>
==== Uncontrollable Strength ====

Minor, General

This character doesn't know his own strength, and at times he has trouble controlling it. This Flaw may not be taken if the character's Strength is below 0. Whenever he handles delicate or fragile objects, whenever care must be taken to knock somebody out gently, and so on, he risks overdoing it, severely. The character must make a stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to avoid using too much power and causing damage of some kind. In addition to this, any Strength Stress Roll uses one extra botch die.

<span id="unhappily-married"></span>
==== '''Unhappily Married''' ====

Major, Story

Young merchants often marry for financial reasons. The nobility are often required to marry to form or strengthen alliances. The character has married for money or politics, not love, and seeks solace outside his marital bed. Unhappily married characters must hide their affairs of the heart from their spouses, their spouses' families, and possibly from their partners' spouses. In many areas, separation due to infidelity is permitted, although this is not divorce. In many such cases the wife's dowry must be returned, in part or full. In the case of the nobility, this could even lead to a small, local war, or a Feud.

<span id="unimaginative-learner"></span>
==== Unimaginative Learner ====

Minor, Hermetic You have trouble figuring things out for yourself. Subtract 3 from rolls when you study from raw vis.

<span id="uninspirational"></span>
==== Uninspirational ====

Minor, General This character is bland, boring, and simple, with almost no chance of ever getting noticed or enticing anyone. His Presence and Communication may not be greater than 0. Any use of Abilities like Leadership, Charm, Intrigue, Etiquette or similar — as well as Personality Rolls — to stir or impress people suffers a — 3 penalty.

<span id="university-dean"></span>
==== University Dean ====

Major, Story The character is the head of a university, having already acquired his doctor in (faculty) license. The character has been chosen to lead the university. overseeing external affairs with the town and internal affairs between students and masters. Though prestigious, the position imposes serious demands on the character's time. The character can expect many interruptions in his teaching during the school year. The character must have the Virtue Doctor in (Faculty), be at least 40 years old, and can not have the Poor Flaw or any other Flaw that grants a Bad Reputation.

<span id="unlucky"></span>
==== Unlucky ====

Minor, General The character is exceptionally unlucky, and is frequently dealt a bad hand by the forces of chance. He gets a -1 to -3 penalty (at storyguide's discretion) on rolls in situations based on luck rather than skill or talent, depending on how much luck is involved. It would be wise for him not to take part in games of chance.

<span id="unnatural-magic"></span>
==== Unnatural Magic ====

Major, Hermetic Because of the unreal and illusory nature of your

magic, none of the character's Creo rituals have a permanent effect. Wounds magically closed with The Chirurgeon's Healing Touch (CrCo20), for example, reopen again as soon as he finishes casting the spell, as the magic truly lasts only a moment. He also cannot extract vis from an aura using Creo, since his version of that Art is too unstable for the vis to remain in a lasting physical form.

<span id="unpredictable-magic"></span>
==== Unpredictable Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

You always roll a stress die when using magic, even if completely relaxed. If you choose to cast a Spontaneous spell without expending fatigue, you must still roll to check for a botch, although the roll does not add to your Casting Total. Even if you have Mastered a spell, you must always roll at least one botch die.

<span id="unruly-air"></span>
==== '''Unruly Air''' ====

Minor, Supernatural The character has a penchant for stirring up situations, making pleasant events better and\nunpleasant ones worse. Whenever the character is in a social situation with multiple people, his slightest behavior will subtly push others to\nextreme behavior. He is either the life of the party, or its

mood of the crowd. His influence is linked to his magical nature, so that others with Magic Resistance are not influenced by him.

<span id="unspecialized"></span>
==== Unspecialized ====

Minor, General

The character does not have any specialties for any of her Abilities.

<span id="unstructured-caster"></span>
==== '''Unstructured Caster''' ====

Major, Hermetic You have never quite mastered the intricacies of spellcasting, and are unable to perform Formulaic magic without\nextreme effort. You cast all Formulaic spells as though they were Ritual spells (including the need for vis), and you may not learn Ritual spells at all. You cast Spontaneous spells normally.

<span id="usurer"></span>
==== Usurer ====

Minor, Social Status You often lend silver or other valuables to people at interest rates that many consider abusive. You get away with this somehow, possibly because you belong to a group that can avoid moral judgment for these actions, because you operate outside of the law, or perhaps because you lend a type of currency not accepted by the mundane population. You receive the equivalent of approximately ten pounds of silver each year from interest payments, though you may occasionally need to chase down debtors, and you have a poor reputation (Usurer) at level 4 within your community and the local region.

<span id="vendetta"></span>
==== Vendetta ====

Major, Story

The magus is engaged in one of House Verditius' vendettas, mostly likely carrying on his parens's vendetta against another Verditius magus. This vendetta stops just short of physical injury to him or the other. Neither of them will bring this feud to the Quaesitores, wishing to finish it themselves. The magus with whom he is feuding must be an NPC, who regularly takes some sort of action with which the character must contend. This

Flaw is generally restricted to magi of House Verditius, as the custom of vendetta is limited to that House. Other characters should take Enemy or Feud to represent a similar situation.

<span id="vengeful-powers"></span>
==== Vengeful Powers ====

Major, Story, Tainted The character has one or more non-Infernal Powers in which the Infernal realm has taken a personal interest. Whenever she uses one of these Powers in a way that is not sinful, it has an unpleasant side effect. This is always harmful, and often recognizably Infernal, and the severity varies depending upon the Power's application, so that extremely good works cause even more terrible evil. The effect is not obviously linked to the use of the Power, and in fact it may seem completely unrelated. It always manifests at about the same time as the use of the Power, however, though the character may not be aware of this. Some potential side effects might include:

* Illness and disease among local people or animals.
* Open sores and other painful wounds.
* Distrust and a bad reputation among strangers.
* Infernal auras in the surrounding area.
* Negative or sinful Personality Traits.
* Additional botch dice on a particular type of roll.
* Demons suddenly causing havoc in the region.

The forces that wreak vengeance cannot cross Magic Resistance or effects like Aegis of the Hearth that keep demons away, yet they can still sense when these Powers are put to good use, and they retaliate however they can.

The character may not know about these circumstances, but once she realizes the relationship between her Power and these side effects, they usually seem much worse, as paranoia and guilt may cause her to worry

about the potential harm her Powers may cause. Hell hopes that this makes using the Power for good seem too great a sacrifice.

Vengeful Powers may be taken as a Hermetic Flaw, as applicable to Hermetic magic. In that case, the effect triggers whenever the character performs magic that is without sin. It is more commonly associated with Supernatural Abilities, however.

<span id="viaticarus"></span>
==== Viaticarus ====

Minor, Supernatural At some point in the character's past, he was at death's door, and as a result a priest performed the sacrament of Extreme Unction. The purpose of this sacrament was to remit him of all venial sins, and prepare him for the journey beyond (the viaticum); but against all expectations, he survived. This leaves him in a spiritual no-man's land, not one of the dead, but neither wholly of the living. Because of this, he is immune to the temptations of demons, and therefore cannot be affected by their Obsession power; he simply does not register to them as a soul in need of corruption. However, his skin has an unusual pallor, and his eyes are sunken. People may smell a charnel odor about him. These effects are subtle at first, but as he ages, he gradually comes to resemble a corpse more and more, resulting in a penalty to all social interaction rolls equal to his Decrepitude score.

He has difficulty crossing thresholds where unquiet spirits are not welcome; if a person with a (Realm) Lore of 1 or more has set up a traditional ward, such as a line of salt or an iron nail laid on the lintel, then he cannot enter the protected building or area. Further, although he does not have a Might score, he is repulsed by any magical warding that can keep out a creature with a Might score aligned to Corpus or Mentem (including the Aegis of the Hearth), regardless of its level or Penetration. However,

both types of exclusion can be negated if he is invited to cross by the person who established the ward, or someone who lives within. He can still touch individuals with Magic Resistance, since he has no active power around him.

If the character's status is known in the community in which he lives, he should take the Outcast Social Status Flaw.

<span id="visions"></span>
==== Visions ====

Minor, Story, Supernatural You often see images related to\nemotionally or magically laden\nevents. A vision might be of the past, a possible future, or a distant occurrence, and is often symbolic or confusing. Visions\nusually come to you at quiet times or in places connected with a powerful emotional or magical event, such as the site of a patricide or diabolic sacrifice. Your visions may warn you of dangers to come, or get you\ninvolved in matters you would\notherwise have avoided.

The visions come purely at the storyguide's discretion, and reveal only what he wants to reveal.

<span id="vow"></span>
==== Vow ====

Major or Minor, Personality You have sworn to do something difficult, and breaking your vow is a serious matter. Example vows include never raising a weapon, never speaking, or living in poverty. If you do fail to uphold your vow, you must perform some kind of atonement, whether it be religious penance or coming to terms with your failure in some other way. A Vow that is a Major Flaw must be a vow to do something, rather than refrain from something, so that it can drive you to act.

<span id="vulnerable-casting"></span>
==== Vulnerable Casting ====

Minor, Hermetic Some magi are better able to withstand the Fatigue loss of casting spells, and some less so. If a maga has this Flaw, then whenever she is about to lose Fatigue from casting a spell, she loses 1 more Fatigue level than

normal. If the spell would have been cast without Fatigue loss, then she still loses no Fatigue.

A maga may have, or acquire, this Flaw more than once, losing 1 extra Fatigue level for each level of this Flaw. If she has Vulnerable Casting (2), then she loses 2 extra Fatigue levels whenever she casts a fatiguing spell.

Magi of the Mercurian cults often succumb to this Flaw, but other magi may suffer from it, regardless of their affiliation.

The Flaw increases the severity of the Fatigue lost, in the exact manner of the existing Fatigue loss. Thus, if a maga casts a Formulaic spell, the Fatigue is short-term Fatigue, easily recovered, and if she runs out of Fatigue levels she is rendered unconscious, loss of extra Fatigue levels results in her being unconscious for one hour for each overflowing level, and so does the Fatigue from Vulnerable Casting. If, on the other hand, she casts a Ritual spell, then this is long-term Fatigue, and losing more Fatigue than she has remaining causes wounds, so the increased Fatigue of Vulnerable Casting does the same.

You may not start your character with both Vulnerable Casting and Withstand Casting, but the maga may acquire either in the course of play (from Initiation, Ordeals, or Twilight effects). In this case, apply the vulnerability first, then withstand the increased loss.

<span id="vulnerable-magic"></span>
==== Vulnerable Magic ====

Major, Hermetic The character's magic is automatically dispelled in certain uncommon circumstances. Examples include: when touching iron, when under the influence of the Divine, when crossing over running water, when his name is spoken three times, or when he is not touching the ground. This condition immediately ends the duration of a spell when it is applied to the target, or all of your active spells when applied to you.

This Flaw may be taken multiple times, so long as a different condition is specified for each. It may not be combined with Restrictions or Necessary Conditions that have the same (or equivalent) conditions.

<span id="vulnerable-to-folk-tradition-minor-hermetic"></span>
== Vulnerable to Folk Tradition Minor, Hermetic ==

The magus's magic is susceptible to various folk-remedies for averting hostile spells. Any target who is aware that the magus has just used his magic may attempt a folk ritual such as making a sign against evil, or spitting, and so forth. This grants the target or targets a Magic Resistance equal to (5 x the target's Magic Lore), or 0 if the target does not have this Ability, against the magus's magic only. Furthermore, someone with Magic Lore may be able to devise a manner to break a lasting enchantment, such as sprinkling with salt or lying on an iron bed; this typically requires an Intelligence + Magic Lore roll against an Ease Factor of (9 + the spell's magnitude) or greater.

<span id="wanderlust"></span>
==== Wanderlust ====

Major, Story The character feels compelled to travel with a passion that is so strong that he cannot spend more than a season in the same place. The character can only spend two (nonconsecutive) seasons each year in the same area, and must spend the intervening seasons traveling to different locales — places he has never been. If for some reason he cannot travel, he will become very uncomfortable; this discomfort should cause stories in the same way as the travel

<span id="warped-by-magic"></span>
==== Warped by Magic ====

Minor, Supernatural The character's adventures have exposed him to powerful magical forces that have left a mark on him. He has five Warping Points and a Warping Score of 1, including a Minor Flaw (which is not balanced by a Virtue) that somehow reflects the source of

the Warping. His encounters allow you to spend experience points on Magic Lore during character creation. A magus may take this Flaw to represent Warping gained before his apprenticeship. With the permission of the troupe, this Flaw may be modified to represent Warping from other Realms.

<span id="warped-magic"></span>
==== Warped Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your magic is accompanied by some unpleasant side effect that always manifests itself the same way, but with increasing intensity according to the level of the spell. Examples include nearby items become hot or nearby plant matter becomes shriveled and wilted. This effect may cause trouble from time to time, but is usually just annoying.

<span id="warped-senses"></span>
==== Warped Senses ====

Minor, General The character has become overly sensitive to environmental conditions, which affects his behavior in certain uncommon circumstances. Some examples include:

Sensitive (Sense): One of your senses is so sensitive that it is overwhelmed under circumstances that others find normal. If it is sight, normal daylight dazzles you. If it is hearing, sounds above normal speaking volume hurt your ears. If it is taste, only bland food is tolerable. If it is smell, strong odors, good or bad, are nauseating. You suffer a -2 penalty on all activities under relevant circumstances. (It is inadvisable to combine Sensitive Sight with Keen Vision, and Sensitive Hearing with Sharp Ears, and these are incompatible with Blind and Deaf, respectively.)

Weak (Sense): One of your senses is so weak that it is useless under circumstances that others find normal. If it is sight, you can only see well in good illumination (e.g. broad daylight). If it is hearing, you can only hear sounds above normal speaking volume. If taste,

only highly flavored food is palatable. If smell, you can only detect strong odors. You suffer a –2 penalty on all activities under relevant circumstances. (Weak Sight is incompatible with Sensitive Sight, Keen Vision, and Blind and you cannot take Weak Hearing with Sensitive Hearing, Sharp Ears, or Deaf.)

Sensitive to Cold: You function normally at temperatures considerably above the norm for your part of the world. You lose 1 Fatigue level for every hour you spend in an environment two steps or more below your accustomed conditions on the Environmental Temperatures chart (see sidebar). Your responses to heat are reduced in intensity by 2 (page 407).

Sensitive to Heat: You function normally at temperatures considerably below the norm for your part of the world. You lose 1 Fatigue level for every hour you spend in an environment two steps or more above your habituated conditions on the Environmental Temperatures chart (see sidebar). Your response to ice is reduced in intensity to 0 (page 407).

This is a common Flaw for characters who become Warped by a strong magic environment.

<span id="waster-of-vis"></span>
==== Waster of Vis ====

Major, Hermetic

When you use raw vis you waste one guarter (rounded up) of the pawns you apply. The lost raw vis does not apply to the magical effect being enacted but does count toward the total number of botch dice you must roll if you roll a zero. You must use a third again as many pawns as usual when casting a ritual spell, and if you want to improve an Art score by studying raw vis, you must use a third again as many pawns as usual. This Flaw applies to all occasions on which you use vis, including certamen, laboratory work, and boosting penetration. Wasted pawns count toward the maximum number you can use at one time.

For example, if you would normally use 12 pawns, you must use 16, and 4, one quarter of those you use, are wasted. If you would normally need 10 pawns, you must use 14, because 4 pawns are wasted.

<span id="weak-characteristics"></span>
==== Weak Characteristics ====

Minor, General

You have three fewer points to spend buying Characteristics than most characters. You may take this Flaw twice, leaving you with only one point to spend.

<span id="weak-enchanter"></span>
==== Weak Enchanter ====

Minor, Hermetic Your Gift is ill attuned to creating enchanted devices. Halve your Lab Total whenever you create or investigate an\nenchanted item. If you have a Deficiency that counts as part of the Lab Total, apply the Deficiency first and then halve

<span id="weak-magic"></span>
==== Weak Magic ====

the remaining total.

Minor, Hermetic

Your magic is particularly bad at penetrating Magic Resistance. You halve the normal Penetration Total for all spells, and only get half the normal benefit when instilling Penetration into an item. Note that you halve the Penetration Total, after subtracting the spell level and making any adjustments for the use of Arcane Connections. You do not halve the Casting Total and calculate Penetration from that.

<span id="weak-magic-resistance"></span>
==== Weak Magic Resistance ====

Major, Hermetic

Any form of Magic Resistance you generate is much weaker under relatively common circumstances which are fairly easy for an opponent to utilize, such as when you are wet or facing away from the caster of the spell. If the conditions are met, do not subtract the level of the effect from the casting total before calculating Penetration. You would be well advised to keep your weakness from being discovered by too many potential enemies.

<span id="environmental-temperatures"></span>
== Environmental Temperatures ==

* Unnaturally hot
* As hot as being next to a raging fire, molten lava, or molten iron
* Tropical mid-day
* As warm as a fine summer's day in southern Europe
* Comfortable for a normal inhabitant of the Normandy, Rhine, Stonehenge, and Hibernia Tribunals
* As cold as a chilly winter's day in Western Europe
* Arctic winter
* Unnaturally cold

<span id="weak-parens"></span>
==== Weak Parens ====

Minor, Hermetic

Your parens was less powerful or a worse teacher than normal. You gain 60 fewer experience points and 30 fewer spell levels from apprenticeship, for a total of 180 experience points and 90 levels of spells.

<span id="weak-personality"></span>
==== Weak Personality ====

Minor, Personality This character doesn't feel strongly for or against anything and lacks the unique traits most people have to make them really stand out. Consequently, all Personality Traits must be between +1 and -1. When making personality rolls, treat any roll above 6 as merely 6. The character may have no other Personality Flaws or Virtues or Flaws that grant Personality Traits. Depending on the personality of the observer, he may seem a complete pushover with no opinion of his own, insensitive because he rarely shows strong emotion, or simply lacking in initiative to those seeking

leadership and guidance. These elements result in a -1 or worse (at the storyguide's discretion) modifier in most social situations for obviously being a cold fish. Finally, he will never be known for his great loyalty or pious nature, and will have a hard time winning respect or getting promoted. His lack of enthusiasm for the Church in particular might be viewed as a lack of faith. On the plus side, he might occasionally be seen in a positive light since he never disagrees strongly.

<span id="weak-scholar"></span>
==== Weak Scholar ====

Minor, Hermetic You don't understand laboratory guidance very well. You get a –6 penalty to Lab Totals when working from the Lab Texts of others, including when re-inventing spells.

<span id="weak-spontaneous-magic"></span>
=== Weak Spontaneous Magic ===

Major, Hermetic

You may not exert yourself when casting spontaneous magic, so you always divide your Casting Score by five. In stressful conditions you must still roll a stress die to see if you botch, but the die roll does not add to your casting total. You may still use ceremonial casting.

This Flaw may be combined with Difficult Spontaneous Magic (page 126) to create a magus who cannot cast spontaneous magic at all.

<span id="weakness"></span>
==== Weakness ====

Major or Minor, Personality You have a soft spot for some sort of object or person. In the face of this, all else is\nunimportant: promises are forgotten, duties neglected, and common sense cast to the winds. Examples include poets and storytellers, food, flattery, or a pretty face.

<span id="weak-willed"></span>
==== Weak-Willed ====

Minor, Personality You look to others for guidance rather than to yourself. What you need more than anything else is to find someone you can trust.

<span id="weird-magic"></span>
==== Weird Magic ====

Minor, Hermetic Your control over magic is somewhat loose, perhaps due to Twilight effects or\nidiosyncratic training. Roll one\nextra botch die when you roll a zero on stressed spell casting rolls, apart from your other botch dice. Botches from this die should be strange or bizarre rather than dangerous, and if the Weird Magic botch occurs along with a regular botch, the results could be truly spectacular.

<span id="witch-marks"></span>
==== Witch Marks ====

Minor, General, Tainted The character has minor disfigurements that those skilled\nin folk lore recognize as belonging to diabolists. These marks can be hidden with clothing. Characters who are thought of as witches are blamed for misfortunes and may be hounded from towns or killed.

<span id="wrathful"></span>
==== Wrathful ====

Major or Minor, Personality You are prone to anger over the smallest issues, and your rage when you are thwarted in something major is terrible to behold.

<span id="v-abilities"></span>
== V. Abilities ==

bilities represent the things that a character has learned over the course of her life. They increase over the course of a saga, as people continue

learning all the time.

Abilities are normally used by adding Characteristic + Ability + die roll, and meeting or exceeding an Ease Factor. In principle, any Characteristic can be used with any Ability, but some pairings are rare; Strength + Order of Hermes Lore, for example, is unlikely to be called upon very often. The appropriate Characteristic should be chosen based on the descriptions of the Characteristics given in the Characters chapter (page 27), although the rules for magic and combat specify the pairings for a number of important situations.

<span id="specializations"></span>
== Specializations ==

Each Ability you select for your character, except Spell Mastery, should be assigned a specialization. When you are using an Ability in a way that incorporates your specialization, you act as if your score were one level higher than it actually is. For example, if you have the Ability Single Weapon 3, with the specialization longsword, you act as if your Single Weapon is 4 when using longswords.

Suggested specializations for each Ability are listed at the end of each description. Other specializations are possible with the permission of your troupe.

<span id="abilities-with-no-score"></span>
== Abilities With No Score ==

f a character has no score in an Ability, she may or may not be able to use it. If the Ability is a not asterisked in the list from page 159, she may use it as if it had a score of zero, but rolling three extra

botch dice. If it is asterisked, she cannot use it at all.

A character who has placed a single experience point into an Ability may use it with a score of zero, with no extra botch dice, regardless of whether or not it is asterisked. Experience points represent a noticeable amount of training, and thus make the Ability available to the character.

Characters cannot use Supernatural Abilities unless they have at least one experience point in the Ability. Most characters cannot put experience points into any Supernatural Abilities. In most cases, a character needs a particular Virtue in order to put experience points into a particular Supernatural Ability, but there are exceptions. The most important exception is The Gift, which is covered later, and other exceptions are described in supplements.

<span id="ability-types"></span>
== Ability Types ==

here are six types of Ability: General Abilities, Academic Abilities, Arcane Abilities, Martial Abilities, Spell Mastery Abilities, and Supernatural

Abilities. Most of these are used in the same way; the difference lies in who can learn them. Spell Mastery Abilities are a bit different, and are discussed in Chapter 7: Hermetic Magic.

<span id="general-abilities"></span>
== General Abilities ==

Almost anyone in Mythic Europe has the opportunity to learn these Abilities, and there are no game restrictions on who may do so. Even animals have some of these Abilities, although they learn them in different ways from intelligent creatures.

<span id="academic-abilities"></span>
== Academic Abilities ==

Academic Abilities require formal training. Beginning characters may only purchase Academic Abilities if they are specifically permitted to through the purchase of a Virtue, or if they are magi. Magi without a specific Virtue may only buy Academic Abilities during or after apprenticeship. In addition, learning an Academic Knowledge normally requires a Latin, Greek, Hebrew, or Arabic score of at least 3, depending on the region of Europe you are from. For most characters, Latin 3 is required.

Medieval study is based on the auctores, or authorities, in each subject. These auctores are not regarded as infallible or as having said all of what there is to be said on a subject. They are, however, supposed to have gotten the essentials right and to have accurately divided the subject into its categories. Thus, a medieval scholar might suggest that Aristotle was wrong about a certain kind of logical fallacy, but he would not suggest that Aristotle was completely wrong about logic or that there were fallacies that did not fall under any of his classifications.

<span id="arcane-abilities"></span>
== Arcane Abilities ==

A character may only take these Abilities during character generation if permitted to by a Virtue, or if he is a magus. Some Virtues allow a character to take a particular Arcane Ability, but not the others, while other Virtues allow a

<span id="ability-roll"></span>
== Ability Roll: ==

Characteristic + Ability + die roll,meet or exceed the Ease Factor to succeed

Ability of 0 can be used if not asterisked, adding 3 botch dice. Add +1 when using an Ability's specialization.

character to take any Arcane Ability. Any Virtue giving a character a Supernatural Ability that may need to Penetrate Magic Resistance also allows the character to take the Penetrate Ability. Magi without a relevant Virtue may only take Arcane Abilities during or after apprenticeship.

<span id="martial-abilities"></span>
== Martial Abilities ==

Characters may only gain Martial Abilities during character generation if they are permitted to do so by a particular Virtue or Flaw, or if they are magi. Magi without a relevant Virtue or Flaw may only take Martial Abilities during and after apprenticeship.

<span id="spell-mastery-abilities"></span>
== Spell Mastery Abilities ==

Spell Mastery Abilities can only be taken by magi, as they concern the casting of Formulaic and Ritual spells in Hermetic magic. They are described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, on page 225.

<span id="supernatural-abilities-1"></span>
== Supernatural Abilities ==

Characters may only gain Supernatural Abilities during character creation if they have the Virtue granting the Ability. Characters with The Gift who are not magi may learn a single Supernatural Ability during character creation.

Most of these Supernatural Abilities are granted by the Magic or Faerie realms, and use the relevant column on the realm interaction table (page 410). Most can also be granted by the Infernal realm, but taking such an Ability suggests some sort of deal with Infernal powers. Sense Holiness and Unholiness is the main exception, as a Divine power. If you have no reason to choose otherwise, your Ability is granted by the Magic realm, which makes you immune to warping from powerful Magic auras (see page 389). An Ability granted by another realm makes you immune to warping from powerful auras associated with that realm, instead.

The Gift allows characters to learn Supernatural Abilities in play (see page 383). However, The Gift is associated with the Realm of Magic, and thus only allows characters to learn Supernatural Abilities associated with that realm.

<span id="ability-list"></span>
== Ability List ==

This list contains all Abilities, in alphabetical order. The type of the Ability is given in parentheses at the end of its description.

Animal Handling: Care and use of animals, including raising, tending, grooming, and healing them

Specialties: falconry, specific animals. (General)

Animal Ken*: You can communicate with animals as if they were human beings. Treat your score in Animal Ken as your score in a language that the animal speaks fluently in order to determine how well you can communicate, and you can use Animal Handling as a substitute for any social abilities affecting humans. Beyond this, this Ability has no effect on the attitude of animals to you, or you to animals. Other people cannot understand your communication with the animals.

''Specialties'': a particular type of animal, a particular type of communication. (Supernatural)

(Area) Lore*: Knowledge of one particular region, covenant, or even a village. It includes knowing where things are in the immediate area, local history and legends, and the centers of power in the region. The smaller the region, the more detailed your knowledge.

Specialties: geography, history, legends, politics, personalities. (General)

Art of Memory*: The Art of Memory deals with the creation of memory palaces, a form of mnemonic, in which one visualizes a number of loci (singular

locus), where the scholar commits to memory a symbolic representation of a fact to be remembered. The character has a number of loci equal to five times their score in Art of Memory.

To memorize a complex scene, image, or piece of writing (such as a long letter, but not as long as an entire text), the character must succeed in a roll of:

Complex Memorization Roll Stress Die + Intelligence + Art of Memory vs. Ease Factor of 9 (or higher)

The Ease Factor may be higher depending on the length or complexity of the item to be memorized. If the character succeeds, they remember the item in exact detail, and may recall it at will although it may take time to explore a locus.

Characters without the Art of Memory may memorize similar items with a Stress Die + Intelligence roll (with 3 extra botch dice) against the same Ease Factors, but must also repeat the roll to recall the memory perfectly. Each roll failed introduces errors in the memory which are repeated each time it is recalled. Those without the Art of Memory also lack the well-defined location system of loci.

Specialties: an area of knowledge (Academic)

Artes Liberales*: The seven artes liberales, or liberal arts, are the basis of medieval higher education. Everyone learns them at the universities before passing on to study other subjects. It would be very rare for a character to have a score in any other Academic Knowledge without a score of at least one in this one.

The artes liberales are divided into two groups: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music). The emphasis at this period is on the Trivium, but both are taught. (Note that Artes Liberales as a whole is one Skill, not seven separate ones.)

Grammar concerns theoretical questions of the structure of languages, rather than the ability to use a specific language (that is covered by Speak skills). The auctores are Priscian and Donatus. Logic is the study of the syllogism, and other forms of reasoning discussed by Aristotle. It is the most important of the arts at this period. Aristotle is the auctor, in his ''logica vetus'' and ''logica nova''. Rhetoric is the study of the theory of rhetorical forms: knowledge of the sort of tricks that an orator can use, rather than the ability to use them. The auctor is Cicero, especially his ''De Inventione''.

Arithmetic is the ability to add and subtract, multiply and divide. The auctor is Boethius, ''De arithmetica''. Geometry is concerned with study of plane and solid figures, and the auctor is Euclid, in his ''Elementa''. It also deals with the study of light, and Euclid's ''Optica'' is the authority here. Astronomy is concerned with predicting the positions of the stars and planets, and the auctor is Ptolemy, in the ''Libri Almagesti''. Music is purely

<span id="memorization-gase-pactors"></span>
== Memorization Gase Pactors ==

9 (Average)

Memorize a single page letter verbatim, a conversation up to 5 minutes long, or a room as seen from a single vantage point, or the layout (but not contents) of a castle.

12 (Hard)

Memorize a letter of up to 12 pages, or an hour's conversation, lecture or debate, or a room explored and seen from many vantage points, or a whole manor house seen from a single vantage on each room, or the contents (but not details) of a castle.

18 (Impressive)

Memorize an extended missive up to 100 pages, or a day's lecture or debate (such as a day at Tribunal), or a whole manor house in detail, or the contents of a castle.

Anything longer must be broken into sections and memorized as separate loci. If the subject matter is highly technical add 3 or even 6 to the Ease Factor. If the subject is technical and falls within an Ability that the scholar possesses, the scholar may use that Ability in place of Art of Memory (but must still roll to recall as well as memorize): for example a Lawyer using Civil &amp; Canon Law to memorize court proceedings, or a magus using Magic Theory to recall a Bonisagus expert's lecture.

theoretical, the study of proportions and musical theory, not the ability to sing or play an instrument. The authority is Boethius, in ''De Musica''.

Artes Liberales also covers the ability to read and write. For every point in the Ability, the character can read and write one writing system, providing that he knows a language which normally uses that system: the Latin alphabet, the Greek alphabet, the Arabic alphabet, and so on.

A character who does not speak the normal languages of scholarship may learn Artes Liberales to be literate in other languages. It is rare for such a character to have a score over 1, and they must still be able to learn Academic Abilities to do so at character creation.

Specialties: grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic. (Academic)

Athletics: General physical prowess. It includes moving smoothly, confidently, and with grace. Use of Athletics improves most largemuscle coordination.

''Specialties:'' acrobatics, contortions, grace, jumping, running. (General)

Awareness: Noticing things, be they things you are looking for or things that you are not expecting. It is also used to see how alert you are in circumstances that require watchfulness.

''Specialties:'' bodyguarding, keeping watch, alertness, searching. (General)

Bargain: The know-how to get the greatest return for a service or product, while paying the least. It involves reading the person with whom you haggle, a general knowledge of the value of goods, and presenting yourself in certain ways. A good haggler can easily overcome resistance in an inexperienced customer and see through attempts to over-value most merchandise.

Specialties: specific types of products, hard sell. (General)

Bows: Using bows and arrows.

Specialties: any one weapon. (Martial)

Brawl: Fighting hand-to-hand without weapons, or with the sorts of improvised weapons you just pick up, including knives. Brawl is also the Ability used to dodge attacks if you have no Martial Abilities.

Specialties: punches, grapples, knives, dodging.(General)

Carouse: The ability to enjoy oneself without suffering adverse effects. A person with this skill can, for example, consume prodigious amounts of alcohol without passing out. The skill also covers a familiarity with acceptable behavior, balancing enjoyment and moderation. With this Ability, a person is able to have fun and gain friends among the lower classes nearly anywhere, even among those of a different culture.

Specialties: power drinking, drinking songs, games of chance, staying sober. (General)

Charm: Enticing, fascinating, and endearing others to you, but only on a personal basis. It can be used to win someone over emotionally, especially romantically. ''Specialties'': courtly love, first impressions, being witty. (General)

Chirurgy (kie-RUHR-gee)*: This is Middle Ages-style surgery, used to help others recover from physical damage. It encompasses tending and binding wounds of all varieties, and the necessary but brutal skill of cauterization. See page 405 for rules.

Specialties: cauterization, diagnosis, binding wounds, setting bones. (General)

Civil and Canon Law*: Civil Law is the law of the Roman Empire. Most local legal systems are based upon it (England being the notable exception), and when a law is needed to govern international relations, Civil Law is appealed to. The authority is Justinian's Digest. Canon Law is the law of the Church. It is important to Mythic Europe as it applies in all nations, governing the working of the church and some other areas, such as marriage. It is important to note that members of the clergy are only subject to Canon Law, not customary or Civil Law. Most high churchmen are skilled canonists, not theologians. Canon Law is made by Papal bulls (pronouncements), but the auctor is Gratian, in his Decretum. This skill covers the knowledge of both types of law. Other religions, particularly Judaism and Islam, have their own versions of this Ability, which must be learned separately. Specialties: laws and customs of a specific area, papal laws. (Academic)

Code of Hermes*: Judging events according to the Code of Hermes and the Peripheral Code. In addition to memorizing important precedents, this knowledge

includes the practical side of enforcing Hermetic law — for example, knowing when to push for a vote or how to present an argument.

Specialties: Wizards' Marches, apprentices, mundane relations, Tribunal procedures, political intrigue. (Arcane)

Common Law*: Knowledge of the laws of England. There is no authority for this Ability, and it is only taught in England.

Specialties: local laws, exchequer laws. (Academic)

Concentration: Focusing your mental faculties on one task, particularly for extended periods of time. If you are attempting a feat that demands your extra attention, or if you have just failed an action and are trying again, the storyguide can call for a Concentration roll before you can make the attempt. This Ability is especially important for magi because it helps them maintain concentration on spells despite distractions.

Specialties: spell concentration, reading, lab work. (General)

Corpse Magic*: The character can use Corpse Magic to temporarily revive a corpse. The target of this Supernatural Ability cannot have received any burial rites from a Divinely-sanctioned religion, and the corpse must be relatively intact, having as a minimum a spine, a skull, and more than half of its long bones. There need not be any flesh remaining. It takes fifteen minutes to chant the spells sufficiently to awaken the dead.

Casting Total: Communication + Corpse Magic + Aura modifier + stress die

Communication + Leadership + stress die; Leadership may be limited by Language Ability

Compare the result to the Ease Factors at right to determine success.

Specialities: kings, soldiers, compelling truth, animating the dead. (Supernatural)

Craft (Type): A general term for countless Abilities, all dealing with handiwork of some type. In general, Craft Abilities are distinguished by the material they work with, although you may also take a Craft Ability that allows the character to work with several materials in one specific way. You may purchase Craft more than once, choosing a different one each time. Skill in one Craft does not imply skill in any others. City and Guild contains more detailed information about Craft Abilities and their use, in Chapter 4.

Specialties: as appropriate to the craft. (General)

Crafter's Healing*: When using this Ability, each wound can only be treated once, regardless of its severity. Make a Presence + Crafter's Healing + stress die roll against an Ease Factor equal to the Improvement Ease Factor determined by the

<span id="corpse-magic-case-pactor-outcome"></span>
== Corpse Magic Case Pactor Outcome ==

* 9 Speak to the dead. The corpse is not compelled to answer truthfully or directly, although it may do so anyway.
* Protect a corpse from being affected by further Corpse Magic. Any attempt to do so has the Ease Factor increased by the Corpse Magic score of the character.
* 15 Animate a corpse. Orders are followed to the best of the corpse's abilities, but the character must remain in sight of the corpse else it will cease all movement until he returns

8

Take control of an animated corpse. The Commanding roll must be greater than the original animator's (if any), else the corpse continues to follow its previous orders

Animate a corpse and place it under the direct mental control of the character; if he can see the corpse he can issue it orders. He can leave the presence of the corpse and it will continue to obey its orders, but once they are complete it remains motionless until given another order by its creator.

The corpse animates and sits up, allowing the

character converses with it directly. A character who is particularly skilled can cause the corpse to rise out of the grave and walk abroad. The character asks questions or issues commands by making a Communication + Leadership roll; the corpse does nothing unless commanded to do so using a roll of this type. Single word commands have an Ease Factor of 6, simple questions or commands require a 9, and more complex instructions or questions need a 12 or more. The character must know the language that the corpse spoke in life to ask it questions or issue commands. If the character is not fluent in this language (that is, a score of 5 or higher), then the character's Leadership is limited by his Language Ability. Once the character has failed three commanding rolls, the corpse sinks back into its grave or ceases movement, and cannot be subject to Corpse Magic again until the moon has risen. All corpses are also laid to rest if their heads are removed from their body.

Walking corpses typically have a Magic Might of 9 (see Realms of Power: Magic, Chapter 6 for more details). The Penetration Total of the Corpse Magic must exceed this Might to cause it to leave its grave, otherwise it is confined to the earth.

Wound Recovery Table (page 405). Healing a wound costs a Long-Term Fatigue level. If successful, the wound is healed one level: heavy wounds become medium, medium wounds light, and light wounds heal totally. If the roll fails, nothing happens besides fatigue loss. If the roll botches, the healer suffers a similar wound immediately. The wounded recipient gains a Warping Point each time this Ability is used on her, regardless of its success. Specialties: particular kinds of wounds. (Supernatural)

Curse-Throwing*: This Supernatural Ability is usually aligned to the Faerie Realm, but could be aligned to any supernatural realm. It enables the character to heal diseases, remove curses, and dispel detrimental magical effects, but only by transferring (or 'throwing') their effects to another person. Curse-Throwing cannot affect Flaws; specifically, someone with the Lesser or Greater Malediction Flaw is beyond the power of Curse-Throwing, unless it is a Flaw imposed by a faerie or magician with a limited duration. However, any other curse laid by a supernatural power is potentially within the remit of this Ability; note that curses laid directly by God (such as leprosy) are normally represented by permanent Flaws, and thus exempt. Only harmful effects can be transferred with this Ability, and the storyguide is the arbiter in cases where spells are not directly detrimental. Barrenness is a common affliction treated by this power; if transferred to a man or male animal then impotence is inflicted instead. Other curses transferred to inappropriate targets are changed in a similar manner.

To throw a curse, the afflicted person must be physically present, and the recipient of the curse must be represented either in person or by an Arcane Connection. Afflictions can be passed from humans to animals or vice versa, but this is harder than transferring within the same species. Curse-Throwers sometimes transfer the curse to themselves, but such altruism is rare. To throw a curse, the character must perform an elaborate ritual which involves the crafting of a charm which transfers the curse. This charm is a combination of a physical object and a chant. The object is repeatedly touched to the target and the recipient (or the

Arcane Connection), whilst the chant is repeated over and over. The ritual typically takes an hour for every 5 points (or fraction) of the Ease Factor (see below). At the end of this time, the character generates a Casting Total, which must equal or exceed the Ease Factor listed below. If either the sufferer or the intended recipient of the curse has Magic Resistance, the Penetration Total must exceed it, else the curse stays where it is. A botched Curse-Throwing roll swaps the recipient of the curse to the caster.

Curse-Throwing Casting Total:

Presence + Curse-Throwing + Aura + stress die

Penetration Total:

Casting Total – Ease Factor + Penetration Bonus

<span id="example-of-curse-throwing"></span>
== Example of Curse-Throwing ==

A young woman has failed to conceive despite four years of marriage, and she and her mother visit Aelfred, the local faerie doctor. He explains that her barrenness needs to be transferred to another, and the mother volunteers, since she has already had three children. The Ease Factor for this operation is 12, since barrenness is equivalent to a Minor Flaw. The ritual takes three hours, at the end of which, Aelfred generates a Casting Total: 2 (Presence) + 5 (Curse-Throwing) + 5 (stress die) + 2 (Faerie aura of Aelfred's home), for a total of 14. However, unbeknownst to the characters the barrenness was caused by the curse of a local witch. Her Hex Ability score was 5, thus the Ease Factor was actually 17 (12 + Hex 5). Since Aelfred's player succeeds in an Intelligence + Faerie Lore roll, the storyguide informs him that Aelfred suspects that his Curse-Throwing should have worked if the barrenness was natural. Aelfred counsels the mother and daughter to investigate whether they have any enemies with supernatural powers.

(Dead Language)*: This skill is similar to all other (Language) Abilities, but it is only available to educated characters. It grants the ability to speak a language which is no longer used as a native language in the areas the character has lived in. The most important example is Latin, the language of formal education in the West. It is also the common language of the Church and Order of Hermes. In other areas of the world, Arabic, Greek and Hebrew fill similar functions, although of these only Hebrew is a dead language.

Specialties: academic usage, Church ceremonies, Hermetic usage. (Academic)

Dominion Lore*: Knowledge of the manifestations of the power of the Divine. Different from Church Lore (a kind of (Organization) Lore)) because it covers miracles rather than politics, and different from Theology because it is concerned with power rather than doctrine.

Specialties: angels, saints, Divine creatures. (Arcane)

Dowsing*: You have the ability to find things nearby through the use of a dowsing rod (usually a forked stick) and your own intuitive sense. You concentrate on the thing to be found, hold your dowsing rod out in front of you, and follow its subtle motions to the target. If you're looking for something specific, you must have an appropriate sympathetic connection to the thing sought (such as bottled water from a stream when searching for

running water). Before you roll, designate the area in which you are searching — if the item sought is not present in that area, you automatically fail. The time required to search depends on the size of the area, and must be invested whether you succeed or not. It takes about one Diameter (two minutes, or twenty combat rounds) to search for something within 25 paces, and doubling the distance quadruples the time. To find something common, like water, within 25 paces requires a Perception + Dowsing of 9+. Increased distances or dowsing for less common things increases the target number, so that, for example, finding gold within 100 paces would have an Ease Factor of 15.

Specialties: searching for a particular kind of thing (water, gold, etc.), searching in a particular kind of place. (Supernatural)

Embitterment*: You can cause one person to hate another. This Ability is described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, page 245.

Enchanting (Ability)*: When you set your mind to it, you can influence others with a particular performance ability. For a specific effect, you must use words that people can understand. You can calm the grieving with tunes alone, but you need lyrics to convince peasants to rise up against the local lord. General effects work on animals, but specific effects only work on creatures that can understand words. When you use Enchanting Ability, roll a die (stress or simple, depending on the situation) and add Communication and Enchanting Ability. An Ease Factor of 9 will calm the upset, 12 will win someone's love, 15 will incite a riot, and a 24 might win back a soul from the Prince of Darkness. If you botch, you inspire an unwanted emotion.

If the target has Magic Resistance, you must penetrate their resistance, see page 412 for rules.

You should also roll for the quality of the performance, but the magical effect is independent of this, unless you botch. If you do botch the Ability roll, you have failed to produce any performance for some reason, and so the Supernatural Ability automatically fails.

''Specialties:'' a particular emotion, a particular sort of person. (Supernatural)

Enigmatic Wisdom*: The understanding that Criamon magi have of the Enigma. It is described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, on page 236. (Arcane)

Entrancement*: You have the power to control another's will. By staring deeply into someone's eyes for several seconds — generally impossible in combat — you can verbally command the person to perform a certain task. Roll Presence + Entrancement against the target's Stamina roll. The person being controlled may get a bonus to resist at the option of the storyguide, according to the table below. Hermetic magi get their normal Mentem Magic Resistance, and get the normal Stamina roll if the effect penetrates Calculate Penetration using an Ease Factor of 6 + the

victim's bonus. The blind, and people with their eyes closed, are immune; see page 303 for more guidelines on making eye contact. However, it is not possible to look away while being Entranced unless you win the opposed roll.

Specialties: A specific sort of command, a specific sort of person. (Supernatural)

Etiquette: You know the social graces and how to behave in different situations. Etiquette differs from Charm in that Etiquette covers proper behavior, rather than charming behavior. You cannot seduce someone with Etiquette, but neither can you get through an audience with the bishop on Charm alone.

Specialties: nobility, court, peasants, faeries, the Church. (General)

Faerie Lore*: Familiarity with faerie powers, weaknesses, motivations, and areas.

Specialties: faerie forests, faerie mounds, specific types of faeries. (Arcane)

Faerie Magic*: The connection to the power of the Faerie realm possessed by Merinita magi. It cannot be learned by other characters, even if they have access to Arcane Abilities. It is described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, on page 236. (Arcane)

Finesse: Manipulating your spells and performing special feats with them. You would use this Ability to position objects delicately or to target spells.

Specialties: grace, precision, any one Form. (Arcane)

Folk Ken: Understanding the background, personality, and motives of another person. Often the storyguide secretly rolls a die when this Ability is used. Thus, you do not know if your character guessed correctly, or even botched. Specialties: peasants, townsfolk, nobles, clergy, magi, the opposite sex. (General)

Font of Knowledge*: By succeeding in an Ability check (Intelligence + Font of Knowledge + stress die) against an Ease Factor of (6 plus (3 times number of uses of Font of Knowledge that day)) a creature with this Ability may attempt a task with any untrained ability as if they possessed a score of 2. Failed attempts count towards the number of uses in a given day.

Specialties: a particular topic. (Supernatural)

'''Great Weapon:''' Fighting with a weapon which requires two hands to use.

Specialties: any one weapon. (Martial)

Guile: Telling convincing lies, as well as feigning emotion, belief, or frame of mind. If you understand the person you are attempting to deceive (roll 9+ on Perception + Folk Ken), you gain a bonus of +1 to your Guile roll. This Ability also covers disguising yourself, and pretending to be something you are not. It is often an opposed roll, against the victim's Perception + Folk Ken or, for disguise, Perception + Awareness.

Specialties: particular sorts of deception, lying to authority, fast talk, elaborate lies. (General)

Heartbeast*: The ability shared by all Bjornaer magi to take the form of their heartbeast. It is described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, on page 233. This Ability cannot be learned by non-Bjornaer characters, even if they have access to Arcane Abilities. (Arcane)

Hex*: The character has the power to bring about injury or ruin upon her enemies. There are three ways for her to activate this power: by making eye contact with her victim and proclaiming her purpose loud enough for him to hear, by tracing temporary occult signs and symbols on her target that indicate the dark fate she intends, or by acquiring an Arcane Connection to her target and fashioning a recognizable representation that can channel the effect through sympathetic magic.

To hex a target, the character must make clear her will for it: she must declare her wishes to the victim aloud, or indicate the specifics of the hex in writing on or very near the target, or do something to the representation that is similar to what she intends to happen to the target. There is always a physical component to the hex (common practices include tying knots in a line, spitting, or giving the target the &quot;evil eye&quot;).

You must also state a time frame for the hex, anywhere from an effect that occurs immediately to a hex that will affect the third generation of the victim's descendants. Generally speaking, the sooner the effect manifests, the less potent it will be, and the longer the hex delays, the more powerful it will eventually become. For this reason you must always apply the delay modifier (see the sidebar) to the Hex total.

When you have framed the hex appropriately, roll Intelligence + Hex + aura bonus + the delay modifier and compare this to the Ease Factor on the Hex Effects chart. The severity of these effects is comparable to the effects of botching a roll with a specific number of 0's on the botch dice. If you should botch the Hex roll, the hex may still happen, but with unpredictable and unintended results, possibly affecting the character or someone close to her instead. Or, she may suffer Warping Points, fatigue loss, or other unfortunate effects.

<span id="hex-stress-die--intelligence--hex--aura-bonus--modifiers"></span>
==== HEX: Stress Die + Intelligence + Hex + Aura Bonus + Modifiers ====

A potential victim can avoid the effects of a hex by seeking out supernatural protection of some sort, usually from the Divine. If a character receives absolution in a religious ceremony, all hexes that have targeted him are permanently undone. Characters can also remove hexes with other supernatural effects, such as a Perdo Vim spell, a faerie blessing, or a holy miracle. Treat the hex as having a spell level equal to the number of botch dice it approximates, multiplied by 10, so that a Serious hex is a level 20 effect, and a Critical hex is level 40.

Hex is often a false power (as the False Power Flaw) associated with the Magical or Faerie realms. That is, it often uses the Magical or Faerie column of the realm interaction chart, but appears as an unholy power when subjected to divine or infernal powers of investigation. Purely Infernal versions of the power also exist, as do Magical or Faerie versions that are not touched by the Infernal. Such &quot;pure&quot; versions of Hex are rare, however, as demons love to taint this power. Specialties: A specific duration, one method of hexing, a particular effect. (Supernatural)

Hunt: Setting snares, choosing appropriate hunting spots, and following and identifying the spoor of creatures of all varieties. This Ability also lets you cover your tracks or not leave any in the first place.

Specialties: tracking, covering tracks, hunting a specific animal. (General)

Induction*: This is the supernatural ability to create illusions in a person's mind. Only the target can see those illusions. Each attempt at induction requires the inducer to talk with the victim for at least one minute. Characters who cannot hear the inducer are immune to his powers.

Attempts at induction require a die roll of Communication + Induction. Induction is not made more difficult by the complexity of the illusion: it is made more difficult as the risk the victim takes by believing the illusion increases. On some level the victim is aware of the real world, and can snap out of the induced state if threatened.

The Ease Factors for Induction are:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Innocuous
! 3
|-
| Potentially Shaming
| 6
|-
| Potentially Dangerous to Others
| 9
|-
| Potentially Dangerous to Self
| 12
|-
| Potentially Suicidal
| 15
|}

Pick only one of the Roll Modifiers for Induction given below:

Victim is drunk, drugged, exhausted, or critically ill +3

Victim knows and trusts the inducer +3 Site of induction has been carefully prepared with expensive props, in advance +3.

If an Inducer has successfully snared a victim, the Inducer may roll again to try and bump the effect up to the next level of risk. This requires at least fifteen minutes, and on the second roll, the Ease Factor is reduced by 3. An inducer can take a great deal of time, and several rolls, to work a victim up through the levels of danger to potentially suicidal.

A victim of induction realizes afterwards that they have been affected by magic if the roll above does not exceed the Ease Factor by (6 - 1 per factor from the list below).

This value can be reduced by 1 by each of the following factors: choose no more than 3.

* Careful use of props (clothes stained, souvenirs provided)
* Illusion includes brush off (character in illusion returns character home, character falls asleep inside illusion and wakes up in bed)
* No lost time (character in illusion explains it is all happening in one night, no servants notice the character gone)
* Real world effects (character's actions in illusion seem to have altered the real world in verifiable ways)
* Follow up (the character has been convinced previous illusions were real, and this one is part of that larger story).

Specialties: particular kinds of illusion. (Supernatural)

Infernal Lore*: An understanding and familiarity with the Infernal and its agents. Includes knowledge of demons and their habits and weaknesses, undead and their habits and weaknesses, and the power of curses. Specialties: demons, undead, curses. (Arcane)

Intrigue: Dealing and plotting, including subtle use of power in non-confrontational ways to achieve your own ends. Intrigue need not be underhanded or manipulative — it also covers negotiations and knowledge of formal and informal rules of conduct and politeness. In addition, Intrigue also allows a character to pick up important information about those in power, separating fact from useless gossip. Intrigue is a vital talent for those who frequent court or a Hermetic Tribunal.

Specialties: gossip, plotting, rumormongering, alliances. (General)

Islamic Law*: This is the Muslim version of Civil &amp; Canon Law. The major sources of Islamic Law are the Qur'an and the Sunna.

Specialties: any one of the sources of Islamic Law, particular topics, customs of a particular area. (Academic)

Judaic Lore*: Judaic Lore is the knowledge of Jewish cultural practice as opposed to strictly religious details. This includes poetry, folklore, songs, and so on. All Jewish characters are versed in Judaic Lore to some degree and experience points in this Ability at character creation can be part of their childhood abilities.

Specialties: folklore, music, poetry, songs (General)

Leadership: Getting people to obey your orders and to follow you. Can also be used to inspire fear in others, cowing them into submission.

Specialties: intimidation, in combat, inspiration. (General)

Legerdemain*: Sleight of hand and knowledge of confidence games requiring sleight of hand. It requires a delicate touch and great hand-eye coordination. Legerdemain includes filching things from market stalls, cutting purses, and picking such locks as there are, as well as the &quot;magical&quot; trickery often used to raise money from credulous folk. The target of an attempt rolls Perception + Awareness to detect your actions. If the perceiver has Legerdemain skill, he may substitute that for Awareness if he wishes. On particularly delicate moves such as picking pockets, someone trying to spot the character using Legerdemain receives a +3 bonus.

Specialties: filching, picking pockets, &quot;magic&quot; tricks. (General)

(Living Language)*: Fluency in a particular living language. Rather than a die roll modifier, your score in this Knowledge measures your ability to communicate.

When two people speak to each other, the lower Ability score determines how well they communicate. Characters who speak related languages can communicate at a penalty to their scores (assigned by

== '''Entrancement and Induction''' Entrancement and Induction appear similar, because they have a similar scale of Ease Factors, but they differ in practice. Entrancement takes control of a character's will, and dictates their actions, but does not affect what they believe or experience. Induction causes a character to sense things which are not real, and may convince them of things which are not true, but does not force them to act. It is possible for characters to have both Entrancement and Induction, and to use each to bolster the other. For example, &quot;Speak to me&quot; is an innocuous Entrancement, which allows Induction to begin. Inductions that convince a character that something is less risky, or more necessary, than it truly is alter the Ease Factors for Entrancement. ==

You can hold a conversation on everyday topics, although it 3 takes time, you make many mistakes, and your accent is still bad. Functional. You can hold a conversation on non-technical topics, and make few mistakes. People do not normally need to repeat themselves. This is the minimum level required to study from a book. Fluent. You still have an accent if this is not your native language, but it is weak. You speak as well as most natives. This is the minimum level required to write a book. Elegant. You choose your words well, ====

and have no accent if this is not your native

language.

the storyguide) depending on how closely related the two languages are. Two dialects of the same language generally have a –1 penalty. If your character is not specialized in a dialect, you should specify a dialect without specializing in it, and take the penalty when conversing with people who speak a different dialect. If you speak a &quot;standard&quot; version of the language, that is a dialect that differs from all other dialects.

Note that Latin and Hebrew are not living languages in most of Mythic Europe. However, characters who live in places where they are (such as some covenants) may learn this Ability without any special Virtues. The same is true of all languages that are learned as dead languages in one area, but still living languages in another.

Characters with this Ability are illiterate unless they also have a score in Artes Liberales (page 160).

This Ability also covers artistic compositions in the language, and telling existing tales with verve and passion. Knowledge of stories is covered by the appropriate Lore Abilities.

Specialties: poetry, prose, specific dialects, expansive vocabulary, specific technical vocabulary, slang, storytelling. (General)

Magic Lore*: Knowledge of magical creatures, areas, and traditions.

Specialties: creatures, magical traditions, regiones. (Arcane)

Magic Sensitivity*: You are often able to identify a place or object as magical. However, your sensitivity makes you more susceptible to magical effects: subtract your Magic Sensitivity score from your Magic Resistance. When attempting to sense the magic nature of a place or object, the storyguide will assign an Ease Factor—simply roll a simple die + Perception + Magic Sensitivity.

Detecting a Magic aura would normally have an Ease Factor equal to 12 – aura level, so 9 for a level 3 aura and 6 for a level 6 aura.

For spells and enchanted items, an Ease Factor equal to 21 – magnitude of effect is a good guide. For enchanted items, use the magnitude of the most powerful effect in the item.

For magical creatures, 15 – one fifth of the creature's Magic Might is appropriate, so for a creature with a Magic Might of 25, the Ease Factor would be 10.

Specialties: auras, magical creatures, enchanted items, active spells. (Supernatural)

Magic Theory*: Knowledge of what magic is and how it works, used primarily in the laboratory. Magic Theory deals with the technical details of Hermetic magic, Magic Lore covers knowledge of magical things in general. Anyone can learn Magic Theory, if they have access to a teacher or book (normally represented by a Virtue), but it is little use to those without The Gift.

Specialties: inventing spells, enchanting items, a single Art. (Arcane)

Medicine*: Medicine is the formal study of the body and its diseases. Medical practice is based on the theory of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Diseases are often caused by imbalances among them, hence such practices as bloodletting, to restore the balance. Medicine also deals with treating poisons and the results of starvation and the like, but not with treating wounds (see Chirurgy, above). The auctores are Galen and Hippocrates, in many works. It is important to note that medieval medical theory is basically true in Mythic Europe.

Specialties: anatomy, apothecary, physician. (Academic)

Music: The ability to sing, play musical instruments, and compose new music.

Specialties: sing, compose, any one instrument. (General)

(Mystery Cult) Lore*: This is the (Organization) Lore of a particular cult. It provides knowledge of the legends, history, structure, operation and goals of the Mystery Cult in question.

It includes knowledge of the magics, rites and secret passwords and symbolism of the cult, how to covertly signal membership, and how to assess another magus's membership or non-membership in your cult. Two magi with a score in this ability for the same Mystery Cult may well be able to hold a seemingly innocuous conversation without outsiders understanding the true significance or meaning of their words. Many Mystery Cult specialty books also require a score in this ability to decode their heavy symbolism; this method is used to prevent un-Initiated outsiders learning secrets of the Mystery.

Mystery Cult Lore also covers the ceremonies of the cult, frequently enacted whenever the cult gathers formally. It is also a key knowledge for a Mystagogue's performance of the Initiation Rites, to guide the Initiate through the path of Ordeals, ceremony and meditation, to gain new Virtues.

Cult Lore is passed from Mystagogue to Initiate, from Mystae to Mystae in a chain of living secrets. Some cults also write down their secret lores, as this codifies the Mystery and lets others share the same view of the cult — others prefer the secrecy of the Oral Tradition. Small cults may fade away from lack of members, especially if they are persecuted at some point — but if they committed some of their Lore to writing, the cult may be re-born by those who discover and understand the texts. Some cults risk the loss of secrecy for this very reason — that their secrets and magical rites may not be lost forever. Some magi search for lost texts, containing secret lores of the Ancients, hoping to re-enact the rites and rituals that led the Ancients to power.

In game terms, Experience points in Cult Lore are acquired like any other knowledge — including Teaching, Books, Practice and Exposure Learning Cult Lore from another ensures that

master and pupil share the same rites; learning by yourself generally implies that you have devised your own variant (even &quot;deviant&quot;) rites and rituals - from such disagreements schisms arise and cults may break up and fragment.

A magus may build the knowledge from 0, even without instruction — but this means they have devised their own cult, and should treat their Lore as a new Lore. (General) Specialties: personalities, history, politics, one

specific Initiation

(Organization) Lore*: Knowledge of the legends, history, structure, operation, and goals of the specified organization. Organizations can be as large as the Church, or as small as a local craft guild. The smaller the organization, the more detailed your knowledge. Order of Hermes Lore is particularly important to most magi. Specialties: personalities, history, politics. (General)

Parma Magica*: Protection from magic. This is a special ritual (not a Ritual spell) that takes about two minutes to perform. It lets you add 5 times your Parma Magica score to your Magic Resistance until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. You may suppress your Parma Magica temporarily by concentrating; this is equivalent to sustaining a Concentration duration spell. (See page 215). Parma Magica does not require concentration while it is active.

You may also protect one other person for each point in Parma Magica, with their consent. You must touch each person to start the protection, and it lasts as long as at least one character can see the other. The magus may cancel the protection at will, at any distance. While a magus is protecting others, his effective Parma Magica score is reduced by 3 points, both for himself and for the other people he is protecting. If the magus has a Parma Magica score of 3 or lower, his Parma Magica provides each character, including himself, with a Magic Resistance of 0. In the magus's case, this is added to his Form resistance, and a magus protected by another magus's Parma Magica may also add his Form resistance.

Any character protected by a Parma Magica, whether their own or someone else's, is unaffected by the social penalties of other people's Gifts. If a protected character is Gifted, their Gift still imposes social penalties on others, unless those others are also protected by a Parma Magica, or are unaffected by The Gift for some other reason.

Parma Magica can only be learned by Gifted characters, although they learn it as a normal Arcane Ability, not a Supernatural Ability. It is only known by Hermetic magi, as the Order enforces the 'Join or Die' choice rigorously on

anyone who knows it, as well as declaring a Wizard's March on the magus who taught it. Parma Magica is the last thing an apprentice learns, being taught the final key to the Ability after he swears the Oath.

Specialties: protection from any specific Form.

Penetration: Getting your spell through the target's Magic Resistance. See page 215 for full Penetration rules.

Specialties: any one Art. (Arcane)

Persona*: The character with this Ability can alter his appearance to adopt a different identity. He can alter any aspect of his appearance: hair and eve color, complexion, shape of nose, build and height (within the limits of his Size), apparent age, and even gender. These changes are total, proof even to the most intimate mundane scrutiny, but do not change the character's essential nature. Consequently, all Characteristic scores remain unchanged, Virtues and Flaws are transferred to all new forms, and a character who does not normally have a womb cannot become pregnant when adopting the persona of someone

Adopting a different identity requires one round of concentration and a roll of Stamina + Persona against an Ease Factor of 9. Changing back to the character's natural form requires the same concentration and the same roll. Each identity has its own Personality Traits and behavioral quirks, and no Disguise roll is necessary to convince others of the role; this is not a disguise but a whole different person.

The character gains one identity for every point he has in the Persona Ability. Every time the Ability increases by one point, the character must design a new identity.

Specialties: priests, peasants, magi (Supernatural)

Philosophiae*: There are three philosophies natural philosophy, moral philosophy, and metaphysics. Aristotle is the auctor for all of them, in different books. Most scholars study the philosophies after the Arts but before going on to Law, Theology or Medicine. Natural philosophy is the study of the sub-lunar world. It roughly corresponds to today's science. The main texts are the Physica, De Meteorologia, and De historia animalium. Moral philosophy is the study of the proper way of human life. It covers ethics, politics, and economics - the texts are the Ethica, Politica, and Economica. Metaphysics is the philosophy of the fundamental nature of the world. The main text is Aristotle's Metaphysica. The theories of the Philosophiae are all basically correct in Mythic Europe. Specialties: natural philosophy, moral philosophy,

metaphysics, Ritual magic, Ceremonial magic. (Academic)

Premonitions*: You intuitively sense whenever something is wrong, or is likely to go wrong soon. This Ability can be called upon by you or the storyguide, as appropriate, whenever there is a chance to avoid danger. Roll Perception + Premonitions against an Ease Factor depending on the situation. The Ease Factor starts at 3 for imminent, mortal peril, and increases as the distance in time increases and the level of danger decreases. Mortal peril a week in the future would have an Ease Factor of 9, while an imminent minor inconvenience would have an Ease Factor of about 15. If you beat the Ease Factor by 3 or more, you also get some sense of the nature of the danger, with more detail if you roll more highly.

Specialties: threats to a particular person or group of people, particular kinds of threats. (Supernatural)

Profession (Type): The ability to do a job which does not involve making something. Examples include jongleur, marshal, reeve, sailor, steward, teamster, and washerwoman.

Specialties depend on the profession. (General)

Rabbinic Law*: This is the Jewish version of Civil &amp; Canon Law. The major sources of Rabbinic Law are the Talmud, the Oral Torah, and the Responsa of the Geonim.

Specialties: any one of the sources of Rabbinic Law, dietary laws, particular topics, precedents of a given area (Academic)

Ride: Riding and controlling a riding animal, especially under stress.

Specialties: battle, speed, tricks. (General)

Second Sight*: You are able to see through illusionary concealment and disguise, including invisibility, and can also see naturally invisible things such as spirits and the boundaries between regio levels (see page 420). The Ease Factor to see through illusionary concealment is normally equal to 6 + the magnitude of the might of the creature responsible for the effect, or 6 + the magnitude of a Hermetic spell. In general, this Virtue allows you to see through Hermetic concealment effected with Imaginem, but not other Forms. The Magic Resistance, if any, of the concealed creature does not interfere with your Second Sight. If something is actually transformed, for example by a MuCo spell, you cannot determine the genuine form. The Ease Factor to see a naturally invisible thing is normally 9, and the Ease Factor for seeing regio levels is specified on page 421. All Second Sight rolls are Perception + Second Sight, and they are almost always simple rolls.

''Specialties:'' regiones, invisible things, illusory disguises, faeries, ghosts. (Supernatural)

Sense Holiness and Unholiness*: You are able to feel the presence of good and evil. A Perception + Sense Holiness and Unholiness roll against an Ease Factor of 9 lets you sense holiness or

unholiness in a general area; against an Ease Factor of 15, in a person or object. The Ease Factor to detect a demon is 0, but the character must still Penetrate its Magic Resistance. If an angel is hiding its divine nature, which is unusual, the Ease Factor is 15, and the character must Penetrate. If the angel is not hiding its divine nature, the roll automatically succeeds. In auras of particularly strong divine or infernal influence, your sensitivity may overwhelm you. This Ability is granted by the Divine realm, not the Magic or Faerie realms, and thus uses the Divine column of the realm interaction chart (page 410).

Specialties: good or evil. (Supernatural)

Sense Passions*: The character can sense the personality and desires of an intelligent being by recognizing and identifying the different shades of tarnish on its soul. A Perception + Sense Passions roll against an Ease Factor of 9 lets her sense the most powerful emotion currently being

experienced by the person, and a roll against an Ease Factor of 15 allows her to identify the character's most dominant Personality Trait. The effect must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance if it has any kind of supernatural protection, and since this is a Supernatural Ability, it is affected by auras.

Sense Passions: Stress Die + Perception

* Sense Passions + Aura

Through careful examination, the character can also recognize passions in people within the general area, allowing her to hone in on the most powerful source of emotion within sight, usually the character with the highest (or lowest) Personality Trait. This requires a 12 or better on the Sense Passions roll.

The character can also tell when an aura has a tarnish (see ''Realms of Power: The Infernal'', page 13) or temper (see ''Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition'', page 38) and its type or types by overcoming an Ease Factor of 6.

By sensing passions, the character can often recognize incorporeal spirits. You may treat Sense Passions as Second Sight when attempting to recognize the presence of invisible or bodiless beings. However, this does not allow her to see through illusions, even illusions of strong emotions, and she cannot actually see the spirits, merely sense their proximity.

In addition, this Ability allows the character to Sense Holiness and Unholiness in a limited fashion, much like the Sense Holiness and Unholiness Ability. She can tell that something is either holy or unholy, but she cannot distinguish between the two. She feels the emotional presence associated with the Divine or the Infernal, but cannot pinpoint its supernatural origin. Thus, she might mistake a demon with a fair shape for an angel, or a fearsome-looking angel for a demon. By identifying the target's primary emotions or desires, however, you can usually get a good idea of which realm the target is associated with, assuming the character can penetrate its Magic Resistance.

Sense Passions is either a false power (see the False Power Flaw), or is associated with the Infernal. This means that it always appears infernal to divine or infernal detection. The presence of Infernal taint allows the Sense Holiness and

Unholiness aspect to work. If the troupe allows Divine powers to be false, this may be the false version of Sense Holiness and Unholiness.

Specialties: auras, emotions, Personality Traits, in a general area. (Supernatural)

Shapeshifter*: You may change your shape into that of a mundane animal from the size of a robin (-10) to that of a bear (+2). This requires a few seconds' (one round's) concentration, and a roll of Stamina + Shapeshifter against an Ease Factor of 9. Changing back to human form requires the same concentration, and the same roll.

You have a limited repertoire of shapes, one for every point you have in the Shapeshift ability. Every time you raise the Ability by one point, you may choose a new shape.

Specialties: One of your shapes, particular conditions for the change. (Supernatural)

Single Weapon: Fighting with a weapon used in one hand, possibly using a shield with the other. This includes lances used as intended from horseback.

Specialties: any one weapon or shield, which covers using that weapon with any shield or none, and that shield with any weapon. (Martial)

Stealth: Sneaking about without being seen or heard, also hiding in one place. This includes following people without their noticing, which is rolled against the other person's Perception. Specialties: hide, sneak, shadowing, urban areas, natural areas. (General)

'''Summon Animals*''': You can summon animals. This Ability is described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, on page 243.

Survival: Finding food, water, shelter, a direct route, and relative safety in the wilderness (a very dangerous place in Mythic Europe). This Ability covers such mundane tasks as building a fire and cooking food without implements.

Specialties: specific locales. (General)

Swim: The ability to propel yourself through water quickly and efficiently.

Specialties: long distances, diving, underwater maneuvering. (General)

Teaching: The ability to teach an Ability to someone else.

Specialties: a particular Ability, particular kinds of student. (General)

Theology: Christian*: Theology is the study of God and his work in the world. The auctores are the Bible and Peter the Lombard's Sententiae, the Bible having theoretical primacy, being infallible, and the Sentences being most studied. The speculations of theology are very abstruse, and many theologians are accused of heresy. Sometimes

those accused recant, and sometimes they convince the Church that they were right after all. Specialties: biblical knowledge, heresy, history.

(Academic)

Theology: Islam*: This is the Islamic equivalent of Theology: Christian. The major sources for Islamic theology are the Qur'an and the Sunna.

Specialties: the Qur'an, debates, history, prophets. (Academic)

Theology: Judaism*: This is the Jewish equivalent of Theology: Christian. The major sources for Jewish theology are the Torah, the Nevi'im, and the Kutuvim.

Specialties: the Torah, creation, history, prophecies (Academic)

Thrown Weapon: Fighting at range using weapons which are thrown.

Specialties: any one weapon. (Martial)

Whistle Up The Wind*: You can create wind by whistling. This Ability is described in the Hermetic Magic chapter, on page 246.

Wilderness Sense*: You are mystically attuned to the ways of the wilderness. A Perception + Wilderness Sense roll against an Ease Factor of 9 lets you determine the direction of north, the upcoming weather, or the presence of natural hazards or resources. One roll will only reveal one piece of information.

Specialties: direction, weather, hazards, resources. (Supernatural)

<span id="vi-covenants"></span>
== VI. Covenants ==

he covenant is the single most important character in most ARS MAGICA sagas, because it is the character that all the players contribute to. It is their home, a

secure base, and the place where they study, improve, and create magical wonders. Thus, coming up with a concept for the covenant is very important, as it will have a strong influence on the feel of the saga. A saga based on a covenant located in a hidden regio in the heart of Constantinople will be very different from one based in a covenant occupying a large castle on an island off the coast of Scotland, and different again from one based in a covenant in a magical glade in the heart of a haunted forest in Brittany.

Although the covenant concept has an influence, it isn't all-defining. Many stories will, after all, take the magi away from their covenant, and if the troupe decides that it likes a particular sort of story, most of the stories may take place away from home. Covenants can even be moved, a proposition that will create a lot of stories in itself. This means that you should choose a concept you like when you start out, without worrying that you will be stuck with it forever.

<span id="through-the-aegis"></span>
== Through the Aegis ==

Through the Aegis contains five fully developed covenants, one for each of the seasons and one that has been through Winter and returned to Spring. The magi and other important inhabitants are given full statistics, and the buildings and resources of the covenant are described in full. While they are nominally set in particular Tribunals, they could be moved to another Tribunal and serve as your troupe's covenant; the players could even play the characters described there. They can also serve as a source of inspiration, and as places for the player characters to visit during the saga.

<span id="aegis-of-the-hearth"></span>
== Aegis of the hearth ==

The spell Aegis of the Hearth (page 370) is one of the most important spells in the Order of Hermes. While Parma Magica gives individuals magic resistance, Aegis of the Hearth (often just 'the Aegis') gives it to a whole covenant. The number of Hermetic covenants with no Aegis at all can most likely be counted on the fingers of one hand, and most covenants want to have the strongest Aegis that they can manage. Thus, if none of the player characters start knowing the spell, you should include it in the covenant library, probably as both a Lab Text and a casting tablet (see later), and make learning it a high priority for someone. Casting the Aegis from a casting tablet is possible, but it is risky in the long term. Note that if the covenant includes magi who are older than the player characters, the player characters need not be able to cast it.

<span id="covenant-seasons"></span>
== Covenant Seasons ==

he Order of Hermes traditionally classifies covenants into four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. These informal labels refer to the different stages of a

covenant's life, and most magi agree on them most of the time. They are also an important part of the covenant concept, because a lot of features depend on the season.

<span id="spring"></span>
== Spring ==

Spring covenants are just getting started. They are recently established, have few resources, and are generally populated by few and weak magi. Many Spring covenants fail to reach a later season.

You should create a Spring covenant if you want a pioneer feel, with relatively young magi creating their own home from nothing. They may not be on a literal frontier, although they should be quite some distance from any other covenants to avoid immediate

basic buildings when the saga starts, and the magi have already created their own laboratories. Nonmagi have been gathered, and the magi may even have been living in the covenant for a season or two.

However, it is perfectly possible to start with nothing but a Magic aura, and roleplay every stage of building the covenant. In some ways, this is a good way for new troupes to start, because there will be a lot of stories and not much laboratory work early on, which gives everyone a chance to become comfortable with the rules step by step. On the other hand, more experienced troupes who want to get straight into laboratory work might find that frustrating.

A Spring covenant could also be founded in the ruins of an older, failed covenant. This provides a good source of stories right on the covenant's doorstep, along with the chance of finding Hermetic resources as treasure (something that otherwise tends to be implausible).

Finally, a Spring covenant could refer to the state of mind of new, young members of a Winter covenant. The covenant has decayed so far that it isn't really a matter of reinvigorating it — the characters are effectively starting again. Much like the ruin, this provides the opportunity to find Hermetic resources lost within the covenant

structure, and this is a perfect

conflicts over resources.

In most cases, a Spring covenant already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has a story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has story already has a story already has story already has story already has story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a story already has a

<span id="vernus"></span>
==== Vernus ====

The covenant of Vernus is a Spring covenant, just starting out in the world. It is a weak covenant (see the Base Covenant Resources insert on page 178), and is Struggling (see page 177).

At the moment, the covenant consists of a number of tents pitched around a standing stone, in a clearing in the middle of a faerie forest. The stone and clearing exist in a magical regio (see page 421), although there are several ways to get into it. The base level has a Magic aura of 2, and the covenant itself is located on a level with an aura of 5. The magi hope that there are higher levels, where they will be able to put their laboratories, but they haven't found them yet.

The main concern for the covenant is mundane resources. They don't even have a regular supply of food, and the current plan is to cut a new village out of the forest, and fill it with peasants who will farm for the magi. Various schemes for getting mundane income, such as growing grapes, finding a silver mine, or pretending to find a silver mine and just creating silver, are all under consideration.

The covenant's only vis source is contested, with the faeries who guard it. The nature of the contest varies from year to year, and is never simple combat. The best thing to do is take a wide variety of characters, so that they will be able to handle whatever the faeries decide to throw at them.

<span id="summer"></span>
== Summer ==

Summer covenants are firmly established, and still growing. The length of a covenant's Summer determines its ultimate power, and has a strong influence on the length of time for which it endures.

A Summer covenant is still growing, but the player characters do not have to worry about establishing it. In addition, they are probably not the oldest members of the covenant, so they do have local older magi to turn to for advice and assistance, if necessary. This makes a Summer covenant an excellent choice if your troupe consists of one or two experienced Ars Magica players and several newcomers. The experienced players can share the job of storyguide for the covenant, and thus provide in-character advice and guidance as the elder magi.

On the other hand, Summer covenants are not normally so organized that the older magi can give orders to the younger magi. Thus, the player characters are generally free to follow their own plots.

<span id="aestas"></span>
==== Aestas ====

Aestas is a Summer covenant. It is of medium power (see page 178), and has become the Mundane Lord of the local village.

The covenant itself is a large castle, although the fortifications are not as up-to-date as they might be. Each magus lives in a separate tower in the curtain walls, while the central keep holds the library, council chamber, and dining hall. The covenfolk live in buildings built both inside and outside the curtain walls, and at the moment a lot of the covenant supplies are kept outside the walls, which rather lessens their value.

The magi have chosen one of their number, a magus with the Gentle Gift, to serve as their liaison with the outside world, and he has been forced to become good at politics. So far the covenant has managed to put off the need to swear fealty to any mundane by bartering favors and threats for a little more neutrality, but it is extremely unlikely that they will be able to put this off forever. They are thus trying to get a 'tame' noble who can accept the covenant's fealty but won't try to actually exercise his rights.

Aestas keeps a very low profile in Hermetic politics, and is always helpful and generous to visiting magi. They use their wealth to provide extremely good hospitality to Redcaps, and other magi are welcome to stay and study in their library. They even allow magi to copy books, for a small fee. As a result, most magi think that they are harmless and well-meaning, and as long as they avoid major interference with mundane politics they think the Quaesitores will leave them alone.

<span id="autumn"></span>
== Autumn ==

An Autumn covenant is living off past glories, but has yet to go seriously into decline. The most powerful covenants in the Order are in Autumn, as the Autumn that follows a long and vigorous Summer can last for centuries.

There are, essentially, two ways to play an Autumn covenant. In one, the player characters are young members of the covenant, and have to work with the elder magi. In the other, player characters themselves are the elder magi.

Playing junior magi is a good option for players who like the idea of the game, but have no idea what their characters would do, as long as the storyguide does have ideas. The senior magi can send the player characters to accomplish certain tasks, and as they succeed and prove themselves they will naturally be granted more independence, so that as the players reach the point of wanting to follow their own projects, their characters have the freedom to do so.

Playing elder magi is only for experienced players, if only because the first step is creating elder magi, and that requires you to be familiar with the magic rules. It makes for a very different saga style, as the magi are extremely powerful. See the Sagas chapter, page 523, for suggestions.

Autumn covenants can be at various stages of their Autumn. A covenant just out of Summer would be vigorous, but turning more and more to conserving what it has rather than expanding. A covenant in the heart of Autumn would be focused on conservation, and doing a good job of it. As Winter approaches, conservation becomes less effective, but the members of the covenant are reluctant to strike out into new ways of doing things. At any stage, there might be some large threat at the heart of the covenant that could tip it instantly into Winter if uncontained, or some promise that could put the covenant back in Summer if it was understood. Both are possible, and both could even be the same thing.

<span id="autumnus"></span>
==== Autumnus ====

Autumnus is a powerful Autumn covenant; a powerful covenant (page 178) with Autumn Power (page 177).

The physical structure is a single enormous building, covering the whole of a mountain peak and kept warm and habitable by magic. The entrances to the building are protected with magic as well as solid mundane doors, and the need to climb a mountain first makes a serious attack very difficult indeed. Inside, the halls and corridors are opulent, with minor enchanted devices all over the place.

There are over a dozen magi in the covenant, and the oldest four form a ruling council. They are the only magi with unrestricted access to the covenant's resources, and the most junior magi must obey orders from the council if they wish to retain their membership. The council is still composed of relatively wise magi (that is, relative to most magi...), however, so the orders are not onerous, and are for the covenant's good. Magi are still keen to join, as the resources available to even the youngest members are amazing.

Autumnus has another, much smaller, covenant in a different Tribunal under its protection. Young magi are often given the job of going to help this covenant, which is occasionally awkward, as they are younger than the older magi at the other place. However, having solid contacts in another Tribunal is politically extremely useful, as another strong Autumn covenant is a major rival. The origins of the rivalry are embroidered whenever they are told, but basically the Tribunal isn't big enough for two covenants of this power; they found themselves constantly stepping on each other's toes. The struggle has stayed within the Code so far, but if one side starts to clearly lose, it may not stay there.

<span id="cinter"></span>
== Cinter ==

Winter covenants are in decline, and on their way to oblivion. They are normally filled with old and peculiar magi, with little interest in recruiting new blood. However, sometimes new recruits are brought in, and the covenant moves round to Spring once more.

Pulling a Winter covenant through to Spring is a good saga concept for players who want the freedom of the Spring saga, but also want to be living somewhere with history, lost books, and whole towers where no-one has set foot in years. The difference from a Spring saga set in a Winter covenant is mainly that the player characters have to deal with the old inhabitants; magi who are far older and more powerful than they are, but who are interested only in their own bizarre research.

Experienced players might also want to play the old magi in a Winter covenant, concentrating on their own interests as the covenant slowly crumbles around them.

<span id="diems"></span>
=== '''Diems''' ===

Hiems is a Winter covenant. It is of medium power (page 178), and Winter Ruins (page 178). The covenant now has only six magi, whereas once it had over a dozen, and the number of covenfolk has shrunk by an even greater factor. As a result, the complex of caves, tunnels, and towers covering most of a magical forest is largely uninhabited. The routes between the residences of the remaining magi and the central facilities (library, council room, kitchens) are well-maintained, but there are other areas that no-one has entered for years.

One of the old laboratories was in the lair of a dragon, and it seems that the dragon, or at least a dragon, has come back. The covenfolk have reported seeing it, and some have simply disappeared while traveling from one part of the covenant to another. Such disappearances are also attributed to the dragon.

Hiems, in its prime, had many vis sources, but now it hardly has the resources to harvest them all, and other covenants are trying to move in. Hiems has to contest the other covenants for the rights to use the sources, and it isn't clear how much longer they will continue to win.

Still, the covenant had more resources once, and many of them are likely to still be somewhere in the ruins. New magi could turn it back into the power it once was, or simply provide food for the dragon.

<span id="autumn-power"></span>
== Autumn Power ==

The covenant is a strong Autumn covenant, a position that brings its own problems in the form of rivals, political involvement, and hierarchy.

Hooks: Hermetic Politics (Minor), Protector (Minor), Castle (Major), Rival (Major), Superiors (Major)

Boons: Aura (Minor) x2, Edifice (Minor), Hidden Resources (Minor), Prestige (Minor), Curtain Walls and Mural Towers (Major), Wealth (Major)

<span id="mundane-lord"></span>
=== Mundane Lord ===

The covenant has become the lord of a number of mundanes. This may be in direct breach of the Code, so the members likely spend a lot of time making sure that the Quaesitores never become too interested in their activities.

'''Hooks''': Castle (Major), Mundane Politics (Major) '''Boons''': Edifice (Minor), Tower Keep (Minor), Wealth (Minor), Prestige (Major)

<span id="powerful-location"></span>
=== Powerful Location ===

The covenant is located in a place of great magical power. In many ways this is helpful, but it brings its own problems.

Hooks: Monster (Minor) x2, Regio (Major)

Boons: Aura (Minor) x5. (The covenfolk must live within this aura, so almost all suffer from Warping. See page 389.)

<span id="struggling"></span>
== Struggling ==

The covenant has few resources, and some enemies, and has to work hard just to survive. Stories are likely to concern very mundane issues, such as food supplies, at least until the crisis is resolved.

Hooks: Contested Resource (Minor), Poverty (Major)

Boons: Aura (Minor) x2, Regio (Minor), Seclusion (Minor)

<span id="trban"></span>
=== '''Trban''' ===

The covenant is hidden in a regio in a city. While this makes reaching a market easy, it brings its own problems. Tolosa Paratge, in the Provençal Tribunal, is an example of such a covenant (Faith &amp; Flame, page 38).

Hooks: Urban (Major)

Boons: Aura (Minor), Regio (Minor), Wealth (Minor)

<span id="winter-ruins"></span>
=== Winter Ruins ===

The covenant is in part of the structure of a Winter covenant. It may be the current state of the old covenant, or a refoundation. The contents of the ruins are a major concern to the characters.

Hooks: Contested Resource (Minor) (x3), Monster (Major), Poverty (Minor)

he covenant should be created by the whole troupe, working together. The first step is to create a solid covenant concept, before picking the

numbers to fill it out. In covenant creation, the troupe can simply choose how powerful the covenant is, so such things need to be decided in advance.

<span id="base-covenant-resources"></span>
== Base Covenant Resources ==

The following three sets of covenant resources are provided as examples. If you want to save time, just pick one for your covenant. The Customized Covenant Creation rules on page 179 allow you to tailor the covenant more precisely to your needs, but it does take longer.

The Arts and Abilities covered by the books, spells available as Lab Texts or Casting Tablets, and types of vis available should be chosen based on the interests of the player character magi.

<span id="weak-covenant"></span>
== Weak Covenant ==

Library: Three Art summae (level 15 quality 12, level 12 quality 12, and level 6 quality 21), one Ability summa (level 4 quality 10), and four tractatus (qualities 11, 10, 10, and 9), on either Arts or Abilities.

Lab Texts: 200 levels of spells, none over level 25.

Vis: 1 or more sources, providing a total of 4 pawns per year. No stocks.

'''Build Points Spent: 200'''

This is suitable for a Spring covenant, or for the resources accessible in a Winter covenant.

<span id="medium-covenant"></span>
=== Medium Covenant ===

Library: Eight Art summae (three at level 16, quality 15, five at level 6, quality 21), three Ability summae (one at level 5, quality 20, and two at level 6, quality 15), and seven tractatus on either Arts or Abilities (two quality 11, four quality 10, and one quality 9)

Lab Texts: 1,000 levels of spells, none over level 40

Vis: At least three sources, each providing a different Art, yielding a total of 20 pawns per year. Vis stocks of 100 pawns, spread between Arts as desired. The stocks may all be of a single Art.

Enchanted Items: 200 levels of enchanted items, with a highest level effect of 40. At least 100 levels should be spent on lesser enchanted devices with an effect level of 20 or lower.

'''Build Points Spent: 800'''

This is suitable for a covenant in early Summer, or for the resources immediately available to young magi in an Autumn covenant.

<span id="powerful-covenant"></span>
=== Powerful Covenant ===

Library: Seventeen Art summae, at least one in each Art (one at level 20, quality 11; one at level 18, quality 13; five at level 16, quality 15; ten at level 6, quality 21), six Ability summae (three at level 6, quality 17, and three at level 5, quality 20), and thirty tractatus (12 quality 11, 9 quality 10, 9 quality 9), on either Arts or Abilities.

Lab Texts: Lab Texts for 2,500 levels of spells, with no upper limit on the level of individual spells.

Vis: At least five sources, each providing a different Art, yielding a total of 50 pawns per year. Vis stocks of 250 pawns, divided freely between the Arts.

Enchanted Items: 500 levels of enchanted items. At least one should have an effect level over 30, and at least 100 levels should be spent on lesser enchanted devices with an effect level of 20 or lower.

Build Points spent: 2000

This is suitable for a covenant in high Summer, the total resources of a relatively weak Autumn covenant, or the resources available to young magi in a very powerful Autumn covenant.

<span id="baseline"></span>
== Baseline ==

The base for covenant creation is a stone building with enough room to accommodate the magi and other covenfolk, located in a level 3 Magic aura. The covenant has no magical resources, but has sufficient mundane resources to ensure that the magi do not have to worry about day-to-day upkeep. There is about one grog (fighter) per magus, and there are about two other covenfolk, such as servants and craftsmen, per magus. The available craftsmen include a blacksmith, carpenter, and maybe a bookbinder, but more exotic specialists are not present. While the covenant is hard to get into, it could not withstand a serious military assault without the use of magic. The Aging Modifier for a basic covenant is 0.

The covenant could be an isolated tower on a hill, a group of buildings in a clearing in forest, a complex of caves, or any number of other things. At any rate, it is somewhat removed from mundane society.

<span id="accessible-power-level"></span>
== Accessible Power Level ==

The first choice is the level of power within the covenant that is accessible to the player character magi. This is a simple choice, depending on the sort of saga the players want. Novice players should start with a medium or low power level.

Maximum Level: The highest level of a single Lab Text or a single effect in an enchanted device. In the case of a device, the level includes all modifications (see Magical Enchantments on page 252 for more details).

Minimum Age: The minimum number of years that have passed since the foundation of the covenant.

Note that this is the power that the player magi can access at will. An autumn covenant with a strict hierarchy might only have a low level of accessible power, because the player magi are not allowed to use most of the resources.

<span id="resources"></span>
== Resources ==

Resources are very important to magi, as they determine how quickly they can learn and improve their Arts and other magical abilities. Books are described in the Long Term Events chapter (page 379), Lab Texts and Casting Tablets in the Laboratory chapter (page 262), and vis and its uses in the Hermetic Magic, Laboratory, and Long Term Events chapters. Enchanted items are described in the Laboratory chapter (page 274).

<span id="library"></span>
== Library ==

The library is probably the most important resource in most covenants. Unlike vis, books can be studied over and over again, being used by all the members of the covenant. Rules for books can be found on page 379; there are two types, summae, which can be studied multiple times, and tractatus, which can be studied only once. Summae have a level, and once a character's level in the subject of the book equals that level, the book is no longer of any use. Tractatus can be used by characters at any level. The quality of a book is a measure of how good it is, higher is better.

Art Summae: Add level and quality together. Each summa costs one Build Point per point in the total. The level must not exceed 20; higher-level summae can only be obtained through play. The quality must not exceed 11 plus 1 for every point below 20 of the level, and must not exceed 22 in any case.

ART SUMMA COST: Level + Quality ART SUMMA LEVEL LIMIT: 20 ART SUMMA QUALITY LIMIT: 11 + (20 – Level), or 22, whichever is lower

Ability Summae: Add quality and three times level together, and each summa costs one Build Point per point in the total. The level must not exceed 8. The quality must not exceed 11 plus 3 for every point below 8 of the level, and must not exceed 22 in any case.

ABILITY SUMMA COST: Quality + 3 x Level ABILITY SUMMA LEVEL LIMIT: 8 ABILITY SUMMA QUALITY LIMIT: 11 + 3 x (8 – level), or 22, whichever is lower

'''Tractatus:''' A tractatus in either Arts or Abilities costs one Build Point per point of quality. The quality may not exceed 11.

Tractatus Cost: Quality Tractatus Quality Limit: 11

<span id="lab-texts"></span>
=== Lab Texts ===

Lab Texts allow magi to research magical creations much more quickly than they could without assistance. By far the most common form of Lab Text is the Lab Text for inventing a Formulaic spell, and most covenants have many levels of such Lab Texts in their libraries.

Five levels of Lab Texts cost one Build Point. See the power level table on page 179 for the maximum level of Lab Text that can be taken.

LAB TEXT COST:

1 Build Point per five levels

<span id="casting-tablets"></span>
== Casting Tablets ==

Casting Tablets allow magi to cast Formulaic or Ritual spells that they do not know (see page 263). Not all covenants have such things, and those that do normally have them for spells that they do not need very often. Some covenants cast their Aegis of the Hearth from a Casting Tablet, but that is rather risky.

Five levels of Casting Tablets cost two Build Points, and use the same level limits as Lab Texts.

Casting Tablet Cost: 2 Build Points per five levels

<span id="vis"></span>
==== Vis ====

Vis sources, which provide vis every year, are extremely valuable resources for a covenant. Vis stocks are also useful, and most covenants try to have some in store for emergencies. See page 212 for more information on raw vis, and page 422 for information on vis sources.

Vis Sources: Vis sources cost five Build Points for every pawn of vis available each year.

VIS SUPPLIES COST: 5 Build Points per pawn of vis per year

Vis Stocks: Vis stocks cost one Build Point per five pawns of vis in store. Once vis stocks are used, they are gone until the characters can find, in play, more vis.

Vis Stocks Cost: 1 Build Point per 5 pawns of vis

<span id="enchanted-items"></span>
== '''Enchanted Items''' ==

An enchanted item costs two Build Points for every five levels of effect, including modifications. See the power level table on page 179 for the maximum level of any individual effect.

Enchanted Item Cost: 2 Build Points per five levels of effect, including modifications

<span id="specialists"></span>
== Specialists ==

Specialists are non-magus NPC members of the covenant with useful skills. They are defined only by the abilities they use to serve the covenant, rather than by a full character sheet, and can include guards as well as teachers and craftsmen. Characters created as grogs or companions need not be paid for with Build Points.

Teachers: A teacher bought with Build Points is employed by the covenant, and available to teach as directed by the magi two seasons per year. The cost is the sum of his Communication and Teaching total and his highest score in the Abilities he will teach. Teachers cannot have The Gift, and thus cannot teach the Hermetic Arts. They may have other Supernatural Abilities, however. Their Abilities are limited by their age, as for newly created characters (see page 48).

Teacher Cost: Communication + Teaching

* Highest Ability Score

Score Limits: By age (see page 48)

Others: Other kinds of specialist are less expensive, costing a number of Build Points equal to their highest score in the Ability they use to serve the covenant. Their Ability scores are initially limited by age, as for teachers.

Specialist Cost: Highest Ability Score Score Limit: By age (see page 48)

== hooks ==

Hooks are features of the covenant that lead to stories. Hooks come in two kinds, Major and Minor, just as character Flaws do. However, there are no Hooks that simply weaken the covenant; they are all concerned with story ideas. A covenant may have as many Hooks as the players want, but as these choices are indications of the stories that the players want, the troupe should not take so many that some never come up. That would just disappoint the players who wanted that sort of story. Hooks do not provide Build Points. Instead, they allow the players to take Boons (see page 183) for the covenant. A Major Hook provides three points that can be spent on Boons, while a Minor Hook provides one point.

The Hooks listed below are merely examples. A Hook can be anything that the troupe thinks will make the saga more interesting, and ''Covenants'' provides many more examples.

<span id="minor-hooks"></span>
== Minor hooks ==

Contested Resource: Access to one of the covenant's accessible resources is contested with someone, or something, else. Thus, getting the resource requires a story. As a rule, one story means that the resource is available for five years. The resource in question should be of sufficient importance that the magi will want to bother with the story.

This Hook may be taken multiple times to cover multiple resources. It may be Unknown when the saga starts, and only become known when the first contest comes due.

Favors: The covenant owes favors to someone or something, possibly another covenant, or possibly a mundane lord, bishop, or supernatural creature. This person cannot give the covenant orders, but the covenant is really obliged to help if they are in difficulties.

This Hook could be Unknown, if the obligations were incurred by other members of the covenant who have neglected to tell the player characters.

Hermetic Politics: The covenant is engaged in the elaborate game of trading of favors that passes for politics in some Hermetic tribunals. When the saga begins, the covenant owes favors to three other covenants, but is owed three favors as well. The Coenobium Rhodanien, in the Provençal Tribunal, is notorious for its involvement in Hermetic politics, preventing the foundation of any covenants that it does not control over a substantial area of the tribunal (''Faith &amp; Flame'', page 128).

Monster: A powerful supernatural creature lives near the covenant. The creature can be aligned with any realm, and should be too powerful for the player characters to defeat at the beginning of the campaign. This Hook may be Unknown. Circulus Ruber, the oldest covenant in the Hibernian Tribunal, is plagued by a Cailleach, an evil faerie hag who would love to tear the tower down, but cannot breach its Aegis of the Hearth. She takes her frustration out on travelers to and from the covenant (''The Contested Isle'', page 81).

Poverty: The covenant has only one Lesser source of income, with little or no surplus. This may suffice for day to day matters, but resources for major expenses require a story. This Hook can be Unknown, but probably not for very long

'''Protector:''' The covenant is responsible for protecting something, such as a village, a magical grove, or another, weaker, covenant. This Hook may be taken more than once, to represent multiple protectorates.

Regio: There is a regio on the covenant site, although the covenant is not in it. The magi do not know everything that is in the regio.

If the regio is not a Magical regio, being Divine, Faerie, or Infernal, that counts as an additional minor Hook. This Hook can be taken if the covenant is in a regio, in that case, it simply refers to a second regio.

Rival: Someone or some group is working to undermine or stymie the covenant. This rival may be much weaker than the covenant, as long as he is capable of causing problems worthy of stories. This Hook may be Unknown.

Road: The covenant is on an important mundane road, river, or sea route, so that people often turn up at the covenant, bringing or causing stories.

'''Superiors''': The player characters are not in charge of the covenant, and while their superiors cannot order them about the player characters do not have control of covenant resources.

'''Urban:''' The covenant is in a small market town. Many of the inhabitants are not part of the covenant, and the covenant does not rule the town. Schola Pythagoranis, in the Stonehenge Tribunal, is located in the town of Cambridge, and deeply involved with the young university there (see ''Art &amp; Academe'', page 111).

<span id="major-looks"></span>
=== Major Looks ===

Beholden: The covenant owes favors to someone or something, possibly another covenant, or possibly a mundane lord, bishop, or mystical creature. The external party can give the covenant orders, although the covenant gets to decide on the best way to carry them out.

Castle: Castles serve three functions. A castle acts as a refuge from military forces, so it defends territory. A castle acts as a staging ground for armies, so it threatens to assault its neighbors. A castle costs a fortune to create and maintain, and in many places requires the permission of the king to build, so it communicates the status of its owner. A castle, then, is a claim to political power, backed with the threat of force.

A brigade of knights, supported by a castle, can travel about twenty miles in a day. This means they have the ability to raid targets up to ten miles away, and return to barracks before nightfall. All people who live within that radius, or have interests there, will rapidly become aware of the existence of the castle.

The temporal and spiritual authorities of an area cannot ignore a covenant that builds a castle. Covenants that hold castles must either be so secluded that there are no neighboring nobles to alarm, or must come to terms with the secular and religious powers of an area. Covenants provides more detail on the forms that castles can take, but this Hook applies to any structure that the local nobility see as a threat.

Monster: A powerful mystical creature lives inside the covenant. The creature can be aligned with any realm, and should be too powerful for the player characters to defeat at the beginning of the saga.

Mundane Politics: The covenant is deeply ensnared in mundane politics, and must keep the Quaesitores from becoming too interested in their activities.

Poverty: The covenant has no source of income at all, and no mundane resources to speak of. Even providing daily food requires stories. Note that this will set the tone of at least the beginning of the saga.

Regio: There is a regio on the covenant site, although the covenant is not in it. The magi do not know everything that is in the regio, and inhabitants of some sort occasionally come out and cause problems. If the regio is not magical, that counts as an additional Minor Hook.

Rival: Someone or some group is working to destroy the covenant, and has the resources for this to be possible. Thus, the rival must be of comparable power to the covenant. The Scholomance, in the Transylvanian Tribunal, is a school for future apprentices, agents, and companions. However, it is in a regio that is not always accessible, and has gained a reputation as a school for sorcerers, run by the devil himself. A papal legate has been ordered to investigate these rumors, and has established himself in the area (''Against the Dark'', page 91).

Road: The covenant is on an important mystical trail of some kind, so that supernatural creatures, from one or more realms, often turn up at the covenant. The covenant of Didyma, in the Theban Tribunal, is linked to the city of Miletos by the Sacred Way. This is an important mundane road, but also a major route from the faerie realm to the mundane world, and faeries often appear on it (''Through the Aegis'', Chapter 4).

Superiors: The player characters can be given orders by the ranking members of the covenant, which they must obey.

'''Unknown''': An Unknown Hook is taken on by one of the players, who will act as storyguide for that aspect of the saga. The other players have no idea what sort of stories this Hook will generate. This must be something that the characters could realistically be unaware of.

The player who will storyguide the Hook chooses a Minor Hook to be the unknown Hook, but this counts as a Major Hook for the purposes of balancing Boons. Note that, if you do not want to play troupe-style, Unknown Hooks are inappropriate.

'''Urban''': The covenant is in a city. The vast majority of the inhabitants are not part of the covenant, and the covenant does not rule the city.

<span id="boons"></span>
=== Boons ===

Boons are things that make the covenant better. Each Minor Boon costs one point, while a Major Boon costs three points, and they must be paid for with Hooks. They cannot be bought with Build Points.

<span id="minor-boons"></span>
==== Minor Boons ====

Aura: A minor Boon increases the Magic aura of the covenant by one point. The players may take this Boon up to seven times, for a covenant in any Magic aura up to ten. All the covenfolk must live within the aura.

Edifice: An edifice is any major building erected to inspire awe. Covenants rarely need edifices: they could function equally well with many small buildings, made of cheaper and less ornamented materials. Many covenants, however, have at least one, to mark their wealth and power, to beautify their covenant, to arouse the envy of their peers, and to mark their covenant's priorities. Edifices do not require the Castle Hook unless several of them, grouped together, form a structure as threatening as a castle.

The powerful covenant of Aedes Mercurii in the Provençal Tribunal has two sites, one of which is centered on a majestic stone edifice known as the Temple (''Templum''). The other site is carved out of the Pic du Midi d'Ossau, and contains many spectacular chambers (''Faith &amp; Flame'', page 83).

Hidden Resources: The covenant has 250 Build Points of resources that are not immediately available to the player characters. These might actually be lost within the covenant, or be sections of the library that are only open to more highly-ranked magi. This Boon may be taken multiple times.

Important Building: The covenant has an additional large and important building, not mentioned in another Boon. This Boon may be taken multiple times, indicating a new structure each time. These buildings do not normally require the Castle Hook.

Prestige: The covenant, and its members, are well-regarded. This may be as a result of previous actions, such as defeating a monster, or because of continuing features of the covenant, such as a superb library. The covenant has a Reptuation score of 3 (see page 28). This Boon may be taken multiple times, with the prestige applying to a different group each time.

Regio: The covenant is located in a Magical regio which can be entered in several ways. The covenant may take measures to limit entry into the regio, but these are never perfect. The lost covenant of Val Negra, in the Provençal Tribunal, was one of the first covenants of the Order, founded by Flambeau himself, but it suffered greatly in the Schism War and now even its precise location is lost. It is generally believed to have been in a regio, and to

have been lost because people forgot how to enter it (''Faith &amp; Flame'', Chapter 9).

Seclusion: The covenant is in a very remote location, and very rarely gets visitors. This Boon cannot be taken in conjunction with the Road or Urban Hooks, and may be inappropriate for other Hooks. Redcaps still come to the covenant; this Boon restricts the number of random visitors.

Shell Keep (requires Castle): The shell keep is a modification of the motte and bailey castle. A motte is an artificial mound of earth, between ten and one hundred feet tall, on which a wooden tower is built. This tower overlooks and defends a courtyard that is surrounded by a ditch, embankment and wooden palisade. This courtyard is called the bailey. Some noblemen still build motte and bailey castles in 1220, although Hermetic magi rarely do.

Most motte and bailey castles have been strengthened since their creation with stonework. A problem for a nobleman planning improvements is that the motte dominates the bailey, and so cannot be ignored, but is not strong enough to hold a stone tower keep of the style found in more modern castles. They usually build a shell keep.

A shell keep is a stone wall, usually two stories high, that replaces the wooden palisade atop the motte. The wall is thin compared to other fortifications, between eight and fifteen feet, and has a crenelated walkway. Some structures like this are so large that it is not clear if they are a shell keep or a small inner bailey: Restormel in Cornwall is 40 yards across. Within its ring, buildings are constructed. These are usually wooden, or thin stone, and lack defensive use, but are far more spacious, airy and comfortable to live in than those of a conventional keep. The center of the ring of buildings is usually a courtyard.

The wooden palisade around the bailey has also been replaced, by a thick stone wall about thirty feet high. This has a crenelated walk. Entry to the castle now lies through the lowest story of a square tower, two stories high.

Tower Keep (requires Castle): Most tower keeps were built during the twelfth century and are, generally, four stories high and square or rectangular. Entry is via an external stairway to the second floor. The keep is usually topped with crenelated battlements. Newer keeps may be polygonal or, most recently, round in plan.

As an example of size, the two largest keeps of each type in Britain are Pembroke and Colchester. Pembroke is 80 feet high, 53 feet in diameter and has walls 16 feet thick at the base. Colchester's keep is 151 feet long, 111 feet wide and over three stories high. Covenants that have works on this scale, which are relatively simple with Hermetic magic, will awe the local nobility.

The great tower of the covenant is surrounded by a courtyard, which contains wooden or stone buildings of no tactical value. The courtyard's wall is made of thick stone, and is about thirty feet high. It

is topped with a crenelated walk. A small tower, two stories high, defends the gate.

Wealth: The covenant is wealthy, even by the standards of other magi and the nobility. One existing Typical source of income is upgraded to Greater, providing enough money for the magi and covenfolk to live very comfortably, with a large surplus for spending on luxuries.

<span id="major-boons"></span>
=== Major Boons ===

Aura: The aura of a limited area of the covenant increases by one point. It is only worth taking this if the aura of the whole covenant is already 5, as this then allows the covenfolk to live and work mostly outside the level 6 (or higher) aura, and thus avoid Warping. The covenant of Hedyosmos, in the Theban Tribunal, is built in a labyrinth of caves of steadily increasing Magic aura. Rumor has it that there is a gateway to the Magic Realm, the Underworld, or both in the strongest area of the aura. The magi of the covenant are famed for their mastery of magic of the earth, the dead, and curses, and light and speech are forbidden in common areas, giving the covenant a sinister reputation (''The Sundered Eagle'', page 66).

Curtain Walls and Mural Towers (requires Castle): A curtain wall is a crenelated wall around the bailey. The wall is around thirty feet high and between eight and twenty feet thick. It has an exterior of dressed stones and is filled with a rubble core. Mural towers protect a curtain wall.

Most mural towers built before 1200 are square in cross-section. Round and semicircular towers are the preferred types for contemporary building. Most towers are enclosed buildings, but some, particularly semicircular towers, have no masonry on the inside face, so that if they are captured, they do not provide the enemy with cover. Others are closed until they reach the level of the parapet, and are then open.

There are many covenants where the towers are badly sited, and many more where each tower is so filled with personal material that it impedes defense. Some castles have towers as far from the obvious avenue of attack as possible. This is because the towers were built before crossbows became popular weapons of siegecraft: they are intended as residences, and so have been placed away from harm.

The Bell Tower built at Dover Castle in 1189 exemplifies an opposite extreme, the archery tower. It is an octagonal, three story tower. Each story has six positions for crossbowmen, with the other sides used for a stairwell and a latrine. During peace, the tower is used for storage and to barrack its crossbowmen. A tower like this could not be used as a sanctum, unless the magus was willing to have his laboratory removed swiftly as enemies approached.

Magi understand that their desire to claim a tower on the curtain wall can seriously impair the castle's effectiveness. Many covenants compromise between the residential and military possibilities of the tower, by having the lowest floor designed as a foxhole and filled only with those materials easily removed or destroyed, and the roof used as a sentry post and sniper's nest.

A covenant designed with this Boon has as many mural towers as suits the troupe. Framlingham has thirteen towers, including two for its gate, while other castles built at the same time are rectangular baileys with a fat tower at each corner and two at the gate. There are two disadvantages to having a dozen towers: they are expensive to build, maintain and garrison, and they declare to all of your neighbors that you expect to rule the county someday. Every extra tower makes a castle more difficult to ignore.

This Boon includes one of the minor keep Boons given earlier (shell or tower).

The covenant of Montverte in the Normandy Tribunal occupies such a castle, and uses it as a base for raiding, as permitted by the Peripheral Code of that tribunal. They share the castle with its mundane lord, an arrangement that draws great suspicion. So far, however, the magi have managed to convince the Tribunal that they do not interfere in the lord's mundane affairs (''The Lion and the Lily'', page 58).

Prestige: The covenant is famous. Its members are well-treated, as far as the Cift permits, and people are reluctant to cross the covenant openly. Within the Order, this would apply to domus magnae, or to the oldest and most powerful covenants. A covenant that repeatedly aided and defended its mundane neighbors could get such a reputation in the mundane world, although that level of activity would draw the attention of the Quaesitores. The covenant has a Reputation score of 9 (see page 28). This Boon may be taken several times, with the prestige applying to a different group each time.

Regio: The covenant is located in a Magical regio which can only be entered if people are guided by a native. The oppidum of Tablinum, in the Transylvanian Tribunal, is a storehouse of information and artefacts under the control of House Tremere. It exists in numerous regiones, which can only be entered by the use of spells, all of which require the possession of an Arcane Connection to the regio in question. Fortunately, the head of the oppidum, known as the curator (currently Nestor of Tremere) has a collection of these Arcane Connections (''Against the Dark'', page 58).

Wealth: The covenant is fabulously wealthy. One existing Typical source of income is upgraded to Legendary, providing enough money for the most sumptuous of quarters and the purchase of the most expensive materials and equipment. Such fortunate magi can live in kingly luxury, as can the covenfolk.

| The Covenfolk are deeply unhappy, and only remain with the covenant out of fear of retribution. They are on the verge of revolt, and are likely to complain to the nobility or the clergy over the treatment they have received at the hands of the magi. If they do so, they will mention the involvement of dark magic. The average servant or grog is surly and uncommunicative, and obeys a magus only under threat of violence. Productivity (in terms of cost-saving measures and income which relies upon covenfolk) of the covenant is halved due to desertion and rebellion.

| The Covenfolk as a whole are not happy working for the magi, but it is a steady form of employment, and their immediate needs are cared for; so self-interest keeps them in place. They do not believe that their masters will help them if they get into trouble, and have no illusions over their own position in the covenant.
|-

| The Covenfolk will not betray their masters under most circumstances, unless offered an appropriate inducement. Knowing that if the covenant fails they will lose their home and sustenance is usually enough to keep them in line. They are still wary around the magi.

| The Covenfolk are moderately content. They have learned to ignore the social penalty of The Gift of their masters in the main, and treat them as they would normally treat a member of the gentry.

| The Covenfolk go to extraordinary lengths in the service of their masters; it is not unknown for a grog to lay down his life for one. Covenant productivity is increased as the covenfolk go about their daily tasks with zeal. At this level of loyalty, the magi of the covenant are treated as near gods, and there is probably a great deal of superstition and ritual associated with daily life.

<span id="covenant-loyalty"></span>
== Covenant Loyalty ==

he mundane members of a covenant do not necessarily feel any strong loyalty towards it. They live and work there, and so they have a vested interest in its

success, but they could have a wide range of feelings towards the resident magi. The effects of The Gift mean that most new residents at a covenant have serious doubts about the rulers of their home. For game purposes, this is captured by Prevailing Loyalty, the average 'Loyal to Covenant' Personality Trait of the covenant's servants, specialists and soldiers. It is determined by the social penalty of The Gift of the covenant's magi, the governance style of the covenant, and the individual actions of the magi. Its score determines how loyal the average member of the covenant is towards the ruling council and the covenant as a whole; this quantity also reflects the general morale of the covenant, and the willingness of the average member to act for the good or ill of its residents. More details on Prevailing Loyalty are given in Covenants (pages 36–41).

The 'Loyal to Covenant' Personality Trait of any individual within the covenant (such as a grog) can vary by up to three points either way from the average Prevailing Loyalty of the covenant, although in general a player character may choose any Loyal to Covenant value they wish. However, if this score is dramatically different from that of the covenant, taking a Personality Flaw to account for this difference is appropriate.

<span id="qalculating-prevailing-loyalty"></span>
== Qalculating Prevailing Loyalty ==

To calculate Prevailing Loyalty, calculate the total modifier for each magus in the covenant as given in the nearby table, then divide by the number of magi in the covenant.

Base Loyalty =

total of Gift modifiers /number of magi

Make a note of this Base Loyalty, for if the membership of the covenant changes, adjustments will need to be made to Base Loyalty without affecting any later modifications in loyalty due to player actions. The total loyalty points are

calculated by applying modifiers to the Base Loyalty according to the environment of the covenant, their treatment by the magi, and the actions of the members of the council. Total loyalty points are converted into a Prevailing Loyalty score using the Advancement table for Abilities (ignoring any negative sign).

== Modifying Loyalty Due to Covenant Situation ==

Loyalty points are gained and lost for the equipment and provender given to the covenfolk; however, all of these things eat into the resources of the covenant. The covenant might offer better wages than is normal, or continue to care for retired members of their turb, in the manner of the Romans, by providing a pension. If the covenfolk have to work with inferior equipment, this impacts on loyalty, but likewise, soldiers given brand-new weapons and armor are more loyal than those who have to steal from vanquished enemies. Living conditions, which are determined by the local environment, also influence loyalty. Finally, competent specialists put in charge of the covenfolk increase loyalty through diligence and hard work. The covenant can employ up to three specialists who deal with the covenfolk on their behalf, rather than dealing with them directly. The turb captain mediates between the magi and the grogs, the steward mediates between the magi and the specialists and the chamberlain mediates between the magi and the servants. A single individual may perform up to two of these tasks (commonly steward and chamberlain), such a person is often called the autocrat. In this case, add

loyalty points for

both roles.

Covenfolk gradually grow used to the magi with whom they live; more specifically, they grow to ignore the social penalty of The Gift. This only applies to the magi of the home covenant; 'foreign' Gifted individuals suffer the usual suspicion and distrust. Over longer periods of time, covenfolk are born into the covenant, and thus grow up familiar with their magi. For every year that a covenant exists it gains two loyalty points. The maximum number of points that can be gained through Familiarity is equal to the base loyalty points of the covenant (that is, those imposed by The Gift of the magi).

<span id="changing-loyalty-due-to-actions--svents"></span>
== Changing Loyalty Due to Actions &amp; Svents ==

The actions of the magi may have an effect on the loyalty of the other members of the covenant. Unfortunately, it is easier for magi to reduce the loyalty of the covenfolk than to increase it. The nearby insert gives some examples of actions that might reduce Prevailing Loyalty. The column for Local Events reflects the fact that the magi are also blamed for events that are outside their control; the covenfolk may well believe that the magi could have prevented any problem.

These penalties should only be applied for events that happen in play, or that the players agree happened offstage. If the players choose not to describe something, it was not important enough to affect loyalty.

Loyalty can also be increased by the actions of the magi, if they personally do things that benefit the covenfolk. This is particularly true if the magi use obvious magic to benefit them. Use the penalty guidelines to judge how many points should be awarded. If one magus deliberately undoes damage inflicted by another magus, that might well avoid any effect on Prevailing Loyalty, although the covenfolk may come to have different attitudes to those magi.

Local events only increase loyalty if the magi are clearly responsible for them, most likely through the use of magic.

<span id="the-mythic-pound"></span>
== The Mythic Pound ==

Prices in this chapter are quoted in Mythic Pounds. This conveniently ignores the fact that Mythic Europe consists of a multitude of different realms with different coinages, whose relative value may be subject to significant variation. City and Guild and the Tribunal books contain more information on local currencies, but most sagas do not need that much detail.

One Mythic Pound is equivalent to a pound of silver, the annual income of a typical peasant, or enough money to maintain an average Hermetic laboratory for a year.

ovenants almost always need some source of mundane wealth to obtain things like food and clothing. Even those that are entirely self-sufficient have a

source of mundane wealth — it just provides food and clothing directly. It is entirely possible to play the game while leaving these matters entirely in the background, but this section is for troupes that want a bit more detail in the finances of the covenant, so that they can tell stories about increasing its wealth, or about dealing with threats to its mundane income. The Covenants supplement has a lot more detail on this topic, and City and Guild provides more general rules and background for craft and trading that covenants could also use to make money.

<span id="income"></span>
== Income ==

Most covenants have a single source of income, although some have diversified with two or more distinct sources, and impoverished covenants have none. Broadly speaking, a source of income is a single large enterprise which provides a significant portion (usually most or all) of the covenant's income. For the sake of simplicity, a group of related enterprises (for example, agricultural land with a variety of crops, or a trading business with multiple trade routes plus incomes from rent) can be counted as a single source. It is probably not

worth accounting for any trivial sources of income (for example, selling surplus honey for a few shillings at the local market), unless they provide several pounds or more per year. Each source of income comes in one of four categories, specifying broadly how much income it provides (see insert).

== Baseline ==

The base for covenant creation (a standard covenant with no Hooks or Boons relating to income) is a single Typical source of income. An alternative base option is to take two Lesser

sources of income instead of one Typical source. (Although this provides a lower total income, there are benefits to such diversity. Should one source of income fail, the covenant has a backup, plus there are double the opportunities for income growth and for stories.)

This provides a fairly modest income by Hermetic standards (although a considerable sum by mundane standards), usually enough to cover the covenant's expenses. Unless a relevant Hook is taken, the source of income may be assumed to be mostly stable and discreet — something that the magi will not need to frequently concern themselves with. The annual income of 100 pounds is just a guideline, and assumes an averagesized covenant of about six magi. If your covenant has more magi, you may wish to adjust the income upwards by 15 pounds per additional magus. Likewise, if you have fewer magi, you may reduce the income by the same amount. For a covenant with only one Lesser source of income. the adjustment should be only six pounds per magus. If need be, you may also tweak the starting income relative to the starting yearly expenditure, so that at the start of the saga, the desired surplus or deficit is attained. Probably you will want to start the saga with the covenant having a small annual surplus, say 10 pounds or so, enough to cover a modicum of sundry expenses.

<span id="sources-of-income"></span>
=== Sources of Income ===

The following sources of income can serve as inspiration for your covenant. ''Covenants'' contains more detail on all of these options, and any source can supply any level of income.

Agriculture: The foundation of medieval society, and unlikely to cause conflict unless the covenant has no right to the land it is using.

Charity: Someone is giving the covenant money, which is great, as long as they do not stop.

Crime: Hermetic magic can support some very effective robbers, and maybe the covenant can play (or even be — this is about the right period) Robin Hood.

Fishing: The watery equivalent of agriculture, and also unlikely to cause conflict.

Forestry: In addition to selling the wood, the magi might hunt and harvest the animals of the forest.

Hospitality: The covenant provides food, drink, and shelter to wealthy travelers.

Livestock: Cattle, sheep, and horses can all be raised to provide income.

Manufacturing: If the covenant employs enough craftsmen, it can make goods for sale.

Mining: Metals, salt, and coal are good, if unglamorous, sources of income. Dressed stone can also be sold. Gold or silver mines are spectacular, but may draw unwelcome attention.

Money: If the covenant has money already, it can invest or lend it to make more. The Church often disapproves of this, unfortunately.

Service: Skilled covenfolk might be able to sell their skills to others, everything from entertainers to mercenaries.

Toll-Gathering: A covenant that controls an important route can charge people to use it.

Trade: This involves moving goods from somewhere they are cheap to somewhere they are expensive, and selling them there.

Wizardry: Wizards can sell the products of their magic. This is looked down upon by many magi, and the Quaesitores may take an interest it, but handled well it can make a lot of money for relatively little effort.

<span id="expenditure"></span>
== '''Expenditure''' ==

The successful running of a covenant requires a multitude of different supplies and goods, which, if the covenant does not produce them itself, need to be purchased. At the most basic level, there is the need to feed, clothe, and shelter the covenfolk, and to provide laboratory equipment and writing materials for the magi. Beyond that, the grogs need weapons and armor, the defenses need to be maintained, luxury items might be purchased, construction may be undertaken, travel and hospitality need to be paid for, and so on. Even for a small spring covenant, these costs can easily amount to 50 pounds per year; larger covenants may spend five or even ten times that much.

To start with, you should determine the normal yearly expenditure of the covenant — the costs of the things which are the same every year. First, you need to determine how many people of each type live at the covenant (see the Covenfolk Categories section below). Then, total up the number of points of inhabitants, weapons and armor, and laboratories, and determine the cost in each category of expenditure listed below, or refer to the Yearly Expenditure summary. This total usually remains static unless the point totals change (for example, the covenant employs more covenfolk, or the magi upgrade their labs).

Every year, there is also at least one pound's worth (usually considerably more) of sundry expenses — one-off items of expenditure, such as travel, or the purchase of books. More details of such exceptional expenses can be found in ''Covenants'' and ''City and Guild''. These extra costs should be noted, totaled at the end of the year, and added to the normal yearly expenditure to give you that year's total expenditure. Subtract this from the income for the year, and add any surplus to (or if there is a shortfall, subtract it from) the covenant's stores.

<span id="covenfolk-categories"></span>
== Covenfolk Categories ==

For the purposes of accounting, the covenfolk (that is, everyone living at the covenant apart from magi and companions) should be separated into the following categories. (For characters that have a dual vocation, simply pick the most appropriate category.)

Craftsmen: People with a Craft Ability, employed by the covenant to practice their craft and produce wares for the covenant, such as a smith, a carpenter, or a weaver. Craftsmen allow for cost savings in one or more categories of expenditure — the covenant does not need to spend so much on buying wares from outside. The exceptions are book-binders and illuminators, who do not save costs, but instead allow the covenant to produce quality books.

Dependents: Residents supported by the covenant who do no useful work, such as children, idle spouses, the infirm, and retirees. Children should only be counted from the age of five onwards (children younger than five can be assumed to consume a negligible amount of resources). Once they are old enough to work, children can be moved to another category.

Grogs: Full-time soldiers whose primary vocation is the martial defense of the covenant and its magi.

Laborers: Workers who gather food for the covenant, such as farmhands, herders, fishermen, or hunters. Laborers allow for cost saving on Provisions, since the covenant does not need to buy so much food.

Servants: Essential folk who prepare and serve the food, clean, and perform other household tasks, such as maids, cooks, bakers, errand-boys, stablehands, and the like.

Specialists: Individuals who occupy some important role in the hierarchy of running the covenant, such as an autocrat, a steward, a chamberlain, a turb captain, or a scribe. Hermetic apprentices also count as specialists.

Teamsters: People who are employed to procure provisions and supplies from elsewhere and transport them to the covenant, typically one or more market buyers and a team of wagoners or hauliers. Some covenants are served by traveling merchants, in which case the teamsters do not belong to the covenant. However they still need to be paid and accounted for, since it is more expensive to buy wares on your doorstep than to travel to market and buy them there — either way, the covenant has to bear the haulage costs.

You may employ as many or as few of each type of covenfolk as you like, except that there is a minimum required number of servants and teamsters. There is also a limit to the number of laborers and craftsmen that can be usefully employed (see the Cost Saving section below).

To determine the minimum number of servants and teamsters for your covenant, proceed as follows: Total up the points of inhabitants (see insert), including everyone ''except'' laborers, servants, and teamsters. For every 10 points of this total, you need 2 servants. Add the points for these servants to the total. Now, subtract ''twice'' the

Do not include characters of independent means who pay for their own upkeep, nor any characters who work for one of the covenant's sources of income. By sacrificing their privileged lifestyle (and the better Living Conditions Modifier), impoverished magi may reduce their point cost to 3. By adopting the same privileges as standard covenfolk (the same food, wages, and living quarters), magi and companions may even reduce their point cost to 2.

Take the total of the points for all the laboratories in the covenant. For an Upkeep score of between –5 (the lowest possible) and +5, the number of points per laboratory is as specified in the above table. For example, a standard laboratory (Upkeep 0) equates to 10 points. Beyond +5, the number of extra points gained per level of Upkeep increase is equal to the new Upkeep score times ten. For example, increasing the Upkeep from +5 to +6 increases the number of points by 60 (+6 multiplied by ten), taking it from 150 to 210. Thus, for a laboratory with an Upkeep of +2 or greater, the number of points is equal to ten times the number of experience points needed to buy an Art score with the same

value as the Upkeep, as specified in the Advancement Table, page 375. For example, a lab with an Upkeep of +15 equates to 1200 points, ten times the cost of an Art score of 15 (120 experience points). There is no upper limit on an Upkeep score, except the covenant's ability to pay for it!

<span id="yearly-expenditure-categories"></span>
== Yearly Expenditure Categories ==

The regular expenditure of the covenant can be divided into the following categories. It is worth noting that the Buildings, Consumables, Provisions, and Wages totals usually sum to exactly one pound per point of inhabitants, and form the bulk of the expenditure. Thus, a very rough rule of thumb is that a covenant can afford a number of points of inhabitants equal to its income in pounds, provided it has a moderate amount of cost saving.

== Buildings ==

The covenant's buildings need to be properly maintained, decorated, and furnished, to prevent them from falling into disrepair. For example, damaged roofing and stonework has to be patched up, old furniture might need to be replaced and there are often plenty of minor repair jobs for a carpenter to do.

Buildings cost:

1 pound for every 10 points of inhabitants.

Add 2 pounds for any Minor Boon, and 5 pounds for any Major Boon, that adds to the size, magnificence, or quantity of the covenant's buildings or fortifications.

<span id="consumables"></span>
=== Consumables ===

There are a whole host of minor tools, equipment, and consumables that are necessary for the smooth running of a covenant, which need to be replenished and repaired, including candles, carts, clothing, fuel, kitchen utensils, barrels, brooms, and so on. Special materials required for books and laboratories are accounted for separately.

Consumables cost:

2 pounds for every 10 points of inhabitants.

<span id="inflation"></span>
==== Inflation ====

Most covenants have a gradually corrosive effect on their local economy and the magi would be wise to be careful how they spend their money, to avoid inflating the prices of the things they need to buy.

The effects of inflation can be crudely modeled by simply adding a flat cost in pounds to the yearly expenditure. In the covenant's first year, the inflation cost should be zero. As a rule of thumb, it is suggested that it increase by one pound per hundred pounds of expenditure every year, although in favorable years (if there is a good harvest, for example) the inflation may not rise, or in bad years (perhaps when the magi have spent profligately, for example) it may increase by several pounds. Also, it is suggested that the inflation not increase during a year in which the covenant's expenditure drops (for example, as a result of new cost saving measures).

<span id="laboratories"></span>
== Laboratories ==

Unsurprisingly, magi are willing to spend a significant portion of their money on their own laboratories. To maintain a laboratory at its existing level requires a steady supply of replacement equipment (especially glassware) and precious ingredients, as well as more basic items, such as fuel for heating and candles for lighting. The cost for each laboratory depends on its

Upkeep score (see Chapter 8: Laboratory). For example, a standard laboratory (with an Upkeep of 0) costs one pound per year of typical use.

Laboratories cost:

1 pound per 10 points of laboratories.

<span id="provisions"></span>
==== Provisions ====

With usually many dozens of mouths to feed, one of the covenant's major items of expenditure, often the largest of all, is the purchase of foodstuffs. A typical covenant consumes grains, meat, fish, vegetables, cheese, spices, salt, ale, and wines, and needs fodder for its horses.

PROVISIONS COST:

5 pounds for every 10 points of inhabitants.

<span id="tithes"></span>
==== Tithes ====

Some covenants need to regularly pay off their masters, just like many folk in medieval Europe. Such yearly payments might take the form of a tithe to another covenant, taxes to a feudal overlord or the Church, or debt repayments. The amount of these obligations is determined by the situation of the covenant, and development of the saga.

<span id="cages"></span>
=== Cages ===

Covenfolk are not usually paid a daily wage; they instead receive food and lodging in return for their service. Nevertheless, it is common for them to be given a modest weekly or monthly stipend, so that they may occasionally buy things for themselves. For example, a grog in a typical Spring covenant might get one penny per week, enough to buy a dozen mugs of ale. Although magi do not get paid wages per se, they nevertheless often have some kind of allowance for discretionary personal spending. This caters for minor purchases such as clothing, jewelry, and the like, which need not be accounted for separately. The &quot;wages&quot; for horses can be assumed to be spent on the extra food which they require.

You may adjust these wage costs as appropriate for your covenant, but bear in mind that the more you pay them, the happier the covenfolk will be (and vice-versa). The standard wage costs listed here make no adjustment to Loyalty, if you increase (or reduce) them, you may gain the benefits (or penalties) to Loyalty as outlined earlier.

WAGES COST:

2 pounds for every 10 points of inhabitants.

(This is equivalent to one penny per point of inhabitants, per week.) Add 1 pound per each penny that is paid daily to any professional soldiers in the covenant's service.

<span id="ceapons-and-armor"></span>
== Ceapons and Armor ==

Almost all covenants have a turb of warriors, who are outfitted with weaponry and armor, and some have an additional store of weapons, or even an arsenal. This equipment needs to be regularly cleaned, repaired, and (every so often) replaced. However for a small turb with modest outfitting, this cost is likely to amount to only a couple of pounds per year.

Weapons and armor cost: 1 pound for every 320 points of weapons and armor.

<span id="criting-materials"></span>
=== '''Criting''' Materials ===

Writing is a costly business, since parchment and inks are expensive. As a rule of thumb, one pound provides enough materials for the writing of four books, without embellishment. Typically, a magus uses such a quantity in one year. For example, two seasons of labwork (in which a Lab Text is produced), one season of book writing, plus diaries, accounts, records, letters, and so on, would amount to this much. Writing costs can be reduced for magi who are absent from the covenant or undertake little labwork or scribing, however. Specialist craftsmen (scribes, binders, illuminators) allow better quality books to be produced, but add to the production costs (see Covenants for detailed rules). Precious materials used for resonant bonuses on books are more expensive still, but are counted as sundry expenses (see earlier), on a case-by-case basis.

Writing materials cost:

1 pound for every magus, scribe, bookbinder, or illuminator.

<span id="cost-saving"></span>
== Cost Saving ==

There are three main ways in which a covenant may be able to reduce its expenditure (apart from scrimping or laying off staff): by employing laborers, by employing craftsmen, and by utilizing magical items (or Ritual spells) which substitute for the work of one or more humans. The benefits of adding laborers and craftsmen are threefold: Firstly, there is a modest net saving in overall expenditure. Secondly, by producing more of its food and wares locally, the covenant becomes more resistant to crises caused by any interruptions to its outside supplies. Lastly, by adding more points of inhabitants, the cost saving limits (as detailed below) increase in real terms, allowing the covenant to exploit economies of scale. For example, adding laborers actually allows you to potentially make greater use of your existing craftsmen, who find themselves with more work to do, such as creating and repairing the tools used by the laborers.

<span id="laborers"></span>
==== Laborers ====

Each laborer working for the covenant reduces expenditure on Provisions by one pound. (As detailed above, every five laborers also makes one teamster redundant, indirectly saving one pound.) The maximum amount of money which can be saved by laborers is half of the Provisions total. A covenant with craftsmen producing foodstuffs can save more money on Provisions, as described below, possibly all of it if there are enough different types of sufficiently skilled craftsmen.

<span id="oraftsmen"></span>
=== '''Oraftsmen''' ===

Craftsmen employed by the covenant come in two types. Common craftsmen, such as blacksmiths, leatherworkers, and brewers, are those found in almost every village of any size in Mythic Europe, and are relatively easy to come by. Rare craftsmen, such as glassblowers, goldsmiths, and percamenarii (who make parchment) have a much more specialized trade and are encountered less frequently. They are harder to find and recruit, but are consequently more highly valued by a covenant. A common craftsman reduces expenditure by a number of pounds equal to one plus half of his Craft Ability, rounded down. For example, a craftsman with an Ability score of five saves three pounds. A rare craftsman reduces expenditure by a number of pounds equal to his Craft Ability. Craftsmen may save money in various categories of expenditure, as detailed in the insert. For each category, there is a limit to the amount of savings that can be achieved with each

particular craft. For example, a typical covenant with 100 points of inhabitants spends 20 pounds per year on Consumables, before cost saving. At most 20% of this (four pounds) can be saved in any one craft. Thus, no matter how many blacksmiths the covenant has (or how skilled they are), the maximum which can be saved by blacksmithing alone is four pounds. However, the covenant could (potentially) save its entire spending on Consumables by employing at least five different relevant types of craftsmen. In some cases, you may wish to make common-sense adjustments to the cost-saving limits. For example, if only a handful of your grogs carry bows, the cost-saving limit for a bowyer should be much less than 50% of the Weapons and Armor expenditure.

<span id="magic"></span>
=== Magic ===

Magic can also be employed to save money. For example, the fertility of the covenant's lands may be improved, or the magi might magically create tools or lab equipment, instead of purchasing them. A magical item might reduce the Consumables costs, for example, an oven which requires no fuel. Alternatively, it might save on labor, for example, a broom which sweeps by itself. In the former case, one or more pounds is saved directly; in the latter case, you can achieve the same results with fewer covenfolk (thus saving money indirectly). The minimum required numbers of servants and teamsters may thus be reduced. Magical items can also perform the work of laborers and craftsmen, and may be treated as such for the purposes of cost-saving. As a very simple rule of thumb, each magnitude of effect in such items can save one pound per year. Each casting of a Ritual spell may save approximately five pounds per magnitude, although this depends on the nature of the effect (and the discretion of the storyguide). Although Ritual spells may make dramatic improvements, such as creating a barnful of grain, they are somewhat rarely employed, since most magi value the necessary vis at more than five pounds per pawn. At the storyguide's discretion, non-ritual Rego craft spells, if cast repeatedly over an extended period, may save money as per magic items.

<span id="emergency-savings"></span>
== Emergency Savings ==

Sometimes, a covenant will find itself out of money (or credit), with its expenditure exceeding its income. If it cannot suddenly increase its cashflow, it will need to reduce its outgoings. There are a number of possibilities, which are a good source of stories. As detailed in the Points of Inhabitants insert above, the more privileged members of the covenant may voluntarily dispense with some of their perks and luxuries. (The points of magi or companions may be reduced to less than 5 or 3 points, respectively,

<span id="expenditure---a-simple-example"></span>
== Expenditure - A Simple Example ==

Vernus is a typical starting spring covenant. It consists of 6 magi (30 points), 4 companions (12 points), 3 specialists — a chamberlain, a steward, and a turb captain (6 points), 10 grogs (10 points), and no dependents, laborers, or craftsmen, for a provisional total of 58 points. It thus needs 12 servants (12 points), taking the total to 70 points. Finally, it also needs 7 teamsters (7 points), giving a final total of 77 points of inhabitants (from 42 people). It has 60 points of laboratories (6 standard laboratories) and 320 points of weapons and armor (Standard cost outfitting for each grog — full armor, a shield, and three weapons).

It has '''no''' cost savings at all (purchasing everything it needs) and its Yearly Expenditure is as follows:

Buildings + Consumables

* Provisions + Wages: 77 pounds

Inflation: 0 pounds

Laboratories: 6 pounds

Weapons and Armor: 1 pound

Writing Materials: 6 pounds

Total: 90 pounds

After 10 years of expansion, Vernus has acquired a small plot of farmland and has added 20 laborers (farmhands and huntsmen), 6 craftsmen (4 of various common types with a Craft Ability of 6 which produce wares for the covenant, plus a bookbinder

covenfolk starve, which will likely cause

severe penalties to Loyalty.

and an illuminator who do not provide cost savings), 10 more grogs, and has acquired 10 dependents. Thus it now has 6 magi (30 points), 4 companions (12 points), 3 specialists (6 points), 20 grogs (20 points), 6 craftsmen (12 points), and 10 dependents (10 points), for a provisional total of 90 points. It thus needs 18 servants (18 points), taking the total to 108 points. Subtracting twice the number of laborers (2*20 = 40) from this gives 68, so 7 teamsters (7 points) are needed. Adding these, plus the 20 laborers (20 points), gives a final total of 135 points of inhabitants (from 94 people). It still has 60 points of laboratories but now has 640 points of weapons and armor.

Its Yearly Expenditure (before cost savings) is now as follows:

Buildings + Consumables

* Provisions + Wages: 135 pounds

Inflation: 10 pounds Laboratories: 6 pounds

Weapons and Armor: 2 pounds Writing Materials: 8 pounds Its Cost Savings are as follows:

Laborers: –20 pounds Craftsmen: –16 pounds Total: 125 pounds

<span id="the-organization-of-covenfolk"></span>
= The Organization of Covenfolk =

he organization of grogs in a covenant may have been arranged when the covenant was founded and reorganized deliberately as the covenant

grew in size, or it may have developed organically over its history. This section presents a few concepts around which a covenant organization can be built. Naturally it is possible to mix-and-match; for example, a covenant's soldiers might be organized in a hierarchical fashion, but its servants and specialists might be divided into nations. The manner in which the grogs are organized can be an important determiner of the mood and feel of a covenant, and the troupe should put a bit of thought into which system they prefer. These questions, and the lives of covenfolk more generally, are discussed in greater detail in Grogs, Chapter Two.

<span id="mierarchy"></span>
== Mierarchy ==

A hierarchical organization of a covenant's grogs is perhaps the most commonly found. It is the least work for the magi, as they have a small number of officials reporting to them, who then marshal their subordinates to complete the tasks at hand. The two most significant hierarchical models adopted are those of the noble household and the military.

<span id="a-noble-household"></span>
== A Noble household ==

Covenants who employ a large number of servants and specialists often adopt an organizational structure that mimics that of the noble household. This is a natural model to adopt, since examples of how well it functions can be found throughout Mythic Europe. However, this level of complexity is only really needed if the covenant is a large one, or is masquerading as a lord of the manor. At its most basic level this organization approximates the norm for covenants since the three chief officials in a noble household are the steward, the chamberlain, and the marshal.

The steward (or seneschal) is in control of the lord's lands and the keep, and is often a knight.

The steward sometimes has an under-steward called the steward of the household, or fills this role himself in smaller households. Any miscellaneous specialists, such as craftsmen employed directly by the household, fall under the steward's purview.

The chamberlain (or treasurer, or wardrober) is the chief clerical officer, and is occasionally a subordinate of the steward. The wardrobe is a special room where valuables are kept, and serves as the noble's treasury.

The marshal is the leader of the household knights or men-at-arms. He is also in charge of the horses and needs of the stables. In some households, he is considered subordinate to the steward, but in most covenants using this model, this is not true.

More information on the disposition of a noble household is given in Lords of Men.

<span id="military-hierarchy"></span>
=== Military Hierarchy ===

Rather than dividing the covenfolk by role, a covenant can take a more military approach. In this organizational system, the covenfolk are divided into squads, each of which consists of soldiers and their auxiliary staff. An army in Mythic Europe is largely free of intermediate ranks. The marshal is in charge of his lord's household troops, including the knights and menat-arms. If his lord goes to war, the marshal takes charge of the men-at-arms, while the lord commands the knights; otherwise, he leads the knights himself (in lieu of the tenant-in-chief, thus the later rank &quot;lieutenant&quot;) and appoints a captain to command the men-at-arms.

This model is appropriate for military-minded covenants, but not necessarily only them. In a similar way to dividing covenfolk into nations (see later), this structure can fill a role where, for example, the covenant is divided over several geographically separate sites. The difference to the system of nations is that, in a military hierarchy, each squad is not independent of each other.

Example: Traditional covenants like to follow the early Roman model, where the manus (&quot;hand,&quot; singular and plural), comprised of a squad of four men plus their leader (the quincurion), is the basic unit. A decuria is made of two manus, with the leader of one manus, the decurion, superior to the other. Up to 10 decuriae make up the centuria, commanded by a centurion.

<span id="nations"></span>
== '''Nations''' ==

Another method of organizing grogs is by nation. A nation of grogs consists of servants, specialists, and soldiers — possibly even companions and magi. The identifying feature of a nation is that it cuts across roles. One's nation may be determined by a number of methods. Sometimes new

members are assigned at random, either by lot or in order to fill gaps in the ranks. Otherwise, a recruit might join the nation of the person (magus or otherwise) who inducted him into covenant life. Alternatively, the nations themselves might decide, holding an auction or contest whenever new recruits join the covenant, perhaps having recruits be members of no nation until sufficient numbers of unplaced grogs are accrued. Finally, recruits could be born to a nation, either as the child of a grog, or a member of a specific ethnic group.

Nation-level organizations are common in covenants where magi are relatively independent of each other. Each nation might be dedicated to the service of a single magus, or led by a companion instead. Members of nations often have a Loyalty Personality Trait specific to the nation as well as to the covenant.

The most natural nations form around familial bonds. Old covenants, in particular, have covenfolk who were born in the covenant and have served the magi all their lives. These families can stretch back generations, each one tracing its ancestry back to one of the original servants of the covenant, or even one of the magi. Alternatively, a covenant might, at its foundation, have incorporated folk from the local area who were already strongly divided along family lines.

The student bodies of some universities in Mythic Europe are divided into nations, with each nation responsible for the conduct and protection of each of its members (Art &amp; Academe, page 94). These nations are usually loose geographical groups; the closest ethnic groups are well represented, whereas more distant students are lumped into much wider categories. Some covenants, particularly ones that straddle borders or have been formed from the merging of two or more turbs with distinct racial identities, use this structure.

Nations may also form where a covenant is split over several geographically separated sites, or has deliberate spatial separation of its turb. There may be some separation of function in these nations; the nation that lives offshore probably has more sailors and fishermen than the nation that occupies the nearby hills, but both nations need their own specialists, soldiers, and servants.

<span id="guilds"></span>
== Guilds ==

An alternative to nations is guilds, that is, organizing the grogs by their function. Many covenants simply divide their covenants into servants, specialists, and soldiers, and consider these three &quot;guilds&quot; sufficient — and often they are. However, the larger covenants get, the more need there is to divide the grogs into smaller guilds with more defined functions. A covenant that has more than one source of income often institutes guilds as a means to organize collecting the revenue and conducting the necessary business that keeps the income sources operational.

There is also a tendency for grogs to selforganize. If there are a lot of craftsmen, then they tend to band together to mimic the guild structure of the outer world. If the covenant uses light cavalry as an elite unit, then these individuals may not want to fraternize with common foot soldiers.

Note that the division of grogs into guilds does not necessarily mean literal guilds; that is, a political unit that can arrange simultaneous withdrawal of services in order to coerce better conditions for their masters.

<span id="professional-guilds"></span>
==== Professional Guilds ====

Clearly a good model for covenant organization is the craft guilds, service guilds, and merchant guilds that are becoming more widespread in Mythic Europe in the 13th century. Once confined to big cities, guilds can now be found almost anywhere, at least in the West, and they regulate the quality of the goods produced by their members. A guild consists of all craftsmen that use the same or a group of closely allied Craft or Profession Abilities. However, at a covenant, a guild might exist for each Martial Ability, or perhaps even for select groups of Arcane or Supernatural Abilities. The guild provides incomes for the destitute and disabled, pays for the funeral services of deceased members, holds its own religious ceremonies, and sometimes even provides schooling for their members' children.

At the head of a guild is the dean, elected by the guild members from among their number. The dean is supported by the aldermen (guild officials), who police the guild, ensure the quality of the work, and enforce the guild rules. Below the aldermen are the senior masters and masters. A master has sufficient skill to run his own shop, and has the right to attend meetings at the guildhall and have a say in the running of the guild. Senior masters have been masters for ten or more years, and may run more than one workshop, which can prove very lucrative. Each master might have one or two journeymen and several apprentices, who form the lowest rungs of the guild ladder. More information about guilds can be found in Chapter 3 of City &amp; Guild

The difference between a professional guild and other forms of governance is that the guild exists because its members want it. They have an expectation of advancement through the guild's ranks, and to one day have a say in how it is run. A guild might be a more familiar system for players who are used to concepts of social mobility and providing benefits for the hard workers, although this is an anachronism for much of Mythic Europe outside of the professional guilds.

<span id="monastery"></span>
=== Monastery ===

A monastery is designed along a guild structure. Unlike the clear hierarchy of the noble household, the abbot of a monastery designates officials to manage each aspect of the daily life of the monastery. These officials are then responsible for meeting the monastery's needs in their department, and can requisition manpower and finances as needed. This is a good model for a small covenant, where staff need not be permanently designated as a cook or a chambermaid, but instead take on such roles as requested.

The abbot is the secular and spiritual leader of a monastery. He appoints various senior obedentiaries to care for different departments, so the terrar is in charge of the estate, the cellarer in charge of food, the bursar in charge of money, and so forth. Rather than having a staff or workforce assigned to each, these positions permit their holder to request the assistance of the other monks in the completion of their tasks. For more information on the internal structure of monasteries, see ''The Church'', Chapter 4.

<span id="bivalries-and-tension"></span>
=== Bivalries and Tension ===

Any sort of social structure can lead to rivalries among the covenfolk. One nation may have deep-seated prejudices against another (perhaps arising from racial or cultural incompatibilities), or a guild might consider its tasks more important than those of the other guilds, and seek an improved status for its members.

In addition to tension between groups of covenfolk, there can also be tension between prominent individuals. If the covenfolk are split into families, there may be a longstanding feud between the leaders of two families; or there could be a power struggle within the turb over who deserves to be captain, once the present incumbent has retired. A common rivalry occurs between the steward and the chamberlain over precedence; many stewards believe that they should be the superior of the chamberlain. The turb captain need not be excluded from such rivalries; it is common for the captain to think himself more important than either, and he uses the armed men under his control to enforce this point.

The covenant of Tolosa Paratge, in Toulouse in the Provençal Tribunal, is completely split between two factions, the White and the Black, and this rivalry may bring the ancient covenant down completely (Faith &amp; Flame, page 38).

<span id="no-formal-structure"></span>
== No Formal Structure ==

Some covenants have never instituted any sort of structure at all among their covenfolk. This is usually only possible for very small numbers of covenfolk, without some sort of organization, important tasks are likely to be forgotten or neglected. In fact, if left to their own devices with no formal organization imposed upon them, covenfolk usually seek some sort of structure by themselves, it is natural for humans to seek social order.

If the covenfolk form a strong cohesive group, they can all work together toward the common good without needing a formal social structure. This is not to say that everyone does not know who is in charge, but there are fewer differences between servant, soldier, and specialist since everyone lends a hand in each task.

<span id="the-qovenant-in-play"></span>
= The Qovenant in Play =

ovenants do not gain Build Points while they are being played. Instead, the characters create enchanted devices, write books, and trade for further resources.

Events in play may lead to the covenant gaining or losing Boons or Hooks.

If a Boon is lost, the characters should be given story opportunities to regain it. In effect, the lost Boon becomes a Hook.

If a Boon is gained, the covenant should gain a corresponding Hook, representing the reaction of the rest of the world to the change in its fortunes.

If a Hook is lost, because the situation is resolved, that is fine, and part of the natural growth of the saga.

If a Hook is gained, again, that is fine.

Not all Hooks can be removed, but if a particular Hook can be overcome it should take at least half a dozen stories for a minor Hook, and around twenty for a major Hook. The Hooks are supposed to drive a significant portion of the saga, so they should not be resolved until they have done so.

<span id="vii-hermetic-magic"></span>
== VII. Hermetic Magic ==

n the eighth century the wizard Bonisagus developed a universal theory of magic and the Order of Hermes was born. The most immediate advantage

of Hermetic magic was that it allowed wizards of diverse magical backgrounds to share their knowledge. Before Bonisagus' theory, the practice of magic had been highly individualized and therefore limited in scope. With the ability to share and accumulate knowledge, Hermetic magi gained an immense advantage over other wizards. This universal theory is not without its disadvantages, however. Detractors of the system believe that the strict regimentation of Hermetic magic robs truly brilliant magi of the chance to discover the modes of magic power that best suit them, and that it is truly helpful only to mediocre magi who need an exact system to guide them.

The Order of Hermes is only a part of the greater magical world. There exist non-Hermetic magi from European traditions, and from further afield. Be this as it may, the rules presented here cover Hermetic magic only. Hedge Magic Revised Edition, Rival Magic, The Cradle and the Crescent, Between Sand and Sea, Lands of the Nile, and the Realms of Power sourcebooks provide rules for many non-Hermetic traditions. Storyguides should also feel free to create non-Hermetic magic that governs monsters, wizards, and magic items that do not fit the paradigm set out in these rules, and thus keep magic a mystery even to those who think they know it all.

Hermetic magic is a highly useful but not entirely perfect theory. These rules reflect the things that magi expect to happen when they work with magic. While the expected usually occurs, the exact effects of magic can be influenced by countless factors, including such vagaries as the phase of the moon, the spiritual nature of the target, and the mental state of the caster. This allows storyguides to occasionally bend the rules and interpret magical effects imaginatively.

<span id="the-gift-2"></span>
== The Gift ==

he capacity to work magic is known as The Gift among Hermetic magi. Only people with The Gift can be taught Hermetic magic, but not all of

them learn it. Many Hermetic magi say that people with minor mystical abilities have a partial Gift, but it is not clear that the source of their power is the same as that of magi. People with The Gift may be taught non-Hermetic magic instead, but it is almost impossible for one person to learn two kinds of magic. (See page 383 for the rules for this.)

The Gift is very rare, appearing in perhaps one person in a few thousand. Magi have many theories as to the cause of The Gift, but none of these are generally accepted.

The Gift has a strong emotional effect on those around the Gifted person, making them suspicious and mistrustful of the Gifted individual, inspiring

envy. As a result, social interactions are very difficult for the Gifted. Some Hermetic magi have the Gentle Gift (a Virtue, see page 82), which does not affect people in this way, while others have the Blatant Gift (a Flaw, see page 120), which has much more intense effects. The Gift also bothers mundane animals, which avoid the Gifted individual as far as possible. The Gift only affects those in the presence of the Gifted individual. Letters from a Gifted individual do not have this effect, nor does a messenger from such an individual, unless the messenger himself has The Gift.

When roleplaying a character dealing with a maga, have him act as though she has a wellestablished reputation for dishonesty and unreliability, and for undeserved privilege of whatever sort is most important to him. Thus, a merchant acts as if he believes that a maga is wealthy through cheating people, while a lord acts as if he believes that the maga is a treacherous vassal who retains her position through bribery or similar. If the maga tries to overcome this reaction through negotiation, she suffers a -3 penalty to any die rolls she must make. Someone without The Gift negotiating on her behalf does not suffer the penalty, but must deal with the mistrust inspired by The Gift. If the maga manages to convince or coerce someone into interacting with her, she suffers the -3 penalty to all rolls and totals based on social interaction, including training, whether the maga is the trainer or the trainee.

character as having a well-established reputation for dishonesty and treachery of a dangerous kind, as well as for the possession of ill-gotten gains. People interacting with a Blatantly Gifted maga are extremely wary and rather hostile. Animals treat her as a threat to be driven away from their territory. If the maga tries to overcome this reaction through negotiation, she suffers a –6 penalty to any die rolls she must make. An unGifted individual negotiating on her behalf suffers no penalty, but must overcome the hostility. If a maga with Blatant Gift interacts with someone, she suffers the -6 penalty to all social rolls and totals, as for the normal Gift.

Note that those interacting with Gifted people do not actually think that they have a bad reputation; that is merely an analogy to help you to work out how they would react.

The Gift only has its effects if the maga comes to the attention of someone, just like a reputation. If a Gifted maga dresses unostentatiously, keeps to the middle of the group, does not appear to be the leader, and doesn't talk to anyone, then the group should be able to travel without suffering from people's reactions to The Gift, as long as the maga behaves herself. The Blatant Gift makes this a lot harder; these precautions reduce people's reactions to those inspired by the normal Gift.

People do not get used to The Gift, even if they have lived with magi all their lives. They can, however, get used to

overrides the effects of reputation. The mundane members of a covenant can be assumed to be used to the resident magi, and to react to them as appropriate to their actual behavior (see page 186, in the Covenant chapter, for rules for this).

Nevertheless, they will be suspicious of visiting magi.

People who have dealt with a lot of different Gifted individuals do become able to recognize the effect of The Gift for what it is. They still feel the suspicion and envy, but they can act politely anyway. Mundane Redcaps have sufficient experience to recognize The Gift, and a mundane given the job of greeting all visitors to a covenant is likely to get it over the course of a decade or so. Most covenfolk, however, merely become accustomed to 'their' magi.

The Parma Magica blocks these effects of The Gift entirely. A maga with a Parma Magica is not bothered by the Gifts of other magi, although other people are still bothered by her Gift. This effect may have been as valuable as Magic Resistance in aiding the foundation of the Order.

Animals also react badly to people with The Gift. In their case, the reaction tends to be a combination of fear and hostility, with much more hostility if the magus has the Blatant Gift. Gifted characters cannot ride horses without magical aid, as the horse tries to throw them off as quickly as possible. Similarly, they can never train dogs to recognize them as friends.

Creatures belonging to one of the four supernatural realms may have different reactions to the Gifted. Some behave like mundane animals, others like mundane humans, while some appear completely unaffected by The Gift. Demons, in particular, do not seem to be bothered by The Gift, but that may just be because they envy every human being anyway.

<span id="first-impressions"></span>
== First Impressions ==

A group of characters who appear to be ordinary travelers (rather than an armed band) seek shelter in:

<span id="a-typical-village"></span>
== A Typical Village ==

Gentle (or no) Gift: The villagers are cautious, but may offer the characters shelter in their homes if treated well. If someone has a separate barn, the characters are probably allowed to sleep there.

Gift: The villagers refuse to let the characters into their homes or property, and bar the doors and keep a watch all night if they camp on common ground.

Blatant Gift: The villagers tell the characters to get out of the village, and attempt to drive them off if they do not leave voluntarily. They keep some sort of watch for the next few days to make sure that the characters do not return.

<span id="an-inn"></span>
==== An Inn ====

Gentle (or no) Gift: Visitors are welcomed if there is space, and the innkeeper can be bargained down from his initial price. Other guests eagerly share news with the characters, exchanging tales of where they have come from for the characters' stories.

Gift: The innkeeper treats the characters coldly. He sets his prices very high, and will not be bargained down. Other guests ignore the characters as much as possible, and keep a careful eye on them.

Blatant Gift: The innkeeper refuses admittance, and threatens to call the watch if the characters do not move along.

<span id="a-monastery"></span>
== A Monastery ==

Gentle (or no) Gift: The characters are welcomed, housed in the guest quarters, and fed at the common table with any other travelers. They are encouraged to attend services, and other travelers talk as if at an inn. The characters may stay for two or three nights before the monks start to drop hints that they should move on.

Gift: The characters are welcomed, and housed somewhere isolated in the monastic complex. They are fed at the common table, but one or two monks are always around, keeping an eye on them. The other travelers do not talk to them. The monks start to drop hints that they should move on after one night.

Blatant Gift: The characters are housed in a building outside the monastery walls, and their food is brought to them there. They are watched by at least one monk and enough lay brothers to deal with mundane trouble at all times. If they ask to attend the service, they are escorted to and from the church and watched at all times. They are strongly encouraged to leave, and are no longer fed, after the first night.

<span id="a-covenant"></span>
== A Covenant ==

These descriptions assume that the visitors announce themselves as Hermetic magi, and are not known to be hostile. They also assume that the guard room is outside the Aegis of the Hearth.

Gentle Gift: The characters are asked into the guard room while the magi are informed of their arrival. The guards chat while they are waiting.

Gift: The characters are asked inside while the magi are informed, but the guards do not talk much, and keep a careful eye on all of them.

Blatant Gift: The characters are made to wait outside while someone brings the magi. The gates are made secure, and all the guards are on high alert.

<span id="established-relationships"></span>
== Established Relationships ==

A group including at least one magus arrives somewhere where the magus has visited many times before.

<span id="an-inn-1"></span>
==== An Inn ====

The characters return to an inn where they have always been polite, tipped generously, and never caused trouble.

Gentle Gift: The innkeeper welcomes them enthusiastically, shows them to the best table in the house, and clears a good room for them to stay in if they want. If there are regulars at the inn, they are happy to see the characters again.

Gift: The innkeeper welcomes them enthusiastically, and shows them to a nice table slightly isolated from the rest of the room, to avoid upsetting the other customers. He clears a good room for them to stay in, and sees to most of the service personally if he has new staff. He tries to make small-talk with the magus, but clearly prefers talking to the companions.

Blatant Gift: The innkeeper hurries to meet them at the door, welcomes them politely, and quickly ushers them to a private room so that they don't disturb the other guests. He serves them personally, but while he is polite to the magus, he clearly tries to have as little to do with him as possible. (This assumes that the Blatant Gifted magus kept a very low profile on earlier visits, so that they were allowed in.)

<span id="a-monastery-1"></span>
== A Monastery ==

The characters return to a monastery where they have always been polite, at least apparently pious, never caused trouble, and have donated generously (but not so spectacularly as to be viewed as potential patrons). The descriptions assume that there are no women in the party, and that the monastery can cope with bending the normal rules slightly.

Gentle Gift: The characters are quickly recognized, greeted warmly, and may even be invited to dine with the abbot occasionally. If their normal visits are brief, they are allowed to stay for some time before anything is said, and even then the monks are concerned as to their reasons for the long stay rather than keen to move them on

Gift: The characters are housed away from the main guest quarters, and they take their meals with the monks, who know them, rather than the other travelers, who don't. At least some of the monks are just as eager to talk to the magus as to the other members of the group.

Blatant Gift: The characters are kept waiting at the gate while a senior monk is sent for. They are housed away from the main guest quarters, and fed there, although one or two of the monks probably join them, both out of courtesy and to hear the news. The monks clear a side chapel so that the characters can attend Mass there, rather than being in the main body of the church. The characters are not watched, although the magus with the Blatant Gift is expected to keep to himself as much as possible (and, to get to this point, he must have done so in the past).

<span id="the-hermetic-arts"></span>
== The Hermetic Arts ==

he term &quot;Arts&quot; refers collectively to Techniques and Forms — two classes of magical disciplines that work together in spellcasting. Techniques govern the essential

manipulations that magic can perform; Forms, the essential natural phenomena that magic can manipulate. Techniques and Forms have Latin names. A Technique is referred to by a verb conjugated in first person, and a Form by a noun. You combine one Technique and one Form to cast a spell, and together their names indicate the spell's general function. For example, a &quot;Creo Ignem&quot; spell employs the Technique of &quot;Creo&quot; (&quot;I create&quot;) and the Form of &quot;Ignem&quot; (&quot;fire&quot;) and produces light, heat, or fire. A &quot;Muto Ignem&quot; spell (&quot;Muto&quot; = &quot;I transform&quot;) transforms light, heat, or fire in some way, such as by increasing its intensity, its size, or its shape.

Hermetic magi have a score in each Art. Your scores in the Arts represent your aptitude for working with the various types of magic. Arts are not merely knowledges; your Arts are ultimately ways your very being expresses magical energy. In reflection of this, your score in a Form (in addition to allowing you to cast spells incorporating that Form) helps you resist spells of that type and avoid harm from mundane sources related to that Form. For instance, your Ignem (fire) score gives you a bonus to resist damage from fire and cold. This bonus is equal to one fifth of your score in the Form, rounded up, and adds to your ability to resist any damage deriving from that Form. The most important examples of each Form bonus's applicability are listed under the Form, but these are not exhaustive lists.

Form Bonus: Form score/5 (rounded up)

These bonuses do not stack. If it seems like two would apply to a given hazard, use only the higher bonus.

In the following two sections, each of the Arts

In the following two sections, each of the Arts is listed with its common two-letter abbreviation, its translation from Latin, a general description, and its Hermetic pronunciation. More detailed descriptions of what a magus can do with various Technique Form combinations are given in the Spells chapter on page 313.

<span id="techniques"></span>
== Techniques ==

<span id="creo-cr-i-create"></span>
== Creo (Cr) &quot;I create&quot; ==

Creo magic makes things that exist independently into better things of their kind, which includes bringing them into existence from nothing. Things that exist independently are called substances, and include people, trees, and rocks, but do not include colors, weights, and sizes. Creo can thus both create and heal things.

The kind of thing that something is depends on its form. Natural things, such as plants, animals, flames, and so on, have simple forms, which means that the form is just one thing. This makes them easy to create and heal. Natural things created by magic are always perfect examples of their kind unless the magus wants them to be damaged. Similarly, magic can heal a natural thing even if the caster has no idea what is wrong, as it simply restores the form.

Artificial things, such as bread, swords and books, have complex forms. Their forms are combinations of several natural forms put together in a particular way. Creating an artificial thing by magic requires some skill on the part of the magus, reflected by his Finesse Ability. An Int + Finesse roll is made to determine how good the created thing is. Further, a magus can only create something he knows about. Any magus can create bread or cloth, but in order to create an elaborate mosaic depicting the foundation of the Order of Hermes the caster would need to know what it should depict. If he was wrong, the mosaic would also be wrong. Similar considerations apply to repairing artificial things.

A magus need not be able to create an artificial item by mundane means in order to create it by magic; he only needs to be somewhat familiar with it. A magically created item will always be the right sort of thing unless the magus botches his Finesse roll. Thus, unless the magus botches, magically created cloth will always be a whole piece and keep people warm, but it might not be very attractive if he rolled badly. For further details, see Craft Magic on page 306.

A magus can also use Creo to make something a better example of its kind, even if it isn't actually

injured or damaged. Thus, Creo can make a horse as swift as the fastest horse, or a man as strong as the strongest man. Creo cannot make a horse able to run as fast as the wind, because no ordinary horse can do that, nor can it make a man strong enough to lift a castle. Since maturation involves becoming a better example of your kind, Creo magic can make something mature quickly. Aging after maturation involves becoming a worse example of your kind, and thus is covered by Perdo.

Creo magic can also create unnatural things, such as a winged cat, but a Muto requisite is necessary.

Magically created things last for the duration of the spell, but their effects last indefinitely. Thus, the footprints of a magically created horse do not vanish, nor does its dung, if it was fed on mundane food. If a magically created horse was fed on mundane food for a year, it would leave a mundane corpse when the spell expired, as the mundane food has been converted into mundane body. Conversely, magically created food only nourishes for as long as the duration lasts, and someone who has eaten it becomes extremely hungry when the duration expires. Things washed with magically created water stay clean, but people made drunk with magically created alcohol instantly sober up.

Pronounced 'CRAY-oh.'

<span id="intellego-in-i-perceive"></span>
== Intellego (In) &quot;I perceive&quot; ==

Intellego is the Art of perception. It allows a maga to gather information directly from the forms of things. This information does not deal with the appearances of things, unless Intellego Imaginem magic is used. Rather, it provides information about the actual nature of a thing. Thus, Intellego magic is not deceived by mundane disguises.

Pronounced 'in-TEL-le-go.'

<span id="muto-mu-i-transform"></span>
== Muto (Mu) &quot;I transform&quot; ==

By using Muto magic a magus can grant or remove properties something cannot naturally have. Thus, Muto can give a person wings or turn her skin green, or turn a person into a wolf. The difficulty of the magic depends on the extent of the change, so that turning someone's skin green is easy, but turning someone into a golden statue is difficult.

It is possible to use Muto to give something an ability that it does not normally have. However, this can only change the target; it cannot give unnatural properties to other things. For example, a Muto Animal spell could give a feather the ability to cut stone. Feathers cannot naturally cut stone, but stone can naturally be cut. A Muto Animal spell could not give a feather the ability to

turn stones into gold, because stones cannot naturally turn into gold. A Muto Terram spell could, of course, turn a stone into gold.

Muto magic cannot affect the properties that something has naturally, although it can add other properties to them to mask their effects. Thus Muto magic can neither injure nor kill someone directly, although it could render her immobile, by turning her to stone, or kill her indirectly, by turning her into a fish on dry land so that she suffocates.

Pronounced 'MOO-toe.'

<span id="perdo-pe-i-destroy"></span>
== Perdo (Pe) &quot;I destroy&quot; ==

Perdo makes things worse examples of the kind of thing they are. It is the opposite of Creo. Perdo magic can simply destroy things, removing them completely from existence, or it can destroy aspects of a thing. Thus, Perdo Corpus could remove a person's weight, while leaving the rest of his properties intact, and Perdo Ignem could make a fire unable to burn anything. Perdo alone can only destroy the whole of a natural property; making fire able to burn only wood would be Perdo with a Muto requisite (see page 311 for requisites), Perdo destroying the ability to burn anything, and Muto granting the ability to burn only wood, a property that fire cannot naturally have.

Perdo magic is easier if the thing can naturally lose the property destroyed. Thus, it is easier to kill a person than to remove his weight while leaving his other properties intact, because the first can occur naturally while the second cannot. Further, destroying properties that a thing cannot naturally lose falls under the Limit of Essential Nature (see page 210), and thus cannot be permanent; the destroyed properties return by themselves at the end of the spell's duration.

Perdo can only make something a worse example of what it is. You cannot sharpen a sword with Perdo, even though sharpening involves removing some of the metal. Similarly, you cannot remove someone's property of being wounded, because that makes them a better example of what they are.

Pronounced 'PARE-doe.'

<span id="rego-re-i-control"></span>
== Rego (Re) &quot;I control&quot; ==

The Art of Rego allows a maga to change the state of a thing to some other state that the individual thing can naturally have. Thus, since all things can naturally have any location, Rego magic allows a maga to move things around. Rego can also make a tree blossom out of season, put a person to sleep, shape a piece of stone into a statue, or weave thread into a tunic. It cannot make an animal appear young

again, because mature animals cannot naturally become young (although Muto could do this). Rego also cannot make an animal old, because aging is decay away from the form (so Perdo could do this). Similarly, although Rego can make a tree bear fruit out of season, that fruit would not contain seeds, as the seeds are separate substances (potential trees), and thus creating them would require Creo. Equally, Rego cannot turn a brown dog black, because while dogs can naturally be black, the brown dog in question cannot naturally take on that color.

Mundane craftsmen can only change something's state to another state that the thing can naturally have. Thus, most changes that a mundane craftsman can make can also be made by Rego magic. In this case, a Finesse roll is required to determine the quality of the outcome. Rego can make changes that a mundane craftsman cannot make, however, when the craftsman is limited simply by available tools, time, or skill. On the other hand, mundane craftsmen can use their tools to simply damage or destroy things, and Rego magic cannot do that: it falls under Perdo. Rego magic could be used to control an axe to cut a tree down, but it could not be used to cut the tree down directly — that would be Perdo. Once the tree was cut down, however, Rego magic could shape the wood into planks. For more details, see Craft Magic on page 306.

Pronounced 'RAY-go.'

<span id="forms"></span>
== Forms ==

<span id="animal-an-animal"></span>
== Animal (An) &quot;animal&quot; ==

Animal concerns animals of all kinds, from the fish of the sea to the birds of the air. Animal spells cannot affect people, and Hermetic theorists still debate the reason for this.

Form Bonus: Soak against animal attacks (claws, bites, etc.), rolls to resist animal poisons. Pronounced 'ah-nee-MAHL.'

<span id="aquam-aq-water"></span>
== Aquam (Aq) &quot;water&quot; ==

Aquam concerns water and all manner of liquids, as well as properties of liquidity.

Form Bonus: Rolls to resist drowning and thirst, soak against water jets and the like.

Pronounced 'AH-kwahm.'

<span id="auram-au-air"></span>
=== Auram (Au) &quot;air&quot; ===

Auram is the Art of air, wind, and weather. It also governs gaseous forms in general.

Form bonus: Rolls to resist suffocation, including drowning, soak against weather phenomena such as lightning.

Pronounced 'OW-rahm.'

<span id="corpus-co-body"></span>
== Corpus (Co) &quot;body&quot; ==

Corpus is the Art of human bodies. This Art affects dead bodies and the bodies of magical or faerie creatures that look human, as well as those of living humans. Since natural philosophy asserts that these things have no more in common than their appearance, and Corpus does not affect human statues, Hermetic theorists are puzzled by the range of this Form.

Form bonus: Soak against human unarmed attacks, rolls to resist disease. It does not apply to aging rolls.

Pronounced 'COR-poos.'

<span id="herbam-he-plant"></span>
== herbam (he) &quot;plant&quot; ==

This Form concerns plants and trees. This includes plant matter of all types, including that which is no longer alive — like dead wood and linens.

Form bonus: Soak against wooden weapons, rolls to resist herbal poisons, rolls to resist starvation.

Pronounced 'HARE-bahm.'

<span id="ignem-ig-fire"></span>
== Ignem (Ig) &quot;fire&quot; ==

This Form concerns fire, heat, and light.

Form bonus: Soak against fire and cold. Pronounced 'IG-nem.'

<span id="imaginem-im-image"></span>
== Imaginem (Im) &quot;image&quot; ==

This Form concerns the things in the world that the senses respond to.

Natural philosophy calls them species (SPEH-kee-ayss, to be distinguished from species of animals and such). All things constantly give off species for each of the senses. Those for touch and taste do not travel far, while those for sight require light to get any distance from the originating body. Imaginem spells normally affect the process by which species are produced, rather than the species themselves. Thus, the species emanating from an illusion are not themselves magical.

Imaginem magic can also affect the species themselves, and if it does, those species are magical, and must Penetrate in order to pass through Magic Resistance and be perceived. This uses the same guidelines as spells affecting the process by which species are produced, and is discussed in more detail in the Jerbiton chapter of Houses of Hermes: Societates.

Note that Imaginem cannot create actual solidity, although it could make something 'feel solid' until you accidentally put your hand right through the surface. Touch illusions are much more effective at changing the way that an already solid surface feels, making a wooden table feel like stone, or a knife feel blunt.

Imaginem only changes the appearance that an object presents to the world. It does not change the actual effects of the object. Imaginem could make a fire feel cool, but the fire would still burn.

Form bonus: Rolls to resist confusion, deafening, or nausea caused by sights, sounds, smells, or tastes.

Pronounced 'ih-MAH-gih-nem.'

<span id="mentem-me-mind"></span>
== Mentem (Me) &quot;mind&quot; ==

This Form concerns minds, thoughts, and spirits. Mentem can also affect the &quot;bodies&quot; of noncorporeal beings, such as ghosts, as these are maintained in the physical world directly by a spirit's will.

Form bonus: Rolls to resist mundane persuasion, deception, or temptation.

Pronounced 'MEN-tem.'

<span id="terram-te-earth"></span>
== Terram (Te) &quot;earth&quot; ==

This Form concerns solids, especially earth and stone.

Form bonus: Soak against metal or stone weapons, rolls to resist mineral poisons.

Pronounced 'TARE-rahm.'

<span id="vim-vi-power"></span>
== Vim (Vi) &quot;power&quot; ==

This Form concerns raw magical power. All the Arts rely on the raw energy and potential of magic, but this Art refines the use of magic itself, allowing magi to assume even greater control of their spells. Vim also affects magical, infernal, divine, and faerie creatures.

Form bonus: Rolls to resist Twilight (see page 228), but not rolls to comprehend it; soak total against damage inflicted by your own spell-casting, but not damage inflicted by your own spells.

Pronounced 'WEEM.'

<span id="the-glemental-forms"></span>
=== The Glemental Forms ===

Aquam, Auram, Ignem, and Terram are the elemental forms, dealing with the non-living things in the world. Often, a thing falls under more than one of these Arts. Thus, molten lava is basically Terram, because it is a form of rock, but its liquidity is governed by Aquam and its heat by Ignem. Similarly, ice is basically Aquam, being a form of water, but its solidity is covered by Terram and its coldness by Ignem. As a rule, simple creation or destruction of a non-living thing needs only the basic Art, without requisites (see page 311). Thus, to create ice you need only Creo Aquam. However, affecting the aspects and properties of a thing might use the other Arts. Thus, making ice warm would require Creo Ignem. A Creo Aquam spell with an Ignem requisite could create warm ice — still solid, but warm. Alternatively, a magus could simply create warmth, and allow it to naturally melt the ice.

Mist is a kind of air, so its basic form is Auram, but its dampness means that it is also affected by Aquam in certain respects. Weather phenomena are all basically Auram, including rain storms, but a spell to affect the rain alone would be Aquam. Hail storms, then, are basically Auram, but the hail stones are basically Aquam with elements of Ignem and Terram.

<span id="limits-of-magic"></span>
== Limits of Magic ==

agic, though a very powerful force, is not omnipotent. There are certain laws it must conform to and

certain limits that it can never exceed. The limits to Hermetic magic are described below. Most Hermetic theorists believe that there are only two fundamental limits, the Limit of the Divine and the Limit of Essential Nature, and that the other limits are derived from one or other of these. Some theorists think that the lesser limits are merely flaws in Bonisagus's theory.

The boundaries of Hermetic magic are well known to the Order, but that doesn't stop magi from challenging them. Indeed, many magi spend countless years searching in vain for a way to transcend these limits. Certainly, any magus who actually succeeds in doing so will become famous, perhaps as famous as the Order's very Founders.

<span id="the-limit-of-the-divine"></span>
== The Limit of the Divine ==

Hermetic magic cannot affect the Divine. Any magic attempting to do so simply fails. Everyone agrees that Hermetic powerlessness in the face of miracles is a result of this limit, as is the inability of Hermetic magic to affect the transubstantiated bread and wine of the Mass.

The agents of the Divine, such as saints and angels, are protected from magic to some extent, but are not normally completely immune. As a general rule, it seems that any being with a will separate from God's can be affected by magic, at least in principle. Only direct action by God is completely immune.

<span id="the-limit-of-essential-nature"></span>
== The Limit of Essential Nature ==

Any magic which violates a thing's essential nature must be maintained, and when power is no longer supplied the thing returns to its natural state. Thus, Muto magic must always be maintained, while the effects of Rego magic persist after the spell expires. A thing's essential nature cannot itself be changed. While Hermetic magic can completely change the way a thing appears, it cannot affect what that thing is.

A thing's essential nature varies depending on what it is. All human beings are essentially human,

mortal creatures with reason, senses, and the ability to move and reproduce. The basic shape of the human body is also part of the essential nature, although bits can be cut off. The game works on the assumption that every feature of someone's physical appearance is either an injury (which can be fixed with Creo magic), or part of their essential nature. This is necessary to avoid the ability to permanently change appearance with a single Momentary Duration Rego spell. A single characteristic may be an injury for one person, and part of the essential nature of another. For example, some people are essentially blind, whereas others are blind merely as a result of chance. As a rule, any disability purchased as a Flaw at character creation is part of the character's essential nature, while disabilities acquired later are not.

<span id="the-lesser-limits"></span>
== The Lesser Limits ==

The Lesser Limits are as follows.

<span id="the-limit-of-aging"></span>
== The Limit of Aging ==

Hermetic magic cannot halt or reverse natural aging, although it can slow it down and mitigate its effects. This means that Hermetic magic cannot remove Decrepitude. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of Essential Nature.

<span id="the-limit-of-arcane-connections"></span>
=== The Limit of Arcane Connections ===

Hermetic magic cannot affect an unsensed target without an Arcane Connection. This is widely believed to be a flaw in Hermetic theory, as Intellego magic is much less tightly bound by this limit than other kinds. Intellego can determine whether, for example, there are any people behind a wall the magus can see, but Perdo Corpus magic cannot affect those people until the magus is aware of them.

<span id="the-limit-of-creation"></span>
== The Limit of Creation ==

Hermetic magic is incapable of creating anything permanently without raw vis. This limit affects all uses of Creo magic. However, as pure Creo magic does not violate the essential nature of its target, Creo magic that does use raw vis does not need to be maintained. If a Creo effect has a Muto requisite, to create something unnatural, the effect cannot be made permanent by using raw vis. This applies to the whole creation, not just the unnatural aspects. Theorists are divided on whether this derives from the Limit of the Divine or the Limit of Essential Nature. A few think it is a flaw in Bonisagus's theory.

<span id="the-limit-of-energy"></span>
== The Limit of Energy ==

Hermetic magic cannot restore one's physical energy (Fatigue levels), nor can it restore Confidence (see page 29). Most magi think that this is a flaw in Hermetic theory.

<span id="the-limit-of-experience"></span>
== The Limit of Experience ==

Hermetic magic cannot create skills or knowledge in a person by manipulating their mind, nor can it transfer such things (Abilities, in game terms) from one person to another. This is widely believed to be a flaw in Hermetic theory, although a few magi have suggested that it is a flaw in their understanding of Abilities. Hermetic magic can create much simpler things of the same general type as Abilities, which would support the latter interpretation. (This is discussed in more detail in ''Houses of Hermes: Societates'', pages 68–69.)

<span id="the-limit-of-the-infernal"></span>
=== The Limit of the Infernal ===

Intellego magic is almost completely useless against the Infernal, because it reveals only what the demons want you believe, whether that is true or not.

The source of this limit is fiercely debated. Optimists think it is a limit in Hermetic theory. Pessimists think it is derived from the Limit of the Divine. Moderates think it is derived from the Limit of Essential Nature, in that deception is the nature of demons, so that if you use Intellego on them you only detect their deceptions. Heretical magi point out that, thanks to this limit, there is no way to tell the difference between God and a very powerful demon.

<span id="the-limit-of-the-lunar-sphere"></span>
== The Limit of the Lunar Sphere ==

Hermetic magic cannot affect the lunar sphere, nor anything above it. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of the Divine. The lunar sphere is the innermost of the celestial spheres, which carry the stars and planets on their revolutions around the earth, and so this limit rarely bothers magi directly.

<span id="the-limit-of-the-soul"></span>
== The Limit of the Soul ==

Hermetic magic cannot create an immortal soul, and so may not create true human life nor restore the dead to life. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of the Divine, although a significant number think that Hermetic magic's inability to raise the dead reflects nothing more than a flaw in the theory.

Animals have no immortal souls, and so may be created. Magical creatures and faeries are generally believed not to have immortal souls, and there are spells that appear to create them, but some magi believe that such spells really summon existing beings. Angels and demons are nothing but immortal souls.

<span id="the-limit-of-time"></span>
==== The Limit of Time ====

Hermetic magic is incapable of altering the passage of time. It cannot affect anything in the past, and can only affect the future by making changes in the present. This limit also means that Hermetic magic cannot scry on the past or future. Most magi think this derives from the Limit of the Divine.

<span id="the-limit-of-true-feeling"></span>
== The Limit of True Feeling ==

A few humans have a love, friendship, or faith that Hermetic magic cannot affect in any way. (In game terms, this is indicated by a Virtue or Flaw.) Magi agree that this must derive from one of the two fundamental Limits, because most emotions can be affected by magic, but they disagree as to which one.

<span id="the-limit-of-vis"></span>
=== The Limit of Vis ===

Hermetic magic cannot change the Art to which raw vis is attuned. Most magi think that this is a result of the Limit of Essential Nature.

<span id="the-limit-of-carping"></span>
== The Limit of Carping ==

Prolonged exposure to active magic or high auras usually causes changes, generally referred to as warping. Hermetic magic is completely unable to affect these changes once they have happened.

<span id="the-limit-of-magic-resistance"></span>
== The Limit of Magic Resistance ==

Non-Hermetic magic is incapable of granting general Magic Resistance, as far as Hermetic magi know. (The same is true of Faerie powers, but not the Divine or Infernal.) This is obviously not a fundamental limit of magic, as Hermetic magic does grant Magic Resistance, through the Parma Magica and Form scores, and many magi take this as evidence that Hermetic magic is simply superior to all other traditions.

More knowledgeable magi are aware that some non-Hermetic traditions break some of the Lesser Limits of Hermetic magic. The optimistic among them take this as evidence that Hermetic magic could also break those limits. See Ancient Magic, Rival Magic, and Hedge Magic Revised Edition for examples of such traditions.

Wizard's Twilight (see page 228) is one manifestation of warping.

Most magi would like to believe that this derives from the Limit of the Divine, as that would make magic a manifestation of Divine power. Others believe that it is derived from the Limit of Essential Nature.

<span id="baw-vis"></span>
== Baw Vis ==

aw magic power, known as vis (pronounced 'WEES'), is sometimes found stored in and partially constituting some physical substance. This can

occur either because a magus has trapped it there or because it was deposited there by natural magical processes. Vis trapped in some substance is called raw vis, and magi have many uses for it.

Raw vis is always associated with a particular Technique or Form. Thus, there is Ignem vis, Creo vis, Imaginem vis— even Vim vis. Raw vis invariably exists in some kind of matter appropriate to the Technique or Form to which it corresponds. Animal vis might be found in blood, skins, or horns; Herbam vis in plant fiber or sap; Terram vis in crystals; and so on. When raw vis is used its power is permanently lost. When this happens its substance often changes — dissolving, withering, crumbling, shriveling, or otherwise degrading — in whatever way is appropriate to it. This normally does not happen if the vis has been magically transferred to another receptacle (see page 250), and never happens to such artificial receptacles.

Raw vis can be used in many applications. Examples include strengthening a spell, performing a ritual, creating a magical enchantment, or aiding in the study of the magical Art to which it corresponds. Because of its utility, vis is greatly prized by magi. They often use it as a form of currency, measuring it in units called pawns. Ten pawns are said to make a rook, while ten rooks make a queen. A queen of vis is a legendary quantity, and it would be highly unlikely for a given magus to possess even a sizable fraction of such an amount.

Magi often wear sources of vis in necklaces or rings so that other wizards or magical beings can readily perceive that they have vis to use in response to a threat.

<span id="casting-spells"></span>
== Casting Spells ==

Spellcasting is based on the maga's Casting Score:

CASTING SCORE:

Technique + Form + Stamina - Encumbrance + Aura Modifier

When casting a spell, success is determined from the maga's Casting Total. This is calculated in different ways, depending on the type of spell.

If the generation of the casting total involves rolling a stress die, a botch is normally possible. If the casting roll botches, the casting total is treated as zero, in addition to any other effects.

<span id="spell-basics"></span>
== Spell Basics ==

All Hermetic spells have a Technique, Form, and Level. The Technique and Form are determined by the kind of effect that the spell has, while the Level is determined by how powerful that effect is. Spells also have a magnitude, which is equal to the level divided by five, rounded up. These terms are discussed in more detail in the remainder of this chapter and in the introduction to the Spells chapter, page 301.

<span id="formulaic-magic"></span>
== Formulaic Magic ==

Formulaic magic is the use of spells that the maga already knows. The casting total is the casting score plus a die roll.

FORMULAIC CASTING TOTAL: Casting Score + Die Roll

The type of die rolled depends on the situation. If the maga is not under any pressure, it is a simple die. If she is in a stressful situation, it is a stress die. If the maga has mastered the spell, the die is always a stress die, but in a calm situation there are no botch dice, even if the maga is in a non-Magic aura (see below, page 225).

If the casting total equals or exceeds the level of the spell, the spell is cast and the maga suffers no illeffects. If the casting total falls short of the spell level by ten or less, the spell takes effect and the maga loses a Fatigue level. If the casting total falls short of the spell level by more than ten the spell fails to take effect, but the maga still loses a Fatigue level.

It takes only a few seconds to cast a Formulaic spell.

<span id="ritual-magic"></span>
== Ritual Magic ==

Ritual spells are like Formulaic spells, but they take longer to cast, and involve both elaborate rituals and the expenditure of raw vis. It takes fifteen minutes per magnitude to cast a Ritual spell, and the maga must expend one pawn of vis per magnitude of the spell.

RITUAL CASTING TOTAL:

Casting Score + Artes Liberales

* Philosophiae + Stress Die

The more elaborate process of casting a Ritual spell allows the maga to incorporate astrological calculations and to draw on the powers of natural magic. This is reflected in the addition of the maga's Artes Liberales and Philosophiae scores to the casting total. However, a maga with no experience points in either Ability may still cast Ritual Magic.

The vis used in a Ritual spell must match either the Technique or the Form of the spell. It is possible to use both types of vis at once. In addition, the maximum number of pawns of a given type that a magus may use in spellcasting is his score in the corresponding Art.

The magnitude of Ritual spells, and the need to incorporate many elements, means that a stress die is always rolled, which normally creates the possibility of a botch. However, if the maga has mastered the spell, there are no botch dice in a calm situation, as for Formulaic spells.

See the table to determine whether the spell succeeds or not, and how many Fatigue levels are lost. Fatigue levels lost to Ritual Magic are longterm Fatigue levels, which can only be regained by a good night's sleep (see page 404). If the maga does not have enough Fatigue levels remaining, she takes wounds as well. If she would have taken one more Fatigue level, the wound is minor, if two more, medium, if three more, heavy, and if four more, incapacitating. For example, consider a maga with two remaining Fatigue levels who is casting a level 30 Ritual spell. She generates a casting total of 22, 8 less than the spell level. The spell is cast, but the maga loses her remaining two Fatigue levels, falling unconscious, and then takes a Light wound.

<span id="spontaneous-magic"></span>
== Spontaneous Magic ==

Spontaneous magic involves the production of effects which do not correspond to a spell the magus knows. Magi may choose whether or not to exert themselves when casting Spontaneous magic, but this affects the casting total. If a maga exerts herself, she loses a Fatigue level immediately after the spell is cast, so that if this loss renders her unconscious the spell takes effect first. Casting fatiguing Spontaneous magic is inherently stressful, and so it always uses a stress die, with the risk of a botch, no matter how calm the environment and the maga may otherwise be.

Fatiguing Spontaneous Magic Casting Total: (Casting Score + Stress Die)/2

Non-Fatiguing Spontaneous Magic Casting Total: Casting Score/5

Before casting the spell, the maga must decide on the effect she is trying to create. If her final total is too low for that effect, the spell fails. The chosen effect may be open ended. For example, the maga may want to create the brightest light she can. In this case, the spell will fail if the final level cannot produce any light, but otherwise greater totals will produce brighter light.

If the maga rolls well, she may choose to increase any or all of the Range, Duration, or Target of the spell, but may not change the basic effect. If the effect was open ended, the maga may choose how much of the casting total to devote to the power of the effect, and how much to devote to Range, Duration, and Target. She may also choose to cast the spell at a lower level than her casting total, to increase its Penetration.

Modifiers from circumstances that affect the casting score are divided just like the basic casting score. Modifiers that affect the casting total are not divided.

<span id="penetration-total"></span>
== Penetration Total ==

The maga's casting total measures the total amount of power that she can channel to the spell. The spell's level determines how much power is needed to create the intended effect. Any excess power is used to overcome, or Penetrate, magical defenses. It is possible for the casting total to be lower than the spell level, in which case the maga has no spare energy for penetrating defenses, and even the weakest defense stops the spell.

The Penetration Total measures how effectively the spell can overcome the Magic Resistance of its targets. It is calculated in the same way for all spells.

<span id="penetration-total-casting-total--penetration-bonus---spell-level"></span>
== Penetration Total: Casting Total + Penetration Bonus - Spell Level ==

The Penetration Bonus is at least equal to the magus's score in the Penetration Ability, but may be increased in various ways, see the Penetration section on page 219, below. This may mean that a spell has different Penetration Totals for different targets.

The Penetration Total may be zero or negative. For example, if a magus with a Penetration Bonus of 0, because he has no score in Penetration, casts a Formulaic spell with a Casting Total 5 less than the spell's level, his Penetration Total is -5. If the Penetration is zero or negative, the spell cannot affect any target with Magic Resistance, even if the score of the Magic Resistance is 0. However, it can still affect targets with no Magic Resistance.

If the Penetration Total exceeds a target's Magic Resistance, the spell affects that target. If a spell is targeted at several individuals who have different levels of Magic Resistance, it is possible for the spell to affect some but not others.

The rules for calculating Penetration for the powers of supernatural creatures are given in the Bestiary chapter (page 426). The rules for the Penetration of other supernatural abilities are given on page 412, or in the supplement with the rules for the ability; in most cases, the Penetration is the total generated for the ability plus Penetration Bonus, minus the Ease Factor for the effect.

<span id="concentration"></span>
== Concentration ==

A maga must concentrate in order to cast a spell. If she is distracted, she must make a concentration roll.

<span id="concentration-roll-stamina--concentration--stress-die"></span>
==== Concentration Roll: Stamina + Concentration + Stress Die ====

If the concentration roll fails, the spell fails. If the spell casting roll involved a stress die, you must still roll to see whether the maga botches, and you get one extra botch die. The Ease Factor for the concentration roll depends on the distraction.

{| class="wikitable"

Some spells are also maintained for as long as the maga concentrates. In that case, the Ease Factors on the above table are reduced by three points each.

There are some things it is possible to do while maintaining a spell, but impossible to do while casting. These still distract magi who are concentrating on maintaining a spell, and so concentration rolls are necessary, but the Ease Factors on the following table are already correct, and should not be reduced by three points.

For a continuing situation, such as injury or maintaining another spell, you must make a concentration roll every two minutes (Diameter duration). If you are undistracted, you can maintain concentration for fifteen minutes for every point you have in the Concentration Ability.

Note, if a spell is designed to let the magus do something, doing that thing does not interfere with concentrating on the spell. This applies to spells that let the magus talk to animals, plants, or water, or to spells that let the magus run very quickly.

<span id="spellcasting-options"></span>
= Spellcasting Options =

This section offers options for spellcasting, to use at your discretion.

<span id="all-spells"></span>
== All Spells ==

The following option can be used with all spells.

<span id="using-raw-vis"></span>
== Using Raw Vis ==

It is possible to use raw vis to boost the power of a maga's spells. The vis must match either the Technique or the Form of spell, and a maga may only use a number of pawns of a given type of vis equal to her score in that Art.

LIMIT ON VIS USE IN SPELL CASTING: The Maga's Score in the Art of the Vis

For all spells, a maga may expend vis to increase her casting score. Each pawn of vis expended increases the Casting Score by two.

Vis Boost to Casting Score: +2 Casting Score Per Pawn

Vis must be used when casting Ritual spells, as noted above. Vis used in this way does not increase the Casting Score, but it does count against the limits of what can be used.

It is possible to use vis matching both the Technique and the Form in one casting of a spell, and the amount of each type of vis is limited separately. Thus, a magus with a score of 5 in the

Technique and 3 in the Form could use up to 8 pawns of vis, no more than 5 corresponding to the Technique and no more than 3 corresponding to the Form.

For every pawn of vis used, the maga must roll an extra botch die if the casting roll is stress and comes up a zero. This includes the pawns used to make a Ritual spell possible. Remember that, if the maga can cast a Formulaic spell under calm conditions, she can use a simple die and thus avoid the possibility of botching.

Vis Botch Dice: +1 botch die per pawn of vis used

<span id="non-ritual-spells"></span>
== Non-Ritual Spells ==

The following option can be used when casting Formulaic or most Spontaneous spells, but not for Ritual Magic, or Spontaneous spells cast ceremonially (see later).

<span id="words-and-gestures"></span>
== Words and Gestures ==

Spells are normally cast with a firm voice and bold gestures. However, the caster may choose to be more or less subtle. Increased subtlety gives a penalty to the casting score, while reduced discretion gives a bonus. If the maga changes the volume of her voice, she also changes the range of Voice range spells.

The total modifier is determined by adding the Words and Gestures modifiers together. Thus,

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Words
! Modifier

using exaggerated gestures but making no noise gives a total penalty of –9 to the casting score.

The process of casting a Ritual or ceremonial spell uses all of these options at different points, as determined by the ritual. Thus, unless the caster can speak in a loud voice and make exaggerated gestures, they cannot cast a Ritual spell.

<span id="spontaneous-spells"></span>
== Spontaneous Spells ==

The following options can only be used when a maga is using Spontaneous magic, but can be used equally for fatiguing and non-fatiguing Spontaneous spells.

<span id="fast-casting"></span>
== Fast Casting ==

A maga may choose to cast a Spontaneous spell extremely quickly, as a response to an attack or other surprising event. A fast-cast spell is always cast in the way that a maga casts urgent spells normally. In most cases, that means using a firm voice and bold gestures. However, for example, a maga with the Subtle Magic Virtue who almost never uses gestures to cast spells would also cast fast-cast spells without gestures. It is not possible to apply options that affect the spell itself, rather than the way it is cast, as there is not enough time for the maga to think about anything other than the core features of the spell. For example, a fast-cast spell cannot be boosted with raw vis.

There are two stages: determining the speed of casting, and determining the effect of the spell.

The speed of casting is determined as follows:

Fast Casting Speed: Quickness + Finesse + Stress Die

The Ease Factor for this roll depends on the situation. In combat, the Ease Factor is always the opponent's Initiative Total. Other Ease Factors should be set by the storyguide. Note that, even

in combat, the fast casting speed is not an Initiative Total. A maga may be able to cast more than one fast-cast spell in one combat round. However, each spell after the first takes a cumulative -6 penalty to the Fast Casting Speed: -6 for the second spell, -12 for the third, and so on. Once one of these rolls has been failed, that is the roll does not equal or exceed the Ease Factor for that roll, which may be the Initiative Total of another combatant, the maga can cast no further spells in that combat round.

If the roll for a fast-cast spell fails, the maga may still cast that spell. It will be too late to have its intended effect, and the maga may choose to abort the spell without any risk.

A maga casting a fast-cast spell must subtract ten from the Casting Score before calculating the Casting Total. In addition, if the player rolls a zero, there are two additional botch dice.

Fast Cast Penalty: -10 to Casting Score Fast Cast Botch Dice: +2 botch dice

In order to create a fast-cast defense against magic, a maga must know the Hermetic Form that governs that magic. If the caster is a Hermetic magus and is using words and gestures that she can hear and see, she may determine this automatically. A Perception + Awareness roll may be needed to catch the details of the gestures, particularly if they are subtle.

In other circumstances, the maga must work the Form out. A Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 15 minus the magnitude of the effect is needed.

Determining Form of Magical Effect: Perception + Awareness vs.

15 – effect magnitude

In general, a fast-cast defense with half the level of the attacking spell is enough to protect the maga herself or one other individual. The spell still takes effect, and the side effects of deflecting the spell may have to be dealt with. A fast-cast defense that matches or exceeds the level of the attacking spell can completely neutralize it, probably in a fairly spectacular fashion.

Fast-cast defenses against mundane threats work if the level of the spell is high enough to neutralize the threat.

<span id="geremonial-casting"></span>
=== Geremonial Casting ===

A maga may spend fifteen minutes for every magnitude of the spell performing rituals to invoke the powers of natural magic. As a result, she may add her scores in Artes Liberales and Philosophiae to her Casting Score. A maga may use ceremonial casting even if she has no

experience points in one of the two Abilities, but not if she has no experience points in either.

No matter how good the roll, the level of the spell is limited by the time the maga spent in casting it, to one magnitude per fifteen minutes. However, the casting total may be very high, so the spell may have good Penetration. Thus, if the maga spends one hour preparing, the final spell cannot be higher than fourth magnitude, which means its level cannot be higher than 20. However, if she gets lucky and rolls a 64 on the stress die, the spell will have a Penetration of 12 (32, which is half of 64, minus the maximum spell level of 20) plus half her Technique + Form + Artes Liberales + Philosophiae + Stamina total.

<span id="ceremonial-casting-bonus-add-artes-liberales-and-philosophiae-to-casting-score"></span>
== CEREMONIAL CASTING BONUS: Add Artes Liberales and Philosophiae to Casting Score ==

Characters may also increase the effectiveness of ceremonial casting by using props, and by using a prepared spellcasting space.

The use of props provides a bonus based on the mystical significance of the items used. Large props are the most effective, but are very expensive, because master craftsmen must make them from rare materials. Large props are also difficult to transport. Medium-sized props are the ones magi can create or acquire most easily. Many evocative items that may be found during stories are medium-sized props. Tiny props are expensive because they must be made from precious metals and gemstones that accord with the Arts. Props aid magic, but are not magical items. They may be constructed or repaired by a skilled craftsman (Ability of 5 or more) under the guidance of a magus, without distracting the magus from study. Bonus to Casting Score, for casting with ceremonial props, by prop size:

* +1 for gemstones and other tiny items, that can be carried in a belt pouch by a magus.
* +2 for small props, fifteen of which completely fill a backpack.
* +3 for medium sized props, such that fifteen would completely fill a horse's saddlebags, or a barrel.
* +4 for large props, such that fifteen could only be transported by a wagon
* +5 for props so large that it is impractical to move them from the room in which they are constructed.

As an example, Carmine of Flambeau, the wife of the Primus of Jerbiton, prefers Creo Ignem effects. She wears a ruby necklace and a coral brooch, and uses these as a small ceremonial kit

when casting small effects in cities. Her husband prefers Rego Imaginem magic. He has a medium-sized ceremonial kit, two items of which are a wand made of the crown of a fairy king that he defeated (Imaginem), and his cat familiar (Rego, for this particular cat).

Prepared space reduces the time required to cast spells ceremonially.

Casting time when using ceremonial spaces, in minutes per magnitude:

* Twelve minutes per magnitude: a space that the magus has created as a temporary recourse. For example, a series of chalk circles on the floor of a rented room in a foreign city.
* Nine minutes per magnitude: a space naturally suited to the performance of ceremonial magic. These spaces are often beautiful. For example, a cliff ledge that faces the sunrise, the pinnacle of the covenant's tallest tower at night, or the depths of an autumn forest.
* Six minutes per magnitude: A space that the magus has carefully designed to have suitable architectural features, lines of light and reflection, and appropriate placement of color.
* Three minutes per magnitude: The magus's laboratory, or other place of magical contemplation.
* One minute per magnitude: A room designed solely for ceremonial casting, which contains props of the largest variety, and mystical choreographies permanently inscribed on the floor. Characters with the Mystical Choreography Virtue cast ceremonial magic at this speed regardless of how temporary their prepared space.

<span id="arcane-connections"></span>
== Arcane Connections ==

rcane Connections allow a maga to cast a spell on something she is not currently sensing, as long as she is currently aware of the Arcane Connection. Mystically,

the Arcane Connection is still a part of the target, thus making the spell possible. However, the spell must have a range of Arcane Connection, which makes casting spells like this harder than casting them on a target that is actually present.

One thing— the connection — is an Arcane Connection to something else — the target, if the connection was very closely associated with the target, often by being a part of it. Once the connection is removed from the target, the connection starts to fade. The length of time that the connection lasts depends on the nature of the connection.

Arcane Connections must be stored carefully, or else they become links to different people or places.

== Penetration ==

enetration is the ability of a spell or other magical ability to affect something that has Magic Resistance. If something has no Magic Resistance,

Penetration is irrelevant. A single spell may have several targets, for example all the members of a Group. In that case, any targets without Magic Resistance are affected no matter what the Penetration of the spell, but any targets with Magic Resistance are only affected if the spell Penetrates that target's Magic Resistance.

Any character with the Penetration Ability can use sympathetic magic to increase the Penetration of her magic. The Penetration Bonus starts at one times the character's Penetration Ability, and the multiplier can be increased. This requires that the character have an Arcane Connection to the target of the magic.

The same Arcane Connection can be used to both allow the use of Arcane Connection Range, and to boost Penetration. Only one Arcane Connection can be used to give a bonus to Penetration against a single target, but it is possible to use Arcane Connections on multiple targets to boost the Penetration of a single spell. The spell might then have a different Penetration against each of its targets. Note that a caster might think she has an Arcane Connection to a target, but be mistaken. In that case, the Arcane Connection does &quot;work&quot;, but the increased Penetration is irrelevant as that individual is not targeted by the spell.

Once a character has an Arcane Connection she can use other sympathetic magic to increase the multiplier further. Any number of sympathetic connections may be used, and their bonuses stack. The following table provides some examples, but is not exhaustive. Each troupe should specify the kinds of sympathetic connection it allows, but no single connection should give a bonus of greater than +2.

<span id="forceless-casting"></span>
== Forceless Casting ==

A maga can deliberately ensure the Penetration Total of a spell does not exceed 0. In essence, the maga casts the spell with no more effort than is required to avoid Fatigue and opts not to use her Penetration skill. As most magi have at least a Magic Resistance of 0, she can ensure her spell will not affect them, provided she does not botch. It is not possible for a maga to choose a Penetration Total other than 0, although mystery cults may know secret techniques that permit this, and original research might also reveal a method.

Forceless casting requires no particular skill or effort. It is useful in magical tournaments, or when a maga casts a spell covering a large area and wants to avoid inadvertently affecting any magi who may be within the target area.

<span id="penetration-example"></span>
== Penetration Example ==

For example, Mari Amwithig wants to be able to cast Agony of the Beast on the dragon that has been causing problems for the covenant. She has a Penetration score of 3, specialized in Perdo, so it is effectively 4. That would typically give her a Penetration of around 20, because she can expect to exceed the spell level by 16 on most rolls. That isn't enough to affect the dragon.

The first thing she does is obtain an Arcane Connection to the dragon, and fix it in the laboratory. This gives her a bonus of +4 to the Penetration multiplier, so now her Penetration score is multiplied by 5 (1 + 4) when determining her penetration bonus. Her typical penetration is now around 36, which is better but still not quite good enough, she thinks.

Mari's player argues that dragons have horoscopes just like anyone else, and the storyguide agrees. Unfortunately, Mari has no idea when, or even if, the dragon was born, so she can only make a daily horoscope. That increases the Penetration multiplier by +1, so her Penetration score is now multiplied by 6. This makes her typical Penetration total 40.

Mari has also Mastered the spell (see page 225) and taken the Penetration Mastery special ability. She has a score of 1 in the Mastery Ability for the spell, and this adds to her Penetration score, so that instead of multiplying 4 by 6, she multiplies 5 (4 for Penetration, 1 for the Mastery Ability) by 6. This raises her typical penetration total to 46, which she thinks will be enough to get the dragon's attention. Arcane Connection and horoscope in hand, she sets off.

<span id="magic-resistance"></span>
== Magic Resistance ==

ost human beings have no Magic Resistance. If the target of a spell has no Magic Resistance, then he suffers its effects no matter how low the Penetration total, even if

it is negative. Humans can gain general Magic Resistance from three sources: the Divine, the Infernal, and Hermetic magic. No other magical or faerie powers are able to provide general Magic Resistance to humans, but creatures with a Might score have Magic Resistance equal to their Might (see page 427).

Hermetic magi have a base Magic Resistance equal to their score in the Form most applicable to the spell cast. In case of doubt, Vim is a safe default. Thus, a maga attacked with magical fire would have Magic Resistance at least equal to her Ignem score. Since all Hermetic magi have a score of at least 0 in every Form, a maga never has a Magic Resistance of less than zero.

If the target of a spell has Magic Resistance of 0, she is only affected if the Penetration total is 1 or greater. Thus, Magic Resistance 0 is substantially better than no Magic Resistance.

<span id="parma-magica"></span>
== Parma Magica ==

The Parma Magica, Bonisagus's great invention, is an Ability that grants Magic Resistance that adds to the resistance arising from a maga's Form scores.

Parma Magica adds Magic Resistance equal to five times the maga's score in the Ability to the resistance based on her Forms. It takes two minutes to perform the Parma Magica ritual, and the Magic Resistance granted lasts until sunset or sunrise, whichever comes first. A magus can suppress his Parma by concentrating, and this also suppresses his Form resistance. This suppression lasts for as long as the magus concentrates, which takes the same effort as concentration on maintaining a spell, and leaves him with no Magic Resistance against anything.

An unconscious magus may not suppress his Parma, and thus has his full resistance against all magic, even helpful magic. His Parma will go down naturally at sunrise or sunset, at which point he has only the resistance based on his Forms. There is no way for an unconscious magus to lower his Form resistance.

A magus may also protect one other person for each point in Parma Magica, with their consent. He must touch each person to start the protection, and it lasts as long as at least one character can see the other. The magus may cancel the protection at will, at any distance.

While a magus is protecting others, his effective Parma Magica score is reduced by 3 points, both for himself and for the other people he is protecting. If the magus has a Parma Magica score of 3 or lower, his Parma Magica provides each character, including himself, with a Magic Resistance of 0. In the magus's case, this is added to his Form resistance, and a magus protected by another magus's Parma Magica may also add his Form resistance.

<span id="awareness-of-attack"></span>
== Awareness of Attack ==

If a spell is stopped by Magic Resistance, the target knows that some effect has been stopped, but knows nothing about it. If a spell penetrates her Magic Resistance, she gets no warning other than any obvious effects the spell has. A very subtle spell might well go completely unnoticed if cast successfully.

<span id="the-functioning-of-magic-resistance"></span>
== The Functioning of Magic Resistance ==

Magic Resistance keeps magic away from the maga, her clothing, and other items that are very close to her. It does not dispel magic.

Spells cast with Personal Range do not have to overcome the caster's own Magic Resistance. Spells cast with any other Range, even if cast by the maga on herself, do have to overcome the caster's own Magic Resistance.

If the maga is the Individual target of the spell, a resisted spell simply fails to work. If she is part of a Group or large Target, the spell fails to work on her, but may affect other people within the target.

If the target of the spell is a magical thing, which then attempts to damage the maga, the spell works, but the created thing is unable to affect the maga unless it Penetrates her Magic Resistance.

Things that are created and sustained by magic (anything not created as a mundane thing by a Ritual spell) are magical for these purposes. Things moved by magic can cross the resistance, but their motion cannot, unless the spell Penetrates the Magic Resistance.

In all the following examples, the Penetration of the magical effect is assumed to be equal to or lower than the maga's Magic Resistance.

A mind control spell targeted at the maga alone fails.

A mind control spell targeted at a group including the maga fails to affect the maga, but may affect other members of the group.

A jet of magical water parts around the maga, and she does not even get wet.

A jet of normal water driven by magic reaches the maga and makes her wet, but has no force of impact, as the magical power cannot pass her resistance.

A quantity of normal water magically raised over the maga's head and dropped makes her wet and strikes with impact, because it is not being moved by magic when it reaches the maga.

A magical rock thrown at the maga bounces off her resistance, and the maga feels nothing beyond the warning that something has been successfully resisted.

A normal rock turned into a large boulder by a Muto spell bounces off her resistance, as above.

A large boulder turned into a pebble by a Muto spell bounces off her resistance, as above.

A normal rock continuously propelled by magic stops at her skin or clothes. The maga feels the warning that something has been resisted, and also feels the rock touching her (before it falls), but she is not struck by the rock. It is as if the rock had been moved up against her as slowly and carefully as possible.

A mundane rock launched upwards by magic so that when it falls, it will fall on the maga is not resisted. By the time it strikes the maga, its motion is natural, due to gravity, rather than magical. However, such a rock must be aimed (see below).

If the maga steps onto a magical bridge, it remains and will bear her weight.

If the maga falls onto a magical bridge, she is stopped by the bridge, and takes falling damage.

If the magical bridge falls onto the maga, it is stopped, but does her no damage.

If a maga falls into a pit full of magical spikes, she either slides around the spikes if there is room, or finishes lying on top of them if there is not. She takes normal falling damage, but no damage from the spikes.

The maga cannot see an invisible character, as the species (see Imaginem, page 209) are destroyed before reaching her.

An invisible character cannot touch or exert physical force on the maga, even if the invisibility spell had Personal Range. The maga feels the warning that something has been resisted, but feels nothing else. See the magical bridge examples, earlier, for further discussion.

The maga can see an illusion, as the species emitted are natural rather than magical. She gets no indication that it is an illusion.

The maga can see a magically-created object, as the object generates normal species.

The maga sees something affected by a Rego Imaginem spell in the location intended by the spell, as the species are no longer under magical influence when they reach her.

An illusion cast on the maga fails.

<span id="aiming"></span>
== Aiming ==

A maga may want to cast a spell that affects something else, and only indirectly affects the target. In this case, the target's Magic Resistance is irrelevant, as the spell does not target her. However, while spells always hit their targets, indirect effects may not reach the true target; they must be aimed. If a spell is resisted, as above, it need not be aimed. If it is not resisted, it must be aimed.

<span id="aiming-roll-perception--finesse--die"></span>
== AIMING ROLL: Perception + Finesse + Die ==

The die is a stress die if the maga is under stress, a simple die otherwise. Treat the total as an attack total (see Combat on page 393). If the 'attack' hits, the spell effect is in the right place; what effect this has depends on the spell. The magus does not generate an Attack Advantage even if the spell inflicts damage; the damage is determined by rolling a stress die and adding the spell's damage bonus, and comparing it to the target's Soak Total + stress die.

If the direct target of the spell is a basic Individual for the Form in question (see page 310), there is no bonus to the aiming roll. For every step larger, and thus for every magnitude added to the spell, the aiming roll gets a +6 bonus. It is hard to miss a single person when you create a pit the size of a church.

For extreme cases, the troupe should use its judgment and may change the bonus. For example, a basic Individual in Auram could be a cloud 100 paces across, which should grant a large bonus to aiming, while a gemstone created two steps larger than a basic Individual is still only 10 inches or so across, and so should probably grant no bonus at all.

<span id="bypassing-magic-resistance"></span>
== Bypassing Magic Resistance ==

The following are examples of spells that bypass the ultimate victim's Magic Resistance, and thus need to be aimed.

* Moving a boulder over the victim's head with Rego Terram, and then dropping it.
* Destroying the earth underneath her feet so that she falls into a pit.
* Creating a wooden box around her so that she cannot see or move.
* Changing the earth under her feet into mud, so that she sinks. Note that she will not get muddy unless the spell penetrates her Magic Resistance, as the mud is a magical substance which is kept away from her.
* Destroying all the air around her so that she cannot breathe (briefly, but enough to force a Concentration roll), and suffers some damage from the surrounding air rushing in to fill the vacuum.

<span id="projectiles-and-rego-magic"></span>
== Projectiles and Rego Magic ==

The laws of physics in Mythic Europe conform to medieval ideas, not modern ones. The differences are often unimportant, but they become significant when a magus uses Rego spells to throw projectiles or to drop heavy objects from a height. The physics (or &quot;natural philosophy&quot; as characters would call it) of Mythic Europe is described in more detail in ''Art &amp; Academe''. This insert clarifies a narrow topic: how to use Rego spells as a form of attack.

In fact, there are three different ways Rego magic may be used offensively.

The first way is to use magic to propel the projectile all the way to the target. In this case, the motive force of the projectile is entirely due to magic. Magic Resistance would protect against this form of attack. The projectile would stop harmlessly at the edge of the target's Magic Resistance. This sort of spell does not need to be aimed.

The second form of attack is to exploit what philosophers call &quot;natural motion:&quot; the natural tendency of heavy objects to fall downward. A magus could use Rego magic to levitate a rock over someone's head and then cancel the spell. The rock would naturally fall and would bypass Magic Resistance. Such a spell would need to be aimed.

The third way is to use a brief jolt of magical force to hurl a projectile as an arrow is thrown from a bow. Medieval natural philosophy did offer an explanation for how an arrow could continue moving after it leaves the bow. To over-simplify (in the interest of brevity), it involves the motion of air around the arrow. Magi can devise spells that hurl projectiles in this manner. Only specially-designed Rego spells can throw projectiles this way — the spell's description must explicitly state that it can throw projectiles (these spells are higher magnitude than generic Rego spells). Spells that throw a projectile release control of it immediately after launching it. The projectile then continues on a natural trajectory. In game terms, this means the spell must be aimed, but the projectile bypasses Magic Resistance. The Range of the spell need only be Touch (the magic only needs to act at the moment the projectile is thrown), but once launched, the projectile is subject to the natural laws of motion. The aiming roll suffers a range penalty just like a missile weapon does (page 395) and the projectile can go no farther than it could be thrown by a very powerful mundane bow (or sling, catapult, or other device). Most projectiles thrown by spells have a range increment of 20 paces.

<span id="sigils"></span>
== Sigils ==

very Hermetic maga has a 'wizard's sigil'. All the spells that she casts have something in common, which makes it clear to those who know her

that she was the caster. The sigil also appears in the effects of enchanted devices created by the maga.

Some sigils affect the environment where the spell is cast. For example, a maga might have the scent of orange blossom as her sigil. In that case, whenever she casts a spell there is a smell of orange blossom in the area. The spell has its effect as normal. Another maga's sigil might make everyone nearby feel briefly chilled.

Other sigils affect the maga herself. For example, a sigil might make the maga's hair stand on end and flash with sparks, or make her eyes glow briefly.

Finally, some sigils affect the actual products of the spell. A maga's sigil might mean that all her spell effects involve whiteness in some way, whether white fire from Creo Ignem, or a white patch on animals affected by Muto Animal.

Whatever the form of the sigil, it never requires requisites, as it is part of the maga's magic. Accordingly, it should never be something useful, nor something that imposes major problems. It is a bit of flavor for the caster, nothing more.

All kinds of sigil leave some traces behind in the magic, and skilled Hermetic investigators can use this sigil to find out who cast a spell.

Hermetic magi also have a voting sigil, a small physical object which identifies them and is used to vote at Tribunal. This often resembles the casting sigil in some way, but need not.

<span id="spell-mastery"></span>
== Spell Mastery ==

ermetic magi can study Formulaic and Ritual spells that they know in more detail. This study leads to spell mastery. Magi can write books about

spells they have mastered, to convey that knowledge to others. The Spell Mastery Ability can be learned from such books according to the normal rules for study (see page 378). Spell mastery Abilities are their own category, and Virtues that give characters access to other categories of Ability do not cover spell mastery Abilities. They may only be learned by characters who use Hermetic magic to cast spells.

For every possible Hermetic spell, there is a corresponding Ability. This Ability can be studied in the normal ways, and is called the spell's mastery ability. If a maga has a score of one or greater in a mastery ability, she is said to have mastered that spell.

Mastery Ability: Adds to casting score and subtracts from number of botch dice

A maga adds her score in the mastery ability to her casting score whenever she casts that spell. In addition, she subtracts her mastery ability from the number of botch dice she has to roll if she rolls a zero. This may bring the number of dice down to zero. Mastered spells are always cast with a stress die, but if the maga is relaxed there are no botch dice, even in a non-Magic aura or when using vis, or when casting a Ritual spell.

<span id="mastered-spell-special-abilities"></span>
== Mastered Spell Special Abilities ==

For every level in the Mastery Ability, the maga may also choose one special ability, which applies only to that mastered spell. Thus, a maga with a Mastery Score of two for a spell has two special abilities for that spell. A maga who has mastered more than one spell may have different special abilities with each of them.

<span id="adaptive-casting"></span>
== Adaptive Casting ==

You may use your mastery score and all the special abilities associated with it whenever you cast a similar spell (as defined in the Laboratory chapter, page 260). If you have two or more mastery Abilities that apply to a single spell (because you have mastered two or more spells that are similar

to the spell you are casting) you may only use the score of one Ability, and the special abilities taken for that mastery Ability. For example, if you have mastered ''Demon's Eternal Oblivion'' 30 with a score of 3, and the abilities Adaptive, Fast Casting, and Penetration, and ''Demon's Eternal Oblivion'' 25 with a score of 4 and the abilities Adaptive, Quiet Casting twice, and Still Casting, you must use the score of 3 if you want to use the Penetration ability, and the score of 4 if you want to use the Still Casting ability, and you cannot use the Penetration ability with the score of 4.

<span id="ceremonial-casting"></span>
== Ceremonial Casting ==

The maga may apply the rules for Ceremonial Casting (page 217) to casting this spell. This special ability may not be taken for Ritual spells, as they effectively use ceremonial casting to start with.

This special ability is not widely known in the Order, having originated with the Cult of Mercury, but it is no longer a secret of the cult. They know other special abilities that do remain secrets of the cult, however (see ''The Mysteries, Revised Edition'', page 117).

<span id="fast-casting-1"></span>
=== Fast Casting ===

The maga may Fast Cast the mastered spell according to the rules for Fast Casting Spontaneous spells, on page 217. The maga still takes the –10 penalty to Casting Score and risks the extra botch dice, although the botch dice will be partially offset by her Mastery Ability. Any or all of your Mastery Abilities may be applied to the spell even when it is fast-cast, as these abilities are a fundamental part of your understanding of the spell. This special ability may not be taken for Ritual spells.

<span id="imperturbable-casting"></span>
== Imperturbable Casting ==

Add the caster's Mastery score to all Concentration rolls related to the spell. This helps her maintain spells of Concentration Duration amid the chaos of battle, or while casting another spell (see the Concentration Table, page 215).

<span id="magic-resistance-1"></span>
== Magic Resistance ==

Your Magic Resistance is doubled against the mastered spell, and against any spells or powers that count as similar. (See 'Similar Spells', page 260)

<span id="multiple-casting"></span>
== Multiple Casting ==

You can cast several copies of a single mastered spell so that it affects more people, objects, or areas (as applicable) than normal. A single target may also be affected more than once. You may cast a number of additional copies of the spell equal to or less than your Mastery Score.

All copies of the spell are cast simultaneously, and the action counts as a single casting for the purposes of Concentration and similar concerns. Each copy must be rolled for separately. If any of the copies fail outright, you lose the fatigue and the copy fails, though others may still take effect successfully. If you lose consciousness, any copies that were successful still run their course. If you lose consciousness and accumulate additional fatigue loss, each additional Fatigue level causes an extra hour of unconsciousness. Any special cost, beyond the standard casting requirements, must be paid for each copy of the spell.

Subtract the total number of discrete targets from any aiming rolls that are required. Even if all spells are directed at the same target, a -1 applies. The storyguide can further penalize or prohibit multiple casting that is especially difficult, such as casting two spells in opposite directions.

Penalty of one for every separate target, including the first

This special ability may be taken for Ritual spells. The casting time is that for a single spell, but one pawn of appropriate vis per magnitude of the spell must be expended for each copy. The normal limit on pawns of vis expended (the maga's score in the Art) applies. Excess Fatigue levels lost convert to wounds, as normal for Ritual spells.

<span id="obfuscated-casting"></span>
== Obfuscated Casting ==

Magi cannot automatically identify the Form of the spell as the magus casts it. This makes it difficult for them to use fast-cast spells as a defense. They must always roll to determine the Form of the spell (see page 217) and must add the caster's Mastery score to the Ease Factor.

<span id="penetration-1"></span>
== Penetration ==

The maga's Mastery Score is added to her Penetration Ability score for determining her Penetration Bonus (see page 219).

<span id="precise-casting"></span>
== Precise Casting ==

Add +1 to all Finesse rolls the caster makes with the spell, including aiming rolls. Subtract one botch die from any Finesse rolls she makes using the spell, to a minimum of one botch die. A maga may take this ability multiple times for the same spell.

<span id="quick-casting"></span>
== Quick Casting ==

Add +1 to the caster's Initiative Total when he casts the mastered spell. If he also has the Fast Casting special ability, add +1 to his Fast Casting Speed rolls (page 217) when he fast-casts the spell. This ability cannot be taken for Ritual spells. A magus may take this ability multiple times for the same spell.

<span id="quiet-casting"></span>
== Quiet Casting ==

The penalty for casting a spell quietly is reduced by five. This cannot grant a bonus, although using a booming voice gives the normal bonus. A maga may take this ability twice. If she does so, she can cast the spell silently without penalty. The range of a Voice Range spell is still based on the actual loudness of the maga's voice.

<span id="rebuttal"></span>
==== Rebuttal ====

This Mastery special ability may be applied to any Muto or Rego Vim spell designed to affect a spell or power used by another being (thus Wizard's Boost or Maintain the Demanding Spell are not eligible, but Mirror of Opposition [Form] is). The magus may add three times his Mastery score to the effective level of the Vim spell when determining whether or not it can change or control the foreign magic.

<span id="still-casting"></span>
== Still Casting ==

The maga can cast the spell without gestures, at no penalty. The normal bonus for using exaggerated gestures applies.

<span id="unravelling"></span>
== Unravelling ==

This Mastery special ability may be applied to any Perdo Vim spell designed to weaken or destroy magic. The magus may add three times his Mastery score to the effective level of the Perdo Vim spell when determining whether it can destroy the targeted effect. Thus a 20th level Wind of Mundane Silence cast by a character with this Mastery special ability and a score of 3 can negate the effects of a spell if he can double the spell's level on (29 + stress die) rather than (20 + stress die).

<span id="books-on-spell-mastery"></span>
== Books on Spell Mastery ==

A book on spell Mastery can be studied by anyone who knows the spell that the book is about. For the purposes of spell Mastery, two spells are the same if they have the same Arts, level, Range, Duration, Target, and effect, essentially, if the game rule versions of the two spells are identical. Different wizard's sigils are not a problem.

Because magi reinvent spells for themselves, rather than actually learning another magus's version, a magus studying spell Mastery from a book may learn any special ability, not just the abilities known by the original author. The book provides insight into the structure of the spell, but that insight may differ slightly between the author's and reader's versions of the spells.

<span id="dangers"></span>
== Dangers ==

espite the Order's attempts to regulate it and make it a science, magic remains an art. No matter how skilled a practitioner you are, and no

matter what precautions you take (short of not using magic at all), your magic will sometimes get out of your control. From the danger of casting a spell improperly to the danger of the enigmatic Wizard's Twilight, magic is filled with hazards.

<span id="botches"></span>
== Botches ==

The most common danger magi face when performing magic is a botch. The results of a given spell cast under stress are not entirely predictable, and a botch on a spell roll means that the maga has made a mistake that, rather than just causing her spell to fail, causes her spell to produce different effects than she intended. Though the effects of botches can vary widely, they are almost universally detrimental. The storyguide should use his imagination when determining botches.

As noted above (page 213), a botch automatically gives a maga a Casting Total of zero. However, this does not mean that nothing happens, in general, the spell still goes off. The magic is beyond the maga's control, almost anything could happen. More powerful spells should have more powerful botch results, in general, but as usual the number of botch dice that come up zero should determine just how badly things have gone wrong.

Magi gain one Warping Point for every zero that comes up on the botch dice when casting a spell. (This does not include the original zero that meant the botch dice had to be rolled. If the roll does not botch, the magus gains no Warping Points.) If a magus gains two or more Warping Points from a single spell botch, he may enter Wizard's Twilight (see below).

<span id="botch-suggestions"></span>
== Botch Suggestions ==

Attract unwanted attention: The attention of someone or something, perhaps the target of your spell, is drawn to you.

Caster addled: You are rendered insane, confused, or demented. You acquire the Flaw Simple-Minded for an indefinite duration.

Caster overwhelmed: You are overwhelmed by your own magic. Make a Stamina stress roll of 6+ or be knocked unconscious.

<span id="sources-of-botch-dice"></span>
== Sources of Botch Dice ==

When casting a spell under stress, you start with one botch die, as normal. The storyguide can increase this for all the normal reasons, such as distractions or a difficult magical environment, but there are several standard modifiers to the number of botch dice for spell casting.

'''Using vis while casting''': +1 botch die per pawn of vis used

Casting in a supernatural aura other than Magic: +1 botch die per level of the aura, doubled if in a regio

Fast Casting: +2 botch dice

Golden Cord to a familiar: -1 botch die per level

Spell Mastery: -1 botch die per level

Note that there are a number of Virtues and Flaws that can modify both the number of botch dice, and what they mean. For example, the Faerie Magic Virtue attunes Merinita magi to Faerie auras, so that they do not gain additional botch dice in them.

If the maga is relaxed while casting a Formulaic spell, then there are no botch dice, no matter how many the circumstances would normally add. Note that it is not possible to be relaxed while casting a fatiguing Spontaneous spell, as the process itself is stressful. Ritual spells also require botch dice in all circumstances, unless the maga has mastered them.

Connection with target: Your target becomes aware of your investigations, and may learn something about you through the arcane link that is temporarily established.

'''Debilitating''': The spell pushes the target too hard and does permanent damage: for example, a Rego Animal spell might forever leave a beast without its natural instincts and urges.

Flawed creation: A creation is heavily flawed, though the flaw may not be obvious until the creation is expected to serve the function it was created for.

Incomplete or improper effect: For example, a spell intended to transform you into a wolf might only transform your head and hands.

Out of control: The spell creates or calls forth something beyond the caster's ability to control.

Related but unwanted effect: For example, a spell intended to transform you into a wolf might turn you into another animal.

Reverse effect: The spell does exactly the opposite of what is intended.

'''Spell affects caster:''' You, instead of the intended target, are affected.

Too powerful: The spell does more than it should and thereby causes problems.

'''Undying spell''': The spell does not end at the normal time, and it proves resistant to being dispelled.

Wrong target: Pick a new one at random.

<span id="carping"></span>
== Carping ==

Warping affects everyone, not just Hermetic magi, so it is described in the Long Term Events chapter, page 389. Note that magi gain one Warping Point for every zero on the botch dice when they botch a spell.

<span id="wizards-twilight"></span>
== Wizard's Twilight ==

Wizard's Twilight is unique to Hermetic magic. Most magical traditions have a unique reaction to Warping, and Wizard's Twilight is the reaction of magi trained in the Hermetic tradition.

<span id="entering-twilight"></span>
== Entering Twilight ==

Whenever a maga gains two or more Warping Points from a single event, rather than from prolonged exposure, she must add them to her current total, possibly increasing her Warping Score, and then roll to avoid Twilight.

TWILIGHT AVOIDANCE:

Stamina + Concentration + Vim Form Bonus + stress die vs. Warping Score + Number of Warping Points gained + Enigmatic Wisdom + local aura + stress die (no botch)

If the roll succeeds, the maga spends two minutes (one Diameter) bringing her magic under control, but there are no further effects. If the roll fails, the maga enters Wizard's Twilight. If the maga botches, she enters Twilight and cannot comprehend the experience.

A maga may choose not to resist Twilight, in which case she makes no roll and automatically enters Twilight. In some situations, such as combat, taking two minutes to control the magic may be very dangerous, and in such cases a maga may wish to enter Twilight in the hope of comprehending it and thus getting through the experience more quickly.

<span id="comprehending-twilight"></span>
== Comprehending Twilight ==

A maga within Twilight must comprehend her surroundings in order to get out.

TWILIGHT COMPREHENSION: Intelligence + Enigmatic Wisdom + stress die vs. Warping Score + stress die

BOTCH DICE:

1 + 1 per Warping Point gained to trigger the Twilight

The time that a maga feels that she spends in Twilight is completely independent of time

passing in the real world. The time that passes in the real world depends on the maga's Warping Score, and the success of her Twilight Comprehension roll.

If the comprehension roll botches, the time the maga spends in Twilight increases by one step on the table for each zero rolled, and she suffers a negative effect from the experience.

If the comprehension roll fails, the maga spends the base time in Twilight, and suffers a bad effect from the experience.

If the Twilight side of the comprehension roll botches (same botch dice as the maga's side), the maga need only beat a total of zero to comprehend the Twilight. The botch has no other effect. This means that, all else being equal, a maga is slightly more likely to comprehend a Twilight caused by gaining a lot of Warping Points.

If the comprehension roll succeeds, subtract the maga's Enigmatic Wisdom score from the result, and compare that total (that is, the maga's Intelligence plus the stress die result) to the Twilight's result.

TWILIGHT TIME: Intelligence + stress die vs. Warping Score + stress die

Note: The die rolls are the rolls already made to comprehend the Twilight

If the two match exactly, or the maga's score is lower, the maga spends the base time in Twilight. For every additional point by which the maga's score exceeds the Twilight result, move one step shorter on the duration table. For example, if a maga with a Warping score of 7 makes her comprehension roll by three points, the Twilight lasts a day. If this lowers the duration below Diameter, the whole Twilight lasts a mere moment in the real world.

<span id="during-twilight"></span>
== During Twilight ==

The experiences of magae in Twilight vary enormously. Some experience a dreamlike copy of the real world. Others encounter strange creatures, or copies of themselves, or feel an infinite benevolence watching over the universe, or an infinite malevolence likewise. These may be played out if desired.

The effects are equally varied in the outside world. The simplest effect is that the maga falls unconscious until she emerges from the Twilight. This is most common with low Warping scores. Magae with moderate Warping Scores often seem to resist Twilight, but act without real initiative. They are easily led while in this state, and have no memory of their actions when the Twilight finishes. Magae with high Warping Scores sometimes disappear physically into the Twilight Void. If they do so, their bodies reappear in the same place, near enough, when they come out of Twilight.

If the maga's body remains in the real world while she is in Twilight, it is completely immune to magic, mundane damage, aging, and hunger. In many ways it seems to be outside the world although it still appears within it. A maga's body is also unable to perform magic while she is in Twilight.

While these are the most common effects, others

have been observed. Bjornaer often take the form of their heartbeasts, and Flambeau magi have been known to turn into large fires which burn without fuel.

<span id="effects-of-twilight"></span>
== '''Effects of Twilight''' ==

Every Twilight experience marks the maga. The strength of the mark is random. Roll a simple die. The maga gains that many Warping Points, in addition to the points that triggered the Twilight.

If the maga comprehended the Twilight, the effects are good.

Twilight Scar: Something minor and magical, and also neutral or beneficial. For example, the area around the maga always smells faintly and pleasantly of roses, the maga's eyes glitter with many colors, the maga walks a fraction of an inch above any surface. In the case of a maga who wants to keep her magic inconspicuous, the effect may not be obviously magical: people around her become slightly more cheerful, insects don't bite her, and so on.

In addition, the storyguide should pick one of the following effects:

Increased Knowledge: A number of experience points in an Art, Magic Theory, or Enigmatic Wisdom, equal to twice the number of Warping Points gained.

New Hermetic or Supernatural Virtue: Minor (if between 7 and 10 Warping Points, inclusive), or major (if more than ten Warping Points). Virtues cannot be gained if the maga gains fewer than seven Warping Points.

New Spell: The maga knows a new Formulaic or Ritual spell, with a magnitude equal to the number of Warping Points gained. This spell is chosen by the storyguide, and the maga need not be able to cast it. She may write a Lab Text about it as normal.

If the maga failed to comprehend the Twilight, the effects are bad.

Twilight Scar: Something minor, magical, and annoying. For example, the area around the maga smells faintly of sulfur, the maga's touch stains skin black (it washes off, with effort), the maga's footprints create myriads of fine cracks in any surface. At the storyguide's discretion, a maga who tries to keep her magic inconspicuous might get a scar she can hide. For example, the smell of iron makes her feel nauseous, or insects always bite her given the chance.

In addition, the storyguide should pick one of the following effects:

Lost Knowledge: Lose two experience points for every Warping Point gained in an Art, Magic Theory, or Enigmatic Wisdom. This cannot reduce the score below zero.

New Hermetic or Supernatural Flaw: Minor (if between 7 and 10 Warping Points, inclusive) or major (if 10 Warping Points or above). The maga can only gain a Flaw if she gains at least seven Warping Points.

Lost Spells: The maga loses the knowledge of spells, chosen by the storyguide, with magnitudes totaling the number of Warping Points gained.

<span id="certamen"></span>
== Certamen ==

Certamen (Care-TAH-men, Latin for &quot;duel&quot;) is the ceremony by which two magi conduct a magical duel. It serves as a nonlethal way for one magus to establish dominance and precedence over another, and has formal restrictions to keep it from disrupting the unity of the Order.

The most important is that certamen cannot be used to over-rule a Tribunal, require a violation of the Code, or require a magus to overlook a violation of the Code. Beyond that, however, certamen can be used to settle any dispute, and the result of the certamen is binding.

One need not accept a challenge to certamen, but that is the same as conceding defeat. You may challenge anyone to certamen over a certain issue once, but the Peripheral Code prohibits you from challenging the same person again over that issue unless he challenges you in the meantime. If

<span id="twilight-example"></span>
== Twilight Example ==

Darius of Flambeau, played by Niall, botches a spell while hunting a Renounced magus. There are two zeroes on the botch dice, so he gains 2 Warping Points, and must check for Twilight. Darius has a Warping Score of 6, and his enemy is not immediately present, so he chooses to try to resist the Twilight.

As a member of House Flambeau, Darius does not have an Enigmatic Wisdom score, so that doesn't affect anything.

Darius has a Stamina of 0, Concentration 3, and a Vim bonus of 2. He thus gets +5 to his roll to resist the Twilight, and Niall rolls a six on the stress die, for a total of 11. Not bad, but not great.

The Ease Factor is 6 (for his Warping Score) +2 (the number of points gained) + 4 (for the local Faerie aura, a major contributor to the botch in the first place), or 12 + a stress die, no botch. The storyguide doesn't bother rolling, even if he rolls a zero Darius has failed to resist and will enter Twilight.

When it comes to comprehending the Twilight, Darius gets his Intelligence, +3, plus a stress die.

The Twilight has a base of 6, Darius's Warping Score, plus a stress die. Niall rolls a 7, but the storyguide rolls a 5. Darius has a total of 10, and the Twilight has a total of 11. Darius has failed to comprehend it.

The comprehension roll simply failed, so Darius spends the base time in Twilight, and has a bad experience. At a Warping Score of 6, the base time is one season.

The storyguide rules that Darius feels his magic destroying his body and mind from the inside. He can't tell how long it takes, although he is fully aware of every step of the process, and as the last trace of his awareness is about to vanish, he comes out of the Twilight. To the outside world, Darius's body appeared to dry up and decay to dust over the course of a few seconds. At the end of a season, Darius reappears, and finds that two of the covenant grogs have been camping here to see whether he was coming back from Twilight.

The simple die for additional Warping Points is a one, so Darius gains three Warping Points in total. He loses six experience points in Corpus, two for each of the three Warping Points he gained. He didn't gain enough Warping Points to gain a Flaw. He also gains a Twilight Scar, and the storyguide rules that any dead meat Darius is touching looks, tastes, and smells rotten, although the effect passes when he releases it, and the meat is actually perfectly good. It looks like Darius will be becoming a vegetarian.

another issue comes up, you may challenge him again. Bullying magi with certamen is a Low Crime in almost all Tribunals. Certamen is solely an institution of the Order of Hermes; non-Hermetic wizards do not have the ability to participate in the ceremony, as it relies heavily on the Hermetic Arts.

Both participants specify in advance what the other magus will do, or refrain from doing, if he loses. The two requirements are expected to be symmetrical, and Tribunals do over-ride the results on asymmetric certamens. This gives magi some motivation not to bully with certamen; even the greatest archmage can botch.

To engage in certamen, you and the other magus must agree on one Form and Technique combination you will both use. By tradition, the aggressor in the duel chooses the Technique and the defender chooses the Form, and it is considered good form to go along with this choice. However, each magus may veto the other magus's first choice. If he does so, he must accept the second option.

Once the Technique and Form are chosen, you and your opponent concentrate for a moment, both entering trances. While entranced, competing magi have no defense against physical attacks. Each becomes attuned to the magical forces surrounding them, shaping them into phantasms representing the Technique and Form of the duel. If the Technique and Form are Muto and Animal, the phantasms might be two animals, one controlled by each magus. During the course of the duel, each animal changes into various other animals in an effort to defeat the other. A Creo Ignem contest could consist of two fiery beings fighting. In an Intellego Aguam contest it might appear that the combatants are in hazy water, each trying to reach some goal. The illusionary battle is a representation of the more subtle magical battle which affects the minds of the combatants.

Mechanical resolution of certamen is based on six totals.

INITIATIVE TOTAL:

Quickness + Finesse + Stress Die

ATTACK TOTAL:

Presence + Technique or Form + Stress Die Defense Total:

Perception + Form or Technique + Stress Die

ATTACK ADVANTAGE: Attack Total - Defense Total (if Attack Total is higher)

Weakening Total: Intelligence + Penetration + Attack Advantage

RESISTANCE TOTAL: Stamina + Parma Magica

Initiative is rolled only once, at the beginning of the duel. This initiative is the same as combat initiative (see page 393), and if a certamen is taking place during combat, each magus acts at the point in the sequence determined by his initiative total. On his action, a magus rolls a stress die to generate an Attack Total. His opponent rolls a stress die to generate a Defense Total. Unlike initiative, the dice for attack and defense are rolled every round. If the Defense Total equals or exceeds the Attack Total, the attack does no damage. If the Attack Total exceeds the Defense Total, the amount by which it does so is the Attack Advantage.

Each magus must use both the Technique and the Form in each round of certamen, using one for Attack and the other for Defense. The two magi may use different Arts from each other for Attack or Defense, and may change which Art they apply to which total from round to round.

Subtract the defender's Resistance Total from the Weakening Total. For every five points or fraction left over, the defender loses a Fatigue level. Note that the magus's Parma Magica score is added to the Resistance Total; it is not multiplied by five as it is for Magic Resistance.

<span id="certamen-example"></span>
== ''Certamen Example'' ==

Moratamis of Guernicus harbors suspicions about what Carolus of Tytalus gets up to at night. She asks him to tell her what he is doing, and he refuses. She doesn't have enough for an official Quaesitorial investigation, so she challenges him to certamen, demanding that he tell her what he has done if he loses. Carolus agrees, with the condition that Moratamis will not ask him about his activities again unless she is on official Quaesitorial business. (He has to add the condition, although he would prefer not to, or else the Tribunal is unlikely to uphold a result in his favor.) Carolus suspects he will lose, as Moratamis is older and thus more powerful.

'''Moratamis's Arts are:''' Cr 1, In 12, Mu 1, Pe 7, Re 8; An 5, Aq 0, Au 0, Co 5, He 0, Ig 0, Im 10, Me 13, Te 0, Vi 5

Her Characteristics are: Int +2, Per +3, Pre +2, Com +1, Str -2, Sta +1, Dex –2, Qik –1

Her relevant Abilities are: Finesse 2, Parma Magica 5, Penetration 3.

'''Carolus's Arts are:''' Cr 2, In 0, Mu 5, Pe 10, Re 7; An 3, Aq 0, Au 0, Co 5, He 0, Ig 0, Im 10, Me 7, Te 6, Vi 4

His Characteristics are: Int +2, Per –1, Pre –1, Com –1, Str 0, Sta +1, Dex +4, Qik 0

His relevant Abilities are: Finesse 2, Parma Magica 3, Penetration 1.

Moratamis challenged, so she picks the Technique. She is fairly sure that the only Technique she is much better at is Intellego, and she's also sure that Carolus knows this too. She thinks that her scores in Rego and Creo are fairly balanced with Carolus's, though. She knows that, if she proposes Intellego first, Carolus will veto it. On the other hand, if she proposes Rego first, Carolus might have other reasons to veto that, and thus let her use Intellego. Thus, she proposes Rego.

Carolus accepts, knowing full well that he'll be stuck with Intellego if he doesn't. For the Form, he proposes Imaginem. He knows that Moratamis studies that, but also that he has a reputation as a bit of an Imaginem specialist. He hopes that she'll think he thinks he has an advantage she doesn't know about. It works;

Moratamis vetoes his first choice. Carolus then settles on Terram, where he is fairly sure he is better.

The two now have the following statistics:

'''Moratamis:''' Initiative: +1 (Qik –1 + Finesse 2), Attack: +10 (Rego: Rego 8 + Pre +2) or +2 (Terram: Terram 0 + Pre +2), Defense +11 (Rego: Rego 8

* Per +3) or +3 (Terram: Terram 0 + Per +3), Weakening +5 (Int +2
* Penetration 3), Resistance +6 (Sta +1 + Parma Magica 5)

'''Carolus:''' Initiative: +2 (Qik 0 + Finesse 2), Attack +6 (Rego: Rego 7

* Pre –1) or +5 (Terram: Terram 6 + Pre –1), Defense +6 (Rego: Rego 7
* Per –1) or +5 (Terram: Terram 6 + Per –1), Weakening +3 (Int +2
* Penetration 1), Resistance +4 (Sta +1 + Parma Magica 3)

The phantasms for the contest are the stones of the floor under their feet, which try to rise up and engulf them.

The two roll Initiative. Moratamis rolls a 2, for a total of 3, and Carolus rolls a 5, for a total of 7. Carolus acts first.

On the first round, Carolus chooses to put Rego into attack and Terram into defense, while Moratamis chooses to defend with Rego and attack with Terram. Carolus attacks first, and rolls a 12 (lucky!), for an Attack Total of 18. Moratamis rolls a 7, for a Defense Total of 18. On a dead heat, the defender wins, and Carolus cannot get through. Then Moratamis attacks. She rolls a 5, for a total of 7, while Carolus rolls a 2, also for a total of 7. Another dead heat, so nothing happens. The stones jump around a bit, but nothing happens.

On the next round, Moratamis switches her Arts, in the hope of breaking through Carolus's defenses. Carolus still attacks first, and rolls a 10, for an Attack Total of 16. Moratamis rolls a zero, but doesn't botch, for a Defense Total of 3. Carolus has an Attack Advantage of 13. This adds to his Weakening Score of +3, for a Weakening Total of 16. Moratamis subtracts her Resistance of 6, so the final damage is 10. Moratamis thus loses two Fatigue levels, giving her a –1 penalty on Attack and Defense.

On her attack, Moratamis rolls a 2, for an Attack Total of 11, including the –1 penalty. Carolus rolls a 6, for a Defense Total of 11. Thanks to having already weakened Moratamis, he beats off the attack. The stones have climbed up to around Moratamis's knees.

Moratamis decides that her switch of strategy was a mistake, and switches back. Carolus rolls a 20 (lucky again!) for an Attack Total of 26. Moratamis rolls an 8, for a Defense Total of 18. Carolus has an Attack Advantage of 8, which translates into a single Fatigue level lost. Moratamis now has a –3 penalty to Attack and Defense.

She rolls a 7, which gives her an Attack Total of 6. Carolus rolls a 4, for a Defense Total of 9, easily safe.

Moratamis is now hoping for a lucky break, and Carolus only rolls a 6, for an Attack Total of 12. Moratamis rolls a 6, for a Defense Total of 14, including the penalty. She is safe this round. For her counterattack, she rolls a 5, for an Attack Total of 4. Carolus rolls a zero, but doesn't botch, and still has a Defense Total of 5. He is safe, and the stones are swarming up around Moratamis's waist.

The next round remains evenly balanced, neither magus managing to weaken the other. In the following round, Carolus rolls a 9, for an Attack Total of 15, while Moratamis only manages a 4, for a Defense Total of 12. This gives Carolus a Weakening Total of 6, which Moratamis is just able to resist. Still, she feels it and a few stones boil up to her chest for a moment. She rolls a 7 for her attack, for an Attack Total of 6. Carolus rolls a 6, for a Defense Total of 11, and easily blocks the thrust.

In the next round, Carolus rolls a 10, for a total of 16, while Moratamis rolls a 0, but doesn't botch, for a Defense Total of 8. This gives Carolus a final advantage of 2 points, enough to clip a further Fatigue level from Moratamis. Now that she has a penalty of –5 to Attack and Defense, she decides that she cannot win, and concedes the contest so that Carolus cannot cast a spell on her. Carolus goes off feeling that he wriggled out of that one quite nicely, and Moratamis turns her attention to other matters.

''VII''

Certamen itself never causes wounds, merely exhaustion. If you lose more Fatigue levels than you have, you spend one more hour unconscious for every additional level lost.

You can use raw vis at any time during certamen, even if your opponent doesn't use it or doesn't expect its use. For every pawn you expend, add 2 to your Attack Total or Defense Total for one round only. Raw vis used must be attuned to the Art used for Attack or Defense in the duel. The number of pawns you can use in one round is limited to your score in the Form or Technique the vis is attuned to.

All members of House Tremere have a Minor Magical Focus with Certamen. This means that they always double the lower of the Technique and Form when engaged in certamen. Other Magical Foci do not apply.

There are three ways to win certamen. The first involves wearing your opponent down until he falls unconscious. When this happens, the victor is entitled to cast a single spell at the loser. This spell, which must be of the same Technique and Form as the contest, circumvents the loser's Parma Magica (though the loser still gets Magic Resistance based on the Form of the spell). In most certamen contests, this &quot;free&quot; spell is unnecessary, because your opponent's collapse already designates your victory. However, some duelists use it anyway to intimidate and embarrass those who fight them. This free spell can be used to harm your fallen opponent, but remember, certamen is intended to be a harmless way to resolve disputes, and the winner is still bound by the Hermetic Code.

The second way to win certamen is by surrender. If your opponent realizes he is outmatched, or wants to walk away from the duel, he can concede the contest. Such a submission means that the loser is still capable of defending himself, so he has full Parma Magica and Magic Resistance against any final spell cast at him.

The third way to win certamen is to maintain concentration in the face of distraction when your opponent does not. Concentration rolls are not necessitated by the loss of Fatigue levels during certamen. Sometimes, however, conditions surrounding the duel necessitate that the duelists make Concentration rolls. If one of the duelists fails a Concentration roll, the fight ends. The duelist's loss of concentration causes his phantasm to disappear, indicating the opponent's victory. A victor through loss of concentration does not get a free spell.

Loss of concentration, however, does not necessarily mean that certamen is over and that a victor is decided. If the victor under these circumstances refuses the honor, and the combatant who lost concentration agrees, the battle may resume until a clear victor emerges. A magus might refuse a victory by loss of concentration for reasons of honor, or because he intends to do more harm.

<span id="mysteries"></span>
== Mysteries ==

ysteries are paths to greater magical power requiring sacrifices beyond the time for study. Many magi within the Order of Hermes pursue

mysteries, and four of the Houses are Mystery Cults — organizations that teach a mystery. Extensive details on the mysteries of the Hermetic Houses are given in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, while The Mysteries Revised Edition gives extensive information on other mysteries found within the Order of Hermes. This section provides information about the outermost laver of the House mysteries, and one of the deeper mysteries for each House. Player characters in the Mystery Cult Houses are Initiated into the Outer Mystery as apprentices, but must seek Initiation into deeper mysteries in play. Rules for Mystery Initiation are given in the Long-Term Events chapter, on page 387.

<span id="bjornaer--the-leartheast"></span>
== '''Bjornaer''' — The '''Leartheast''' ==

Bjornaer magi can take the form of a single mundane creature. This is usually an animal or bird, but it can be a plant. The heartbeast is always a living thing, and usually a noble creature. No known magus has had an earthworm heartbeast, for example. A maga's heartbeast displays a central aspect of her nature, so that her personality, even in human form, will resemble that of the creature. Initiates of the Bjornaer mystery gain the Ability Heartbeast. This Ability cannot be gained by any character who has not been Initiated into the mystery. For Initiates of the Outer Mystery, the Heartbeast Ability is only used when something tries to stop the magus changing forms. In that case, a roll of Stamina + Heartbeast against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide allows the character to change anyway.

A Bjornaer maga can only change into one kind of animal, and that kind cannot be altered by Hermetic magic. The transformed Bjornaer can be changed, by Muto Animal magic, for example, but the kind of animal that her heartbeast is cannot be changed. A Bjornaer maga really is her heartbeast, and so remaining in that form does not count as being under an active mystical effect (see Warping, page 389). Of course, she is really human as well, so remaining human does not cause Warping either. Hermetic magic is unable to tell whether an animal is actually a Bjornaer,

and the same applies to most other kinds of magic. (This assumes that the maga is trying to hide her nature, of course.) As a result, a Bjornaer in animal form is affected by Animal spells, not Corpus or Mentem spells. Spells already in effect before the transformation remain in effect, however.

Bjornaer magi can cast spells while in the form of their heartbeast, but they cannot speak or make the appropriate gestures, and thus normally take a -15 penalty.

The transformation takes only a moment, and affects only the maga. None of her possessions are transformed. A Bjornaer who has been physically changed by magic may try to

assume her normal form or her heartbeast form. She must roll Stamina + Heartbeast against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide. As a rule of thumb, 3 + the magnitude of the transforming magic is a reasonable number. If she does resume one of her natural forms, the other magic is dispelled.

Bjornaer magi do not treat physical transformations as major magical effects for the purposes of gaining Warping Points. However, a magical transformation which is maintained over time will grant one Warping Point per year, as it is still a continuing mystical effect.

Finally, Bjornaer magi cannot bind familiars. The reasons for this are debated, but the fact is uncontroversial.

INITIATION OF SECRET NAME

Ease Factor: 15 (Minor Virtue known to the Mystagogue)

Script Bonus: +8

Script Details: On the anniversary of the Initiate's birth, the Mystagogue and the Initiate enter a round tent which has been set up on an ancestor site (+3) and perform a ritual cleansing together which must end at the hour of the Initiate's birth (+2); Initiate acquires a minor version of the Weak Magic Resistance Flaw (+3 for Minor Ordeal).

<span id="ringing-the-changes"></span>
== Ringing the Changes ==

There are three basic types of shapechangers in Mythic Europe, and they have different responses to magic due to their natures.

The use of a spell or invested item to change shape (including those with the Skinchanger Virtue) does not change the basic underlying fact that the target is human. While he may be affected by Animal spells, he may also be affected by Corpus and Mentem spells, and any ongoing magics using these Forms cast prior to transformation remain in effect. The transformation magic is bound by a duration, during which time the spell or effect may be detected with Intellego Vim spells. The Penetration Total of the caster must exceed the Magic Resistance of anyone that the shapechanged human wishes to touch (or attack). Furthermore, remaining in this form may incur Warping.

Those who have an innate supernatural power to change shape (represented by Virtues or Flaws such as Shapeshifter and Lycanthrope) only invoke a magical effect at the moment of transformation. Thus the shapechange is not an active effect all the time that character is in animal

form. Consequentially, Penetration is not required for mundane attacks, nor does the creature radiate magic or suffer warping due to the transformation. However, this type of shapechanger is still a human in an animal shape, and so Corpus and Mentem magics are effective, as are Animal spells. An exception is the lycanthrope, who does not retain his human mind when transformed, and therefore cannot be affected by Mentem spells, although Corpus spells still work.

The Heartbeast is the most total transformation of the three; unlike the other two, the Bjornaer magus does not merely take the physical characteristics (the 'accidents') of an animal shape; he actually becomes the animal in question. Despite retaining his human intelligence, he cannot be affected by Mentem or Corpus magics while in heartbeast form. Spells already in effect before the transformation remain in effect, however. Similarly, Animal spells cast on the heartbeast remain in effect after transformation to human form. As with shapeshifters, there is no ongoing magic beyond the moment of transformation.

<span id="secret-name-minor-house-mystery"></span>
== Secret Name (Minor House Mystery) ==

This mystery permanently severs the sympathetic resonances of the magus's name, and forges them anew with a name known only to the Mystagogue and the Initiate. All Arcane Connections to the magus which date from before the ritual immediately expire upon its completion, and all Sympathetic Connections become invalid. The magus produces new Arcane Connections after the ritual has taken place, but no Sympathetic Connection will ever work against him again, even if created after the ritual. The Mystagogue provides a secret name which allows the magus to work magic upon himself; without this he would not be able to use the Personal Range. However, anyone knowing the secret name — such as the Mystagogue, or wizards who know the mystery of Synthemata Magic (see The Mysteries Revised Edition) — need not subtract the spell level from the Penetration total of any spells cast against the target, much like the Weak Magic Resistance Flaw. Clan Ilfetu considers these secret names to be a sacred trust, and has never been suspected of misusing them.

The Initiate chooses a new public name as well as receiving the secret one. There is inevitably a time of confusion while sodales get used to referring to the magus by his new public name, but this is part of the symbolic sacrifice of this Mystery. This Mystery can benefit any person (Gifted or not) who possesses Magic Resistance, and those few magi outside the House who learn of it occasionally ask the House to perform it on their behalf.

The Initiation of this Mystery fails if the magus has a Talisman or a Familiar; these enchantments form too great a tie to the magus's past identity to be broken by the Initiation process.

<span id="oriamon--the-unigma"></span>
== Oriamon — The Unigma ==

No-one outside House Criamon really understands what their mystery is about. All Criamon magi have a score of one in the Ability Enigmatic Wisdom, and may place experience points in it at character creation. This Ability assists with the comprehension of Wizard's Twilight, but it also makes the experience more likely (see page 228). Characters may not learn Enigmatic Wisdom without being initiated into the mystery of the Enigma.

The mysteries of House Criamon are divided into several Paths. The earliest step on the Path of the Body is described here, and the rest of the major Paths are described in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults.

<span id="enigmatic-wisdom"></span>
== Enigmatic Wisdom ==

A far-reaching perception of strange and baffling phenomena that helps you understand their nature, though you may seem strange or even ludicrous to the uninitiated. Your score in this Ability is added to rolls to interpret dreams and riddles, and to understand phantasms and arcane or mysterious situations. Thanks to this Ability, Criamon magi go into Wizard's Twilight (see page 228) more often, but survive it better than most.

Specialties: interpreting signs, explaining the Enigma, Twilight.

<span id="the-path-of-the-body"></span>
== The Path of the Body ==

The Path of the Body focuses on the human form. Some Criamon magi believe that the human body and the universe reflect each other structurally, so that knowing the body illuminates the prison of time. Others enhance the body, as a tool, and as a vehicle for escape from the universe. The Criamon Path of the Body is in many ways the inverse of Hermetic alchemy, which assumes the universe is perfect and a magus who reflects it perfectly will become immortal. Criamon magi assume that the universe, like each body, is inevitably decaying.

An unusually large proportion of the Primi of the House followed this Path. The followers of the Path of the Body tend toward practical, useful insights. Primi who have achieved the Microcosmic Station on this path are active administrators under whom the House coordinates its ventures effectively.

<span id="the-avenue-of-subduing-the-meat-and-the-station-of-the-perfect-tool"></span>
== The Avenue of Subduing the Meat and the Station of the Perfect Tool ==

Several ritual investitures assist magi to find the first Station of the Body, each descended from a different tradition of mystics adopted into the early House. Those following this Avenue develop control over their body's desires and distractions, usually through painful mortifications, or fatiguing exertions, that last a year. A handful of magi have followed this avenue by being transformed into plants for a year. The Avenue ends with a guide acting as midwife for a symbolic rebirth.

At the first Station of the Path of the Body, the magus realizes that the body is the perfect tool for Hermetic magic, because it is adapted for magic, and magic, in turn, is adapted for it. The magus's close inspection of the body allows the development of Minor Potency in an aspect of the Art of Corpus. Magi who have found this Station see the intrinsic links between the body and the magical energies it wields, and so can use their understanding of magical events to minister

to the body. They may use their Enigmatic Wisdom score in place of Chirurgy and Medicine in rolls. They also know, instinctively, if their body is ill, and where, although they may not know the appropriate treatment.

Initiates of this station are bound by the lifestyle of the House (Vow) and find it more difficult to use their magic when their body is ill (Deleterious Circumstances). Some illnesses do not block certain mystical effects: the usual example given is that fevers do not restrict Ignem spells, because they are caused by a surplus of fiery humors. Wounds do not prevent magic use, of themselves, but open the body to infections, which may.

<span id="merinita--faerie-magic"></span>
== Merinita — Faerie Magic ==

A character may not be Initiated into this mystery unless she has been touched by the fay.

A character is touched by the fay if the powers of faerie have interfered with her life in a substantial fashion. Anyone with a Virtue or Flaw related to the fay qualifies, as does anyone who has gained a Warping Point from a faerie source. Merinita characters without a faerie Virtue or Flaw start with one Warping Point, caused by their parens to qualify them for the mystery.

Characters initiated into Faerie Magic are attuned to both Magical and Faerie auras, and so gain Warping Points from neither. Further, they gain full benefit from both kinds of aura, and do not gain additional botch dice from either. Magic cast by these magi counts as a fay power, so anyone who gains a Warping Point from one of their spells can be initiated into the Mystery.

Initiates of the Outer Mystery gain access to special Ranges, Durations, and Targets. They may use these with Spontaneous, Ritual, and Formulaic magic, although some of them require Ritual magic. Spells created using these parameters can only be learned by characters with Faerie Magic.

Road (Range): The maga may target anyone or anything on the same road or path as her. The identity of roads and paths is not always clear, and the troupe must decide if things are difficult. Two paths may cross each other, but two paths may not become one. In that case, either one path joins the second, or the junction is actually the joining of three paths. The maga need not be able to see her target, but she must be able to sense it somehow, unless the spell is an Intellego effect intended to find out if something is there.

People are only on a road if they are actually between the edges of the path, at least partially. Buildings are on a road if the primary access to the building is from that road. Plants and small objects must be between the edges of the path.

For the purposes of spell level calculation, Road is the same level of range as Voice.

Bargain (Duration): A spell with Bargain duration can only be cast on someone who has just concluded a bargain or agreement with the maga. The maga's Penetration total is doubled, and if the spell Penetrates the target's Magic Resistance, nothing happens unless the target breaks the bargain. If he does, the spell takes effect without the need to bypass Magic Resistance again. Bargain spells have a second duration which determines how long the spell lasts after it takes effect. To calculate the level of a Bargain spell, calculate the level of the spell that

takes effect when the bargain is broken, and add three magnitudes. The spell can only enforce a bargain for a maximum of a Year.

Fire (Duration): Spells with this duration can only be cast on fires, and they last until the fire targeted goes out. Because the fire is the target, the form of the spell must be Ignem or Imaginem. It is possible that the spell could persist indefinitely if the fire is carefully maintained. Fire is the same level of duration as Moon.

Until (Condition) (Duration): The spell lasts until some condition is met, such as speaking the name of God, or some item is touched with iron, or until a word in a list is said out of place (the days of the week are spoken out of order, for example). Until (Condition) is the same level of duration as Year, and also requires a Ritual spell. Until (Condition) spells cannot normally be dispelled by magic unless that is part of the condition. The ending condition must be specified when the spell is cast. Spells with this duration expire if the caster passes into Twilight, even temporarily, and also expire when the caster or primary target dies.

Year + 1 (Duration): The spell lasts for a year and a day. This is the same level of duration as Year, and also requires a ritual, but the duration is determined by the actual time that passes, rather than by the turning of the seasons; the spell ends at the same time of day as when it was cast, a year

and a day later. Year + 1 spells can be dispelled according to the normal rules.

Bloodline (Target): A bloodline is all the people descended by blood from a given person, the immediate target. Only the immediate target need be within the spell's range, but all members of the bloodline are affected immediately. Spouses do not count as part of the bloodline. The spell applies to all members of the bloodline born during its duration, as well as those already living when it is cast. As with all spells that target multiple people, every individual gets Magic Resistance, if applicable. The category is the same level as Structure. It is possible to design a spell with Bloodline target so that it does not warp any members of a particular bloodline (see Warping, page 389).

<span id="faerie-magic-1"></span>
== Faerie Magic ==

Faerie Magic is an Arcane Ability learned after Merinitae Initiate the Outer Mystery of Faerie Magic, which represents how their magic differs from normal Hermetic magic. This includes applying faerie thinking to arcane activities, usually by drawing out sympathetic connections between magical and mundane things.

These mystic relationships may be integrated into casting tools that Merinitae often use with their spells, called '''charms''' (see sidebar). These are symbolic representations designed to highlight a particular quality of the target that always involve some sort of artistic ability. They may be used to increase Penetration, but are also used with many of the Inner Mysteries to produce other interesting effects.

Merinitae can integrate the principles of charms into their laboratory activities, making use of their knowledge of symbols associated with the Faerie and Magic realms in their work, and this is represented by three additional effects of the Faerie Magic Ability:

* Faerie Magic may be substituted for Magic Theory when experimenting, when using faerie vis, or when practicing magic associated with the Faerie realm.
* The amount of vis you can use in a single season is equal to your (Magic Theory + Faerie Magic) x 2, so long as all of it is faerie vis.
* Add your score in Faerie Magic to the number of botch dice you roll when taking advantage of the two benefits given above, but the effects of these additional dice tend to be more annoying than dangerous, it takes two of these botches to produce the negative effects of a normal botch die. The character still gains a Warping Point for each 0 rolled on these extra dice, though they do not force you to check for Twilight. (This is because integrating faerie power into magic warps the character more quickly, but does not increase her chances of being overcome by it.)

Two or more botches on the standard botch dice require a check for Twilight as normal, however.

Faerie Magic might also represent the union of Faerie Lore and Magic Lore, the knowledge of similarities between the two realms. Often this combination can inspire surprising insights, especially when dealing with entities traditionally associated with both realms, like pagan gods, ghosts, and chimerae. It is also an appropriate Ability to use when trying to distinguish between Magic and Faerie, as it can address differences between the two realms.

Specialties: faerie vis, experimenting, inventing spells, charms, lore (Arcane)

<span id="charms"></span>
== Charms ==

Charms are casting aids that identify a specific magical effect using sympathetic magic, which all magi who study Faerie Magic learn how to make. They can be physical objects, like sculptures or drawings, or performances, like songs or stories; or even arcane pronouncements or ceremonies, like prophecy or naming.

A temporary charm takes about ten minutes to design, and must be used right away, typically with Spontaneous magic. More lasting charms, or permanent charms, take several hours, and must involve a special object that the maga wields when she activates the charm, incorporating the object into the effect; if this object is damaged, the charm must be remade.

A maga who has a score in Faerie Magic and an Arcane Connection to her target may use a charm as a sympathetic representation, increasing her Penetration Multiplier by two. This requires a roll when the charm is made: composing a song might use Communication + Music, while a drawing might be Dexterity + Craft. The maga produces an effective charm on a roll of 6+, or 9+ for a permanent charm. Other magi can do this without Faerie Magic, but it takes them longer and they need a higher total on the roll (see Sympathetic Connections, page 220).

Temporary charms may only be used once, as they always include unique properties associated with the effect, though a permanent charm associated with a special object may be used whenever it is applicable. A maga may prepare any number of charms in advance, but may only incorporate one charm into a given spell in this way.

<span id="illusion-musteries"></span>
== Illusion Musteries ==

These Mysteries deal with illusions and images, including aspects of the physical world that faeries can see but most humans cannot. These include unusual durations for Faerie Magic spells that can last nearly forever.

<span id="mystery-cult-the-pollowers-of-pendule"></span>
=== Mystery Cult: The Pollowers of Pendule ===

Pendule is regarded as something of a legend within the Order, no one knows how much of his tale is true and how much is fanciful. According to the stories, the Provençal wizard was discovered by Flambeau and refused when given the choice to &quot;join or die.&quot; He was powerful enough to evade the fiery Founder and his followers who sought to destroy him, and many comedic tales depicting Pendule as a trickster defeating the mighty and blustery Flambeau with wit and illusions have become part of Hermetic lore.

Eventually, it seems, Pendule tired of these games and adopted four Hermetic magi as his followers. No one knows exactly why he did this; perhaps he simply wanted to share his secrets with others before he died, or perhaps he desired to learn Magic Theory from them. Two of these followers were from House Merinita, and having Initiated Faerie Magic from Quendalon they were able to master the illusion Mysteries Pendule taught — the others could not comprehend them. Afterwards, these Merinitae continued to teach the secrets to their followers as part of a special House lineage.

Pendule's magic was very sensual and personal, and he especially believed in the use of color and sound in his spells. He expected magic to transform the wielder, rather than yield submissively to him, and while he was oddly sensitive to the passage of time, he seemed to have great difficulty with standard Hermetic durations, preferring spells that relied upon strange conditions or that triggered after being cast. He also practiced other Mysteries which his Merinita followers did not master, and other lineages dedicated to his magic still exist in other Houses and cults within (and perhaps without) the Order.

Followers of Pendule usually Initiate Spell Timing and Glamour (described in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) from their masters. Imaginem is almost always their primary Art. A common weakness in the lineage is iron — both of the Merinitae who studied Pendule's secrets were especially susceptible to it — and Pendule Merinitae often learn Spell Improvisation or a Major Magical Focus in counterspells.

Pendule quietly succumbed to death in 854 AD, but not before imparting one last magical secret to each of his followers. To maintain this tradition, the Inner Mystery of Perpetuity is usually kept from a maga until her master is dying, Initiated as a final lesson from teacher to student.

Sample Followers of Pendule Initiation: Spell Timing

Ease Factor: 15

(Minor Virtue known to the Mystagogue)

Script Bonus: +12

Script Details: The Initiate undergoes a ceremony wherein she must go an entire day and night without sleeping, casting a non-Fatiguing Imaginem spell every round to count how many individual moments pass (+3). After this rite she gains three Minor Flaws to represent how her magic becomes more illusionary, and her way of thinking about time becomes more rigid: Harmless Magic (+3), Poor Memory (faces) (+3), and a Social Handicap (+3). Because of this ordeal, the Initiate is said to begin to more closely resemble Pendule, and many of his followers adopt wild, multicolored clothing, dye their hair, or radically alter their physical appearance soon after their Initiation.

<span id="spell-timing-minor-illusion-mustery"></span>
== Spell Timing (Minor Illusion Mustery) ==

This Mystery gives a maga access to several new Durations for her spells. Only those who have Initiated this Mystery may cast or invent spells and effects that use them.

Three of these new durations allow the maga to cast the spell but keep it dormant, &quot;holding&quot; it for a specified length of time. The effect and its Penetration are evaluated when it is released, as if she had just cast the spell. If the parameters are no longer applicable (the target has moved out of range, for example, or dramatically changed size), the spell has no effect.

Held (Duration): This duration is the same level as Concentration. The maga may cast the spell as normal, but the effect is delayed for as long as she concentrates. When she releases it, treat it as if cast with Momentary duration.

Midday/Midnight (Duration): This duration is equivalent to Sun, but does not manifest until dawn, dusk, noon, or midnight. It then lasts until the next dawn, dusk, noon, or midnight. For example, a spell cast just after dawn would not manifest until noon, and would then last until dusk.

Season (Duration): This duration is held until the start of the next equinox or solstice, and lasts only until the following equinox or solstice. It is the same level as Moon, but requires a ritual spell like Year.

Three other durations have conditions that must be built into the spell when it is designed, similar to the Until (Condition) Duration.

While (Condition) (Duration): The target must perform some activity, such as a musical

performance or reading a book, or fulfill some common and temporary physical condition, such as sleeping or being drunk. As long as that condition lasts, the spell remains in effect. This is the same level as Concentration.

Not (Condition) (Duration): The spell lasts for as long as the target does not fulfill some common physical condition, such as sleeping or speaking. It is equivalent in level to Sun duration, but cannot last longer than a month.

If (Condition) (Duration): This effect triggers if the target fulfills a specific condition. It has an additional Duration which determines how long the triggered spell lasts after it takes effect. To determine the level, you should add four magnitudes to the level calculated based on the Duration that the spell has when it takes effect, and it must be cast as a ritual spell. The spell expires without triggering if the caster passes into Twilight, even temporarily, if the caster dies, or if a year passes.

In addition, this Mystery allows the Merinita's spells to have recurring effects—she designs the spell so that from then on it always triggers in response to an environmental or physical condition, increasing its level as described on the chart in the insert. The recurring spell must be cast as a ritual, and effects that require a ritual because of their unusual effects or non-Hermetic origins (not because of their level or spell parameters) cannot recur. For example, a ritual with Year duration can be made to recur, but a lasting effect like Chirurgeon's Healing Touch (CrCo20) or a unique effect like Breath of the Open Sky (ReAu40) cannot.

Recurring spells may be given triggers, using the special (Condition) durations above. The cost for making them recur is based on how often they

<span id="recurring-spells"></span>
== Recurring Spells ==

Use the frequency that most closely matches how often the spell recurs, rounding up to the next greater magnitude. For example, a spell that recurs every ten minutes adds five magnitudes. Spells cannot recur more often than once per minute.

can be activated; if a daily-recurring effect is activated twice in one day, the second trigger will have no effect. Also, spells cannot stack; when a spell recurs, it cancels before starting again. This is not a noticeable interruption; as with an enchanted device, the transition usually appears constant.

<span id="verditius--verditius-magic"></span>
== Verditius — Verditius Magic ==

Verditius magi are initiated into the Outer Mystery of Verditius Magic, which allows them to incorporate craft Abilities into their magic. To do this, the magus crafts the item from raw materials as part of the first season of enchanting it. For a talisman or standard invested device, this is the season in which it is opened for enchantment. For lesser enchanted items and charged items, this is the whole process. If crafting the item would normally take the magus a season or less, this does not increase the time required for the enchantment. If crafting the item would normally take more than a season, the process takes a whole number of seasons that is at least as long as the time it would normally take the magus to craft the item. For example, if it would normally take the magus four months to craft the item, then it takes him two seasons to craft and enchant it. No matter how long this takes, it only includes the first season of enchantment.

As part of this process, the magus may add details that enhance the Shape and Material bonus of the item. These details give an additional bonus to all the item's existing Shape and Material bonuses equal to the creating magus's Philosophiae score, for the purposes of enchantment. These bonuses apply in the season that the details are added, as well as in the future. Other uses of Shape and Material bonuses, such as the casting bonuses from a talisman, use the standard bonus. Other magi refer to these

details as Verditius Runes, but they are far more complex than that suggests, and do not normally look like actual runes. Other magi get this bonus if they instill appropriate powers into an item created by a Verditius. The total bonus from Shape and Material and Verditius Runes is still limited by the magus's Magic Theory score.

The magus uses the magic of the enchantment to shape the item. This does not require any Craft Ability, although most Verditius magi will use an Ability that they have, and the final form may be impossible to make by mundane means. For example, a Verditius magus could set a gem into a wooden lattice in such a way that it cannot be removed without breaking the wood — even though the lattice shows no signs of having been broken to insert the gem. The final form must be able to sustain itself by mundane means once created, in particular, it must be strong enough to bear its own weight. If the magus is not using Craft Ability and an Ability score is needed, use the magus's Finesse in place of Craft.

However, most Verditius do use mundane craft as part of this process. This is because a magus who does so may add his score in the relevant Craft Ability to all Lab Totals for enchanting that item, both in the first season and in the future. Thanks to his mystical link to the item, this bonus is always his current Craft Ability, even if it has improved since he crafted the item. Note that only one Craft Ability can be added to the Lab Total in a given season, even if the magus has more than one applicable to the item. The applicable Ability may, however, change over time — the magus should add his highest applicable Craft Ability. Other magi adding enchantments to an invested device do not get this bonus, even if they have the same Craft Ability as the creating magus, and even if they are members of House Verditius.

If the magus creates the enchanted item in this way, the number of pawns of vis needed to open the item for enchantment is reduced by the magus's Craft score, to a minimum of one pawn. The magus, or any other magus, may invest effects in the device as if he had paid the full, normal cost to open it.

A Verditius naturally reinforces Verditius Runes as part of the enchantment process, even when working on an item that has already been enchanted, and so if a Verditius working on an enchanted item has a higher Philosophiae score than the earlier Verditius enchanters, the Verditius Rune bonus increases. This also applies if a Verditius magus increases his Philosophiae score between seasons of enchantment.

Verditius magi need casting tools to cast Formulaic or Ritual spells. They make these themselves, in a form that appeals to them, and it only takes an hour or so to make a new one. However, if they lose or cannot reach their tools, they cannot cast their Formulaic spells. Spontaneous spells do not require casting tools, although Flaws hampering Spontaneous magic are very common among the Verditius.

<span id="dubris"></span>
=== Dubris ===

A magus's first Initiation into an Inner Mystery of House Verditius is always accompanied by an Ordeal that gives him the minor Flaw: Hubris. Every Verditius magus who seeks knowledge of the Inner Mysteries is plagued by this psychological shortcoming, the growth of exaggerated self-esteem. The magus realizes the worldly benefits he can reap from his magical creations, and his prideful image of himself blossoms. At first this is just a slight personality shift, but as the Verditius magus profits from his magical craft, his hubris grows. This trait, which beleaguered the founder, is inherent in the magic of the Inner Mysteries. In game terms, characters receive the Minor Personality Flaw: Hubris and the corresponding Personality Trait: Hubris 1.

Hubris is more than merely a Personality Trait. While it contains all the game aspects of a Personality Trait, it is also a measure of the degree that a character has succumbed to the curse of pride that plagued the founder. A propensity for pride is part and parcel of the Mysteries of House Verditius. The intrinsic magical link between Verditius' hubris and his arcane crafting, carries through to his descendants. A Verditius magus's pride is mystically coupled with his Gift, and as his Hubris increases so does his ability to instill greater amounts of magic in items that are similarly connected to him. A Verditius magus can add his Hubris score to his Lab Totals for creating a talisman, enchanting casting tools (Minor House Inner Mystery), binding magical animals, making automata, and creating attuned items (Major House Inner Mysteries).

For role-playing purposes, the specific flavor of a magus' Hubris should be noted in parentheses after the Personality score. Hubris does not manifest in all magi exactly the same way. Some are overly proud, some arrogant, some pompous. Characters that already have the Minor Personality Flaw: Proud have their Hubris score automatically increased by +1, and those with the Major version of the Flaw increase their Hubris by +3.

Hubris increases over time, building like an Ability. Hubris cannot be deliberately changed by the player, unlike other Personality Traits. Specific situations grant Experience Points that are applied to a character's Hubris score. If a Verditius magus receives recognition, fame, money, or vis for his magical efforts, his Hubris score increases. While a degree of pride is inevitable for every Verditius magus, a completely conceited nature is avoidable. Those wishing to keep their Hubris score low need merely avoid many of the behaviors that result in increasing that score.

The higher a magus's Hubris score grows, the harder it is for him to resist situations that will further increase it. A magus with Hubris 4 will be quite tempted to continue to sell magical items, for example. If a character wishes to resist such temptations, in hopes of maintaining a low Hubris score, you can make opposed Personality Trait rolls. This assumes the character has a Personality Trait that she can uses against her Hubris score. She can also spend a Confidence Point to walk away from the situation.

Magi with Hubris scores of 6 and higher are extremely self-centered. These are the magi most prone to engage in vendettas with other Verditius magi, usually with those as self-centered as themselves. Resisting a declared vendetta is difficult. If the maga wishes to resist, you must make an opposed Personality Trait + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of your maga's Hubris score + her challenger's Hubris score. You may

substitute her Intelligence if she does not have a Personality Trait that works opposite Hubris.

Demons and other Infernal agents are quite aware that Verditius magi are susceptible to the great sin of pride, and many lick their chops in anticipation as a maga advances through the Inner Mysteries. Some will offer seemingly innocuous assistance to young magi to propel them on their hubristic path: anonymous gifts of vis, coincidental deliveries of Verditius Cult Lore texts to copy, and accidental meetings with wealthy clients willing to pay large amounts for minor magical gewgaws.

<span id="anchant-casting-tools--minor-house-mystery-virtue"></span>
== Anchant Casting Tools — Minor House Mystery Virtue ==

Soon after Fenistour invented casting tools, allowing Verditius magi to cast Formulaic spells, her filii sought to develop a method of enchanting them, hoping to further compensate their brethren for their clumsiness at spell casting. Achieving their goal in the ninth century, Verditius magi began sharing these secrets, developing Scripts so that their fellows could be more easily Initiated into this Mystery. This is particularly useful for those adventurous Verditius magi who like casting spells outside of their laboratory. This is a very common Inner House Mystery among Verditius magi in the thirteenth century.

The magus may enchant his casting tools to mirror certain effects of mastered spells, as well as allowing casting bonuses when he uses them. This is a laboratory process, requiring a season spent working in a Hermetic laboratory. Each casting tool can only be enchanted once, even if it has more than one property, and the magus must be able to finish the enchantment in a single season as if he were creating a lesser enchanted device. Enchanted casting tools cannot be instilled with other magical powers, and cannot be used as a base for a lesser or greater enchanted item.

To enchant a casting tool compare the magus's Technique and Form Lab Total to the level of the spell that the casting tool is associated with. A casting tool is closely linked to the spell through the Verditius Mysteries, and so the magus may carve Verditius runes into the casting tool, adding his Philosophiae score to the Lab Total, even if the tool would not normally have a Shape or Material bonus for that spell. If the magus has a Craft Ability that could include making the tools, you may also add his Craft score. Because enchanted casting tools become permanent Arcane Connections to the magus, add his Hubris Personality score to the Lab Total. The magus also receives a bonus for knowing the spell in the first place, adding the magnitude of the spell to the Lab Total, much like the bonus received from knowing a similar spell (page 260). The Lab Total must double the level of the spell plus any additional powers the magus wishes to instill.

Enchant Casting Tools Lab Total: Technique + Form + Intelligence

* Magic Theory + Aura Modifier + Philosophiae
* Hubris + Magnitude of Known Spell
* Craft (if applicable)

The base effect level of the casting tool equals the level of the spell it is used for. The effect level increases based upon the additional effects the magus wishes to enchant it with. There is no limit to the number of effects he can add, as long as his Lab Total plus bonuses is double the final effect level.

INITIATION OF ENCHANT CASTING TOOLS

Ease Factor: 15 (Minor Virtue known to the Mystagogue)

Script Bonus: +9

Script Details: The Mystagogue spends a season with the Initiate, creating casting tools one after another (+3). The Initiate must know the exact time and date that she was Initiated into the House's Outer Mystery. On an anniversary of that date, she ritualistically buries all her casting tools in a Magic regio (+3). If the Initiation is successful, the Initiate learns the Inner House Minor Mystery: Enchant Casting Tools. The buried casting tools are destroyed and the Initiate receives the Minor Flaw Hubris if this her first Initiation into an Inner Mystery, or Limited Magic Resistance with Vim if it is not (Ordeal +3).

<span id="ex-miscellanea-traditions"></span>
= Ex Miscellanea Traditions =

ouse Ex Miscellanea is not at all unified, consisting of many different magical traditions. A large number are described in Houses of Hermes: Societates,

including the Columbae, who brought the techniques of warding into Hermetic magic, and the Cult of Orpheus, which may be the heir to an ancient Greek mystery cult. This section provides details of three relatively simple traditions that you may choose for your maga, or you may create your own following the guidelines in the Characters chapter.

<span id="beast-masters"></span>
== Beast Masters ==

This tradition commands magic which Hermetic Theory finds very hard: the summoning and control of wild creatures. Every apprentice of this tradition was abandoned by his master in areas of wilderness at a very young age, where he had to fend for himself. During this time he developed a particular affinity for a specific group of animals, which forever shapes his magic. Due to this unusual training, all Beast Masters also have the Virtues of Animal Ken and a Minor Magical Focus with a specific group of animals. They are never taught how to turn into animal form, or how to harm animals, which results in the Incompatible Arts Flaw (MuCo &amp; PeAn). They must take at least one more Flaw to balance their Virtues, and then have only 8 points of Flaws available to them to buy another 8 points of Virtues.

<span id="summon-animals-1"></span>
=== Summon Animals ===

This Ability allows the character to summon mundane animals from potentially long distances away. To use this Ability, the character must be capable of making an audible call to the creatures he wishes to summon, and must be within one day's journey of a habitat where the required species are found. The number of animals which respond to his summons is determined by the score in the character's Ability, see the table

below. He must then make a Communication + Summon Animals roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If successful, the animals arrive within 1 hour of the character making the call, although exceeding the Ease Factor by 3 makes them come in 2 minutes, and exceeding it by 6 summons them in a single round.

The character cannot directly communicate with the animals unless he has another Ability which allows him to do so (such as Animal Ken), and they depart naturally, as determined by the storyguide. Even if the character lacks the ability to communicate with the animals, they act as if friendly towards him, and if naturally aggressive, may fight to defend him.

<span id="the-nemthengacha"></span>
== The Nemthengacha ==

The Nemthengacha (singular: Nemthenga) are a sect of Ex Miscellanea magi who have the ability to create animosity and dissent in their listeners. Their origins are clouded. Some claim the Irish poet/demigod Bricriu mac Carbada is the progenitor of the line, while others say that the Welsh hero Efnisien is the first of the breed. Asserting an even more grandiose foundation, some Ex Miscellanea say that their tradition descends from Loki, the multi-faceted and often malevolent Norse god. It is true that this tradition is only found in Celtic and Scandinavian sorcerers.

Nemthengacha, also known as &quot;poisontongues&quot;, &quot;bitter-tongues&quot;, or &quot;deceivers&quot;, were more frequent before the advent of Christianity. In pre-Christian society, Nemthengacha held a devastating reputation. In a society where loyalty and family bonds are everything, a Nemthenga's ability to turn one man against his allies was devastating. People avoided Nemthengacha, but since many lived among the tribe, they could not be entirely ignored

<span id="story-seed-animal-experimentation"></span>
== Story Seed: Animal Experimentation ==

This Ability can call animals quicker than they could possibly travel under their own speed, and therefore breaks the Limit of Arcane Connection. A magus interested in pursuing breakthroughs in Magic Theory might seek out a character with this Ability.

and were placated as best as the tribe could manage. While no more anticlerical than any other Ex Miscellanea tradition, they suffered severely from interactions with Christian missionaries. Perhaps it was due to their overt presence. The unGifted Nemthengacha did not need to hide from their tribesmen, and several held prominent social positions as shamans, wise men, and king's champions. Their tradition ebbed, and practitioners retreated to remote parts of their lands.

In the thirteenth century, Gifted Nemthengacha have been systematically accepted into the Order of Hermes, although some unGifted Nemthengacha still remain, living in the far hinterlands of Mythic Europe. Though stretched, they never severed their connections to their clans, so that many are still related to members of a local tribe or kin group. Nor have they abandoned their connection to royal society, with many Nemthengacha still serving their local king.

<span id="powers"></span>
=== Powers ===

Like every Ex Miscellanea character, a magus of the Nemthengacha tradition receives a free Major non-Hermetic Virtue, a compulsory Major Flaw, and a free Minor Hermetic Virtue. The Major Non-Hermetic Virtue is Embitterment, a new Major Supernatural Ability. Embitterment is similar to Entrancement (page 164), but the effects are more specific and potent. Due to this focus, Nemthengacha find it difficult to control other emotions in a target's mind, which spills over into other aspects of Hermetic magic. Each has the Major Hermetic Flaw: Deficient Technique Rego. Since Embitterment depends solely on the Nemthenga's voice, his magic is less dependent on gestures than other Hermetic magi. He receives the Minor Hermetic Virtue: Subtle Magic, at no cost.

Major Non-Hermetic Virtue: Embitterment Minor Hermetic Virtue: Subtle Magic Major Hermetic Flaw: Deficient Technique (Rego)

<span id="embitterment-1"></span>
==== '''Embitterment''' ====

Embitterment is a Major Supernatural Ability that allows the speaker to make a listener hostile to a target of the speaker's choice. This hostility can range from simple antagonism to murder. Through simple conversation, the speaker makes the listener dislike, resent, or hate a person formerly considered a friend. The conversation does not have to be long; a round is time enough for this effect to take place.

To embitter a target, the player states the exact specifications of how the target will act against the intended victim. He then rolls the character's Communication + Embitterment + a stress die and compares it to a variable Ease Factor, which depends on the level of aggression he wishes to instill, and the level of loyalty possessed between the target and the former ally. Since this is a Supernatural Ability, the roll always uses a stress die. The Embitterment power of the Nemthengacha is a Magic power for purposes of determining its interaction with the other realms of power; it seems likely that an Infernal version also exists.

<span id="embitterment-roll-communication--embitterment--stress-die"></span>
== Embitterment Roll: Communication + Embitterment + Stress Die ==

Consult the following chart to determine the Ease Factor.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Ease<br>Factor
! Desired Effect
|-
| 6
| Turn a man against his neighbor, business partner, or co-worker
|-
| 9
| Turn a man against his wife, friend, or cousin (distant kin)
|-
| 12
| Turn a man against his kin (father, brother, and nuclear family)
|-
| 15
| Turn a man against his lord
|-
| 18
| Turn a man against his king
|}

The base effect makes the victim dislike the target, leading to slander, resentment, and a refusal to cooperate with him. Increasing this animosity to hatred adds +3 to the Ease Factor. Victims made to hate the indicated target desire to do some kind of harm to him, but stop short of killing the person. Such a person would destroy someone's fields, ruin a business opportunity, wreck their marriage, or perhaps wound them in a duel. Increasing hatred to loathing adds another +3 to the Ease Factor (+6 in total), and makes the

victim try to slay the intended target. For example, the Ease Factor is 18 to embitter a man to commit patricide (base 12 + 6), and 24 to commit regicide (base 18 + 6).

The Range of embitterment is Voice and the Target is always Individual. The Duration is Sun, although this can be increased to Moon by increasing Ease Factor by +3. Because embitterment acts through conversation, the caster must speak a language that the target comprehends.

A character so embittered cannot disobey the command. He is not allowed a Loyalty roll to see if he can ignore the emotional summons, or other quibbling based on the character's Personality Traits. Hermetic magic can cancel the embitterment with a Perdo Vim spell. Rego Mentem magic can replace the feelings of animosity with feelings of loyalty or compassion, Creo Mentem can create feelings of loyalty that supersede the effect, and Perdo Mentem could erase the feelings of animosity. To determine how powerful a Hermetic spell needs to be, consider the effective level of the embitterment to be equal to the Nemthenga's score in Embitterment times five.

<span id="tempestaria-ceather-citch"></span>
== Tempestaria (Ceather Citch) ==

This tradition figures prominently in lands occupied by the Saxons, including their homeland in northern Germany as well as in England and Denmark. Weather magic is well-integrated into Hermetic Magic, and the art of Auram is populated with highly useful spells. The hedge witches known as Tempestariae are experts in these very magics. There are weather-witches who can summon rain which can last for days, or who cause no rain to fall at all for an entire season. The fogs summoned by a tempestaria from the sea have bound ships into the harbors all along an entire coastline. The most common type of tempestaria, however, is one who can bind the wind to her service. They require simple improvised tools which have sympathetic relationships to their spells – feathers for snow magic, drums for thunder magic, scattered sand for rain magic, and so forth.

Major Non-Hermetic Virtue: Whistle Up The Wind (or similar Ability)

Minor Hermetic Virtue: Affinity with Auram Major Hermetic Flaw: Necessary Condition (tools for their magic to work)

<span id="thistle-up-the-mind"></span>
== Thistle Up The Mind ==

A character with this Ability is able to create a wind, duplicating the effects of any wind-based Creo Auram spell at Range Voice, Target Individual; similar Supernatural Abilities exist for other weather phenomena. To invoke the wind, the character literally has to whistle, and makes a Stamina + Whistle Up The Wind roll, against the Ease Factor listed in the table below. If successful, the wind immediately starts to blow as commanded by the character. It will continue to blow in the same manner even if the character stops whistling. A character who summons a wind at a particular strength can change that wind to another type with a similar strength (such as from Circling Winds of Protection to Broom of the Winds), diminish it to a weaker effect (such as Chamber of Spring Breezes), or end it entirely. Each of these changes requires a Communication + Music roll, using the Ease Factors for Maintaining Concentration on a spell (page 215). Whistling a new tune in this manner cannot increase the strength of a wind, or return a diminished wind to its former intensity; instead the character must make a new Whistle Up The Wind roll. All effects of this Ability diminish to the next lowest level of strength once every 24 hours, when the sun sets, until they dwindle to nothing.

<span id="viii-laboratory"></span>
== VIII. Laboratory ==

magus spends much more time in his laboratory engaged in study and other activities than adventuring in the lands outside the covenant. There are Arts to study, books to write, spells to invent, and items to enchant. Time between stories is recorded in seasons, each of which is enough time to accomplish a single long-term laboratory activity. Each of those activities is described in this chapter.

<span id="the-laboratory-in-play"></span>
= The Laboratory in Play =

aboratory activities take up most of your life as a magus, so you should take some care in deciding both your individual laboratory activities and your

attitude towards your laboratory and your creations. Your laboratory itself is an important reflection of your personality, as it is where you spend much of your time. Take the time to think about what your sanctum looks like and what's in it. Does it bear protective spells? Where do you sleep? What do you have in your lab, and where do you keep it? Do you hide your most prized possessions? Is your laboratory clean and well kept, or a disorganized mess where no one but you can find anything?

Answering such questions helps you define your magus, and is usually fun to boot. The rules for Laboratory personalization on page 286 explain the ways in which such descriptions can have an impact on the mechanics of laboratory activities.

<span id="basic-laboratory-activities"></span>
== Basic Laboratory Activities ==

YOUR BASIC LAB TOTAL IS:

Technique + Form + Intelligence + Magic Theory + Aura Modifier

The Lab Total for a particular Technique and Form is called the Technique Form Lab Total: for example, the Creo Vim Lab Total is Creo + Vim + Intelligence + Magic Theory + Aura Modifier. If an activity is based on a Lab Total, the magus needs a laboratory to do it, and there are also a few activities that do need a laboratory, but are not based on a Lab Total.

<span id="creating-a-laboratory"></span>
== Creating a Laboratory ==

A laboratory is normally created in a space with at least 500 square feet of floor area, and a ceiling at least ten feet high, and it is normally well protected from the elements; normal canvas is not sufficient, but a wooden wall is. (Laboratories that do not reach these standards cause problems for work in them; see page 286.) A character must have a Magic Theory score of at least 3 to set up a laboratory, and overall it takes two seasons of work.

The first season creates a basic laboratory, which makes laboratory activities possible but imposes a -3 penalty to all Lab Totals. The second season completes the process, making a standard laboratory and removing the penalty. A maga can go on to personalize her laboratory, and the process of doing so is described at the end of this chapter.

<span id="arcane-studies"></span>
== Arcane Studies ==

Knowledge of Magic Theory and the magical Arts is important to magi — so much so that many spend their entire lives in study. Magi may increase their Art scores in several different ways. Each is described in turn in the &quot;Experience and Advancement&quot; section, which begins on page 375.

<span id="fixing-arcane-connections"></span>
== Fixing Arcane Connections ==

A magus who has an active Arcane Connection (see page 219) may make it permanent by spending a season of laboratory work and one pawn of Vim vis. The connection must be active at the beginning of the season, but need not be such as to naturally last for the whole season. This activity must be performed in a laboratory, even though it is not based on a Lab Total.

<span id="vis-1"></span>
== Vis ==

Manipulation of vis is a key pursuit in any magus' laboratory.

<span id="vis-extraction"></span>
== Vis Extraction ==

You can extract raw vis from a magical environment (that is, any area with a Magical aura) by focusing the magical energy into a physical form. For each season that you spend extracting vis from the environment, calculate your Creo Vim Lab Total. For every ten points or part thereof in the result, one pawn of Vim vis is produced.

VIS EXTRACTION: One tenth (round up) of Creo Vim Lab Total pawns of Vim vis

<span id="vis-transfer"></span>
=== Vis Transfer ===

A magus can easily move raw vis from one physical form to another in his laboratory. This takes a day (from sunrise to sunrise), and can be done while the magus is engaged in another laboratory activity. It must, however, be done in a laboratory.

The maximum amount of vis that an item can contain is determined from the Material and Size Table on page 255. When moving raw vis into an item, rather than preparing it for enchantment, a magus may move any number of pawns up to the capacity of the item.

An item that has been opened for enchantment (see page 254, below) cannot contain raw vis as well.

Note that this changes the physical thing that the vis is in, not the Hermetic Art to which the vis is attuned.

<span id="vis-use"></span>
== Vis Use ==

The amount of raw vis that a magus may use in a single season is limited to twice his Magic Theory score. The magus cannot successfully integrate any more vis into a single project. In many sagas, vis will be rare enough that this limit will not come into play.

VIS LIMIT: Magic Theory x 2 pawns per season

<span id="spells"></span>
== Spells ==

ormulaic spells are a major measure of your power because they determine those things you can do easily and predictably. As a magus, you

may invent new spells in several ways.

<span id="learning-spells-from-a-teacher"></span>
== Learning Spells from a Teacher ==

You may learn spells from another magus who is willing to spend a season teaching you. These spells may be of different Techniques and Forms, so a magus could teach you a Creo Ignem spell and a Perdo Terram spell in the same season.

The number of levels of spells you may learn in one season is equal to the teacher's highest applicable Lab Total. If the teaching magus had a Creo Ignem Lab Total of 50 and a Perdo Terram Lab Total of 35, he could teach you a total of 50 levels of spells. The number of levels of spells of a given Technique and Form combination that you may learn in a given season is equal to the teacher's Lab Total in that combination.

The highest individual spell level you may learn is equal to your Lab Total in the Technique and Form of the spell. Thus, if you had a Creo Ignem Lab Total of 30 and a Perdo Terram Lab Total of 25, and were learning from the teacher described above, you could learn a CrIg 25 spell and a PeTe 25 spell, or CrIg 20, CrIg 10, PeTe 15 and PeTe 5, or any other combination adding up to fifty total levels (the teacher's Lab Total in Creo Ignem), as long as there were no more than 35 levels of Perdo Terram spells (the teacher's Lab Total in Perdo Terram), with no Creo Ignem spell over level 30 and no Perdo Terram spell over level 25 (your Lab Totals in the relevant Technique and Form combinations).

Even when you learn a spell from a teacher, it is your Wizard's Sigil that manifests in your version; you actually invent the spell yourself, but with constant guidance from the teacher.

MAXIMUM TOTAL LEVELS: Teacher's highest applicable Lab Total

MAXIMUM LEVELS IN ONE TECHNIQUE AND FORM: Teacher's Lab Total in that Technique and Form

HIGHEST LEVEL OF AN INDIVIDUAL SPELL: Student's Lab Total in the Technique and Form of the Spell

<span id="inventing-spells"></span>
== Inventing Spells ==

Inventing a spell by yourself is more difficult than learning one, but of course you don't need a teacher to do it. First, decide the effects of the spell you wish to invent, you may pick a spell described in the Spells chapter to invent, invent a variant of a spell listed there, or make up something completely on your own.

If you want to duplicate an existing spell, use the statistics given for it in the Spells chapter, but include your wizard's sigil (see &quot;Sigils&quot; on page 224)

If you create a variant of a spell in the Spells chapter (change its Range, say, or allow it to affect a different kind of Target), first refer to the spell that you are basing your spell on. Then determine whether you are changing the spell's Range, Duration, Target, or a combination of those. The new spell's level is determined based on how radically the new spell is different from the old one. The method for determining the new spell's level is described under &quot;Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets&quot; on page 303.

When you invent a completely new spell you must describe it fully, both in terms of its mechanics (Range, Duration, and Target) and how it fits into the medieval paradigm. You must make sure that it takes into account the limits of magic (see page 210). To determine the new spell's level, you must first determine its Technique and Form. This should be a matter of common sense. Next, refer to the general guidelines for that Technique/Form combination, found in the Spells chapter. This will provide a list of what sorts of effects correspond to each spell level. Determine the final level of the spell by referring to the guidelines &quot;Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets&quot; on page 303.

Once you have determined the specifics of the spell you are trying to invent, you must determine if you can actually invent it. Then, you must figure out how long it will take. You can only invent a spell if your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level. You get a bonus for knowing a similar spell (+1 per five levels of the highest level similar spell — see &quot;Similar Spells&quot; on page 260). Any requisites that the new spell has also count in calculating your Lab Total. For each point that your Lab Total exceeds the spell's level, you accumulate one point per season. When you accumulate points equal to the level of the spell, you invent it.

It is also possible to invent a spell based on another magus's Laboratory Text (see page 262). This is much faster, and most spells that magi know are invented in this way.

<span id="example-inventing-spells"></span>
== Example: Inventing Spells ==

Tillitus of House Bonisagus wants to invent some warding spells, as minor mystical creatures seem to give him a lot of trouble. General wards of this sort are Rego Vim (see page 370), and can be invented at any level. Semita Errabunda, Tillitus's covenant, has a Magic aura of 5, and Tillitus himself has Intelligence +5, Magic Theory 3, +2 for Puissant Magic Theory, his free Bonisagus Virtue, Rego 5, and Vim 5. Thus, his Rego Vim Lab Total is 25.

Consulting the Spells chapter, Matt, Tillitus's player, sees that a separate spell must be invented for each of the four Realms. He decides to start by inventing a good ward against magical creatures. He picks level 20, as this is less than his Lab Total.

Tillitus's Lab Total of 25 exceeds the spell level, 20, by 5, so every season Tillitus gains 5 points towards the spell. Since the spell is level 20, that means it will take him four seasons, a whole year, to invent the spell. Matt isn't sure that he wants to spend that much time on it, so he looks at a lower level spell.

If Tillitus tries to invent a level 12 spell, he gets 13 points towards it every season, and thus can invent it in a single season. If he tries to invent a level 13 spell, he gets 12 points per season, so it would take him two seasons. Matt thus decides that Tillitus will invent a level 12 ward against magical creatures.

<span id="enchantments"></span>
== '''Enchantments''' ==

hysical creations, as surely as magical knowledge, can increase your power as a magus. In addition to talismans, which you can use to

concentrate your magical powers, you can create invested devices, which mimic the powers of spells; lesser enchanted devices, simpler versions of invested devices; charged items, which can be used a limited number of times; and longevity rituals, which extend your mortal life. Since magical enchantments are unique creations that follow the logic of individual magi, determining how to use one that someone else has created can be a lengthy and even dangerous process.

Magical enchantments are created through a type of ritual magic, and therefore require a great deal of time, effort, and magical resources. You must take the time to prepare your laboratory for the task, gather all the necessary materials and equipment, and then craft your work in earnest, exercising great care with the details of the enchantment. In the end, you have an item that is independent and that generates its own magical energies in order to function, but that is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. Your magical sigil figures just as prominently in the effects produced by your magical enchantments as it does in the effects produced by your spells.

Raw vis is often required to create magical enchantments. The process of enchanting an item transforms the vis, linking the magic power inexorably to the item in which it is instilled. Vis used for enchantments is thus transformed so that it is no longer usable for any other purposes, and it can never be extracted from the enchantment it is used to create. Magi sometimes refer to the magic of enchantments as &quot;spun,&quot; rather than &quot;raw.&quot; vis.

Effects matching those of Ritual spells may not be placed in any enchantment. The elaborate rituals needed to control that much magical power simply cannot be contained in an unthinking physical item. The exception is that spells that are Rituals only because the spell level is over 50, not because of Duration, Target, or major effect, may be placed in items.

<span id="enchantment-summary"></span>

==== 3. INVEST EFFECT. ====

Invested Items and Lesser Enchantments: For every point by which your Lab Total exceeds the level of the effect, you gain one point towards the effect per season.

Uses a number of pawns of vis matching the Technique or Form of the effect equal to the level divided by ten (rounded up). Again, a magus cannot use more than 2 x Magic Theory pawns of vis in a single season.

Charged ITEMS: For every five points or fraction by which your Lab Total exceeds the level of the effect, you get one charge.

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Invest Further effects (Invested Items only). You can use a number of pawns of vis equal to the number of pawns spent opening the item to invest effects. Once the number of pawns used to invest effects equals the number of pawns used to open the item, the item is full, and no further effects can be added.</li></ol>

<span id="types-of-enchanted-item"></span>
== Types of Enchanted Item ==

Enchanted devices come in three types: invested items, lesser enchantments, and charged items.

<span id="innested-items"></span>
==== Innested Items ====

Invested items must be prepared for enchantment before any powers are instilled, but multiple effects can be instilled in one item. A magus may spend several seasons instilling one effect, and need not instill all desired effects in the item at once.

The total number of pawns of vis expended when instilling effects may not exceed the number of pawns of vis spent to prepare the item for enchantment. Once the two numbers match, the invested device is 'full'. It is not possible to remove an effect from a device to make room for a better one.

<span id="lesser-enchantments"></span>
==== Lesser Enchantments ====

Lesser enchantments do not need to be prepared before a power is instilled, but only one power may be instilled. In addition, the creating magus must be able to instill the power in a single season; his Lab Total must be at least twice the adjusted level of the effect.

Investing an effect in a lesser enchantment costs one pawn of appropriate vis for every ten levels or fraction of the effect, just as for an invested item, but there is no need to spend any Vim vis to prepare the item. The total amount of vis needed is just the one pawn per ten levels or part required to instill the effect. The amount of vis that a magus can expend on a lesser enchantment is limited by the material and size of the object being enchanted (see page 255), just as for an invested device.

A lesser enchantment can never receive any further magical powers; once the magus has spent a single season on it, the work is complete.

<span id="charged-items"></span>
=== Charged Items ===

Charged items do not cost vis, but can only be used a limited number of times. It takes a single season to create charged items.

Design the level of effect for the charged item using the normal rules for enchanted items, with the exception that you do not have to pick a number of uses per day. A charged item can be used as desired until the charges run out.

Once you have chosen the effect, you spend a season and compare your Lab Total to the level of the effect. For every 5 points, or fraction thereof, by which you exceed the level, you get one charge, but if your Lab Total is exactly equal to the level, you get one charge rather than none. If your Lab Total exceeds the level by 1 to 5 points,

you still only get one charge. If your Lab Total is less than the level of the effect you cannot create charged items of this kind.

You may split the charges produced between as many physical objects as you wish, although each object must be identical. The objects could be arrows, which cast the spell when they strike the target, or potions, which have their effect on the person drinking them, or anything else you can imagine. You may also make fewer charges than your Lab Total would permit, if you so desire.

Charged items may be of any material or size, as they do not have to hold vis. Appropriate shapes and materials do grant bonuses to the Lab Total, as normal.

<span id="charged-items-example"></span>
== Charged Items Example ==

Mari Amwithig wants to make a wand that casts Agony of the Beast, but she doesn't have much vis, so she considers doing it as a charged item.

Agony of the Beast is a level 15 effect, and for a charged item she decides to leave it unchanged. She isn't planning to use the item against creatures with Magic Resistance, and it doesn't really matter if other people can use it.

Her Perdo Animal Lab Total is 15 (Perdo 12 + 3 from Puissant Art) + 7 (Animal) + 3 (Intelligence) +4 (Magic Theory) +5 (Magic aura at Semita Errabunda), a total of 34. As she knows the spell, she adds a similar spell bonus of +3, because the spell is third magnitude. In addition, a wand gives a +4 bonus to destroying things at a distance. This gives her a final total of 41. She could create the item even if she didn't know the spell, but she does get some benefit from her prior knowledge.

41 is 26 higher than the level of the effect, which means she gets six charges, five from the five fives by which she exceeds the level, and one from the one point that is the final fraction.

Neil, Mari's player, decides to look at making a lesser enchanted item instead, because Mari's Lab Total is a lot higher than the level of the spell.

<span id="shape-and-material"></span>
== Shape and Material ==

The first thing you must do for any magical device is choose the physical form of the item you wish to enchant — both the shape of the item and the item's material. Look at the Shape and Material Bonuses Table to see what sorts of items grant bonuses relevant to the types of enchantments you wish to place. An item with multiple materials and incorporating multiple shapes can grant several

bonuses, and they do stack. However, the highest bonus that you can receive to a single enchantment is equal to your Magic Theory — this represents your ability to tie all of the correspondences into your enchantment. It is possible to place an effect in an item that does not give any bonus to that effect, and a magus may want to do so if placing multiple effects in the same item. For a single effect, however, it normally makes sense to choose a shape or material that does offer a bonus.

You should also pay attention to mundane criteria as well as magical. Enchanting a gold sword might appeal to you, but such an item would be too heavy and soft to use in combat. And while a diamond might be perfect for your ring, do you have a diamond? You might have to go out into the dangerous world to find your materials, especially if your covenant is poor.

Before you begin the process of enchantment, you must acquire the item you will enchant, and note its size and composition.

<span id="enchanted-item-example"></span>
== Enchanted Item Example ==

Mari turns her attention to making her wand as a real enchanted item. A wand gives a +4 bonus to destroy things at a distance, which makes it a good choice. Animal bone also gives a +4 bonus. Unfortunately, Mari's Magic Theory is only 4, so she would get no additional bonus from making her wand from animal bone. She decides to stick with wood, which is less conspicuous.

<span id="preparation-for-enchantment"></span>
== Preparation for Enchantment ==

Invested devices are powerful items that require special preparation before any effective enchantments can be performed on them.

Once you have the physical item to enchant, you must spend a season preparing it. To do this, you must simply expend the time and a number of pawns of raw Vim vis equal to the number derived from the &quot;Material and Size Table&quot; for the form you have selected.

It is possible to enchant only part of an item. For example, you can enchant a ruby on the end of a staff. Because it is on a staff, the gem gains bonuses appropriate to the shape (but not the material) of the staff (see the Shape and Material Bonuses Table), and you don't have to enchant the whole staff. However, any effect that relies on the attachment of gem and staff for a bonus (for example, any spell in the gem that uses a Shape bonus for the staff) is permanently lost if

the two are separated. When you enchant a part of an item, you must use the number of pawns of vis that would be required to enchant that part if it were a separate item.

It is also possible to prepare a compound item for enchantment, so that you get the shape and material bonuses from all the components for all effects. For example, you might want to enchant a wooden staff, shod in iron, with a quartz crystal bound on the top. There are two ways to do this, but you must select one when the item is first prepared, and the choice cannot be changed later. Work out how many pawns of vis it would take to prepare each component for enchantment. You may then either prepare it with a number of pawns equal to the sum of the pawns for each component, or with a number of pawns equal to the highest required by a single component. The example staff would take eight pawns to prepare the staff alone (a large wooden item), five pawns for the iron shoeing (tiny base metal item), and twelve pawns for the quartz (tiny semi-precious gem). Thus, the whole complex can be prepared at a cost of twelve pawns or twenty five pawns. A compound item of this sort may not contain more components than your Magic Theory score, as binding disparate things together magically takes some skill.

It is not possible to 'partially' open a single item. For example, a wooden staff must always be opened with eight pawns of vis; it is not possible to use fewer. It is possible for an item to have a vis capacity that makes it impossible for a magus to open it for enchantment, due to the limit on the number of pawns of vis he can use in a single season.

It is possible to prepare even larger items than &quot;huge&quot; items on the table. The multiplier increases by one for every factor of ten by which the item is larger than a huge item; for example, something one hundred times the size of a small room, such as a castle keep, would have a multiplier of x7. There are two problems that make this very uncommon. The first, which is less serious, is that the whole item must be opened, which requires the magus to handle a large amount of vis. The more serious issue is that the whole item must be inside the magus's laboratory. Even one factor of 10 makes an item too large to fit in a standard Hermetic laboratory; see page 286 for rules for making a larger laboratory.

An item that has been prepared for enchantment is useless for any magical purpose until it is attuned as a talisman, or instilled with magical powers.

<span id="enchanted-item-example-1"></span>
== Enchanted Item Example ==

A wooden wand is a small wooden object, and thus can only contain four pawns of vis. As Mari is making a Lesser Enchantment she doesn't need to open the item, but she can still only invest four pawns worth of effects. This isn't a problem, with a Lab Total of 41 the highest level effect she can invest is 20, which takes just two pawns.

<span id="instilling-offects"></span>
== Instilling Offects ==

The effects instilled in enchanted items are designed like spells, but they are not spells. In particular, a magus may instill an effect in a device even if he does not know a spell with the same effect. Designing an effect takes no time above and beyond the time spent to instill the effect in the item.

<span id="designing-the-effect"></span>
== Designing the Effect ==

First, choose an effect to be invested in your device and determine its level. An effect is like a spell, and must be fully defined, as a spell is. You may base the effect on a spell from the Spells chapter, or may invent your own effect. If inventing a new effect, you must design the effect carefully, as if inventing a new spell. The level of the effect is the equivalent of its spell level. You should confirm your effect level with the troupe. Note the starting level of the effect, for future reference. This is the effect level, and is used when assessing the effects produced by the enchanted device — for example, whether they cause Warping, or whether a maga succeeds in dispelling one. Choices made in the rest of this process may change this level, determining the modified effect level. This is used when dealing with the enchanted device itself, for example when investing the effects in the laboratory, or trying to disenchant a device.

Although the effect is based on the spell guidelines, it is not a spell, and the magus need not know the spell that would correspond to the effect. On the other hand, he gets a bonus if he does (see page 260).

In general, enchanted devices may not mimic the effects of Ritual spells. There is, however, a single exception. Enchanted device effects may have a level over 50, as long as there is no other reason for the spell to be a ritual, such as Year duration, Boundary target, or major effect.

After laying out the parameters of the effect, you must decide how frequently you use the effect. Consult the &quot;Effect Frequency Table.&quot; The number you choose corresponds to a modifier, which is added to the level of the effect.

Next you must specify the conditions under which the effect is triggered. A trigger can involve a command word or phrase, moving the item in a specific way (for example, waving or pointing a wand), a stance to be adopted, or anything physical that you can imagine. Most enchanted items cannot read thoughts, so the trigger action must be physical, not mental. By default, the trigger action must be performed by someone holding the item, although intention does not matter. Wands with offensive powers usually have very specific triggers, to make sure that they do

not go off by accident; some other items trigger whenever they are put on.

It is possible to modify an effect (see below) so that it is triggered by conditions in its immediate environment. This might include an item that triggers at sunrise and sunset.

Effects can also be linked to a second effect (see below) so that they trigger depending on the result of the second effect. By linking an effect to an Intellego Mentem effect which works whenever the device is held it is possible to produce an effect triggered by thought or intention. Any number of effects can be linked to a single triggering, and may depend in different ways on the result of that effect. Thus, if two powers are linked to a mind-reading effect, one might trigger when the wielder thinks 'Fire' with the intention of activating the item, and the other when the wielder thinks 'Ice' with the same intention

<span id="effect-modifications"></span>
== '''Effect Modifications''' ==

You have some options on how effects in an enchanted device operate. They are listed below. These modifications change the &quot;standards&quot; for enchanted devices.

'''Penetration''': You may elect to give the effect nonzero Penetration. For every level you add to the effect's level, that effect gets +2 Penetration. If there are multiple effects in a device, each must be given a Penetration score separately.

Concentration: When investing an effect, you can arrange to have the device maintain concentration on the effect for the wielder. This option adds +5 to the effect's level. Note that the wielder still needs to concentrate to change how the effect is used. For instance, a levitation belt that does not require concentration can hold someone in the air, but to move up or down the wielder must concentrate. Effects left to their own concentration start to wear off at sunset and sunrise. At these times the wielder must concentrate on the effect for a few moments to perpetuate it until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever comes first. This effect is useful for things like invisibility rings, which have their effect when put on, and then maintain concentration and invisibility until removed. This

allows the wearer to end the effect at will, and start it again if the device still has uses left.

The item can only maintain one instance of the effect at a time, unless the same effect is invested in the same item multiple times. For example, a wand of invisibility that can make a person invisible six times per day and maintain concentration can only make one person invisible at a time. However, if the wand were instead invested with six effects each of which could be used once per day, and maintained concentration, then it could make six people invisible at once. This would require more vis, more seasons, and a different trigger for each effect.

Effect Use: You can restrict the use of a device's effect to a specific list of people (for example, to you and all your current apprentices) by adding +3 to the level of the effect. You work the identities of these people into the enchantment itself, so the list can never be changed, nor can the restriction be bypassed.

You may also restrict the use of the device to an undefined group, such as 'only women', or 'only people in my direct magical lineage' by using a linked trigger (see below).

Otherwise, invested devices can be activated by anyone who knows their trigger actions.

Effect Expiry: It is possible to instill an effect which will only work for a limited period. This period is counted from the first use of the effect, not from its creation. A single item may mix temporary and permanent effects. Limiting an effect in this way multiplies the amount by which the magus's Lab Total exceeds the modified level of the effect, allowing him to instill effects more quickly. It does not allow him to instill effects he could not otherwise manage. Effect Expiry cannot be applied to Lesser Enchanted Items or Charged Items.

Environmental Trigger: The effect is triggered by some feature of the item's environment, rather than a specific action. The item is only sensitive to major magical features of the environment. Thus, it can respond to the events that end spell durations (sunrise, sunset, phases of the moon, etc.), and to changes in the modifier applied to magical activities by the local aura. This adds +3 to the level of the effect.

Fast Trigger: The effect gains a +3 Initiative modifier. This adds +5 to the level of the effect.

<span id="constant-effect-devices"></span>
=== Constant Effect Devices ===

An enchanted device can have a constant effect by giving the effect a duration of Sun, two uses per day, and an environmental trigger (sunrise or sunset). This adds two magnitudes (to raise the duration to Sun) and four levels (one for two uses per day and three for an environmental trigger) to the guideline given in the Spells chapter for the effect. Such a device has a truly continuous effect, there are no 'flickers' at sunrise or sunset.

Linked Trigger: The effect is triggered by the results of another effect in the same item. This is most commonly used to allow an item to activate on a mental command, or to limit the people who can use an item. An effect to allow mental activation needs to be able to read surface thoughts continually, with at least Touch Range. This is a base level of 15, +1 magnitude for Touch Range, +1 magnitude for Concentration Duration, +5 levels to have the device maintain concentration, for a final level of 30.

If a linked trigger effect is resisted, the item will not work, but the wielder can choose not to resist.

A linked trigger adds +3 to the level of the triggered effect. The level of the triggering effect is not altered.

<span id="enchanted-item-example-2"></span>
== Enchanted Item Example ==

Mari doesn't want any Penetration, and just wants the basic Agony of the Beast effect. That sets the base level at 15. Neil notes that he can raise the level to 20 without the process costing any more vis or taking any longer, so he might as well. The only addition that seems worthwhile is additional uses per day, so he decides to have Mari make a wand that can be used 24 times per day, as that adds five levels to the base fifteen, for a final level of 20.

<span id="instilling-the-offect"></span>
== Instilling the Offect ==

Once you have designed the effect that you want to invest in your device, you have to perform the ritual of joining. Your Lab Total (based on the Form and Technique scores appropriate to the effect) is compared to the total modified effect level. Several other modifiers apply to your Lab Total:

* If the effect you are investing mimics a spell with casting requisites, those requisites apply to your Lab Total.
* If any of the bonuses listed on the &quot;Shape and Material Bonuses Table&quot; for the material or shape of the device you are using matches the effect being invested, those bonuses are added to your Lab Total. For example, if you were enchanting a lamp to constantly produce magical light, you would add +7 to your Lab Total. Your total bonus from the shape and material of the device may not exceed your Magic Theory score. This represents the ability of the magus to tie all the correspondences into the enchantment.
* For each effect already in the device that has a Technique and/or Form in common with the effect being invested, add +1 to your Lab Total. The bonus is +1 per preexisting effect, even if it matches both the Technique and Form.
* If you know a spell that is similar to the effect you are instilling, add the magnitude of the spell to your Lab Total. You only get this bonus for the highest-level applicable spell.

You can only invest an effect if this modified Lab Total exceeds the modified level of the effect. For each point by which your total

exceeds the level, you accumulate 1 point per season. When you accumulate points equal to the effect's modified level, you invest the power. Thus, if your Lab Total is double the modified level of the effect, you can invest it in one season. For lesser enchantments, your Lab Total must be at least double the modified level of the effect.

For every 10 points, or fraction thereof, of the modified level of the effect, you must also expend one pawn of raw vis of an Art matching either the Technique or Form of the effect being invested. This vis is expended in the first season you begin investing the effect. But remember, a given item can only hold a limited number of effects. If the amount of raw vis required to instill an effect brings the total amount of raw vis used above the total used to prepare the item for enchantment in the first place, the effect cannot be invested. So if you are enchanting a silver dagger (which takes 12 pawns of vis to prepare for enchantment), you can only put 12 pawns worth of effects in it. If the dagger already has 10 pawns worth of effects, an effect that requires 3 pawns of vis (that is, an effect of level 21 to 30) does not fit; you cannot put it in the dagger.

<span id="enchanted-item-example-3"></span>
== Enchanted Item Example ==

Mari has, as calculated before, a Perdo Animal Lab Total of 41, which allows her to invest a level 20 effect in a single season. She gets one pawn of Perdo vis and one pawn of Animal vis, and uses them to invest the wand. The process is automatically successful.

Wand of Bestial Agony: This plain wooden wand can cast Agony of the Beast 24 times per day, with 0 Penetration.

<span id="using-enchanted-devices"></span>
== Using Enchanted Devices ==

Several rules apply to all enchanted devices, unless an effect modification has been made, and specifically states otherwise.

* Effects produced by enchanted devices have a Penetration of zero.
* The range of effects is measured from the device, not the user. Thus, Touch Range means that the device must touch the target, and Personal Range means that the effect targets the device only.
* Unless otherwise specified, an effect that duplicates a spell requiring concentration to maintain also must be concentrated on to be maintained.
* All Targeting rolls demanded by a device's effects are made by the wielder of the device, using the wielder's Finesse score.
* If a person gains possession of your magical device and knows the triggering actions of its effects, that person may utilize the device. Even if the possessor does not know the triggering action, he may investigate your item in the laboratory to learn its effects.
* You may perform one trigger action for an enchanted item in a round. In most cases, this will activate one effect, but some items may be designed so that one action activates multiple effects. You must make any Targeting rolls that are necessary, but do not roll for Fatigue. You use an enchanted device at an Initiative point equal to Qik + Stress Die.
* If the enchanted device is broken, all its powers are lost.
* You may use an enchanted item before it is &quot;filled up&quot; with effects and still add effects later.

<span id="talisman-attunement"></span>
== Talisman Attunement ==

Talismans help you concentrate and extend your magical powers. A talisman is a very personal item that contains magics and materials that tie it intimately to you and that can be used as a channel for your magical power.

You can only attune an item as your talisman if you prepared it for enchantment yourself. Attuning an item takes one season, and can be done whatever your Lab Total. A magus can only have one talisman at once, and must completely destroy an older talisman before creating a new one. This means that the vis and time invested in the first talisman are lost. A magus cannot make a talisman for someone else.

A magus may attune an item with instilled effects as his talisman, as long as he instilled all the effects personally. An item which has been worked on by more than one magus cannot be attuned as a talisman. It is, however, possible to attune an enchanted item if the primary creator was assisted in the lab by another Gifted individual (see Help in the Laboratory, page 264).

Attuning an item as your talisman has several effects.

First, your talisman is considered to be a part of you as long as you are touching it. Personal range spells can affect your talisman, Personal range effects in the talisman can affect you, and you count as touching anything that your talisman is touching, so if your talisman is a staff your reach is significantly extended. This also means that your Magic Resistance covers your talisman completely as long as you are touching it.

Second, you always have an Arcane Connection to your talisman, making it easy to find if it is lost (but also making it a hazard if it falls into enemy hands).

Third, even when you're not touching your talisman, it receives the Magic Resistance offered by your Form scores.

Finally, a talisman becomes very easy to enchant, and its capacity for enchantment is greatly increased. The capacity of a talisman is independent of its shape and material, and instead depends on the power of the magus to whom it is attuned. The maximum number of pawns of Vim vis that may be used to prepare a talisman is equal to the sum of the magus's highest Technique and highest Form. Unlike other items, the capacity of a talisman may be opened a bit at a time. A magus could open one pawn's worth every season if he wished, although that is inefficient.

When a magus instills effects into a talisman, he gets a +5 bonus to his Lab Total, reflecting his close connection to the item. However, it is impossible for any other magus to instill an effect in the device.

In addition to the basic powers of a talisman, you may also open your talisman to one kind of magic attunement, based on the shape and material of the talisman, every time you prepare it for enchantment or instill an effect. Use the &quot;Shape and Material Bonuses

Table&quot; to determine what attunements are possible. Your talisman may be able to accept more than one kind of attunement, and can hold more than one attunement, but you can only invest one new attunement per season. For instance, a magus can enhance his staff talisman by attuning it to spells that control things at a distance. He then gets a +4 bonus on his Casting Score for spells that control things at a distance (because that is the bonus listed on the Shape and Material Bonuses Table). He could further enhance it to give him a +3 to project bolts and missiles (for example), but that would have to be done while he was instilling another effect.

Bonuses from attunements only apply when the magus is touching the talisman, and only the highest bonus applies. They apply to Casting Scores for Ritual, Formulaic and Spontaneous magic, but they do not apply to Magic Resistance or any laboratory activities. There is no limit to the number of attunements a talisman can have at one time, though remember that you can only add one per season. There is no roll involved in giving your talisman an attunement bonus.

<span id="investigating-enchantments"></span>
== Investigating Enchantments ==

If you wish to determine the powers of someone else's enchantment, you must investigate it in your lab. You inspect the item's physical construction, investigate the Form and Technique with Intellego magics, and test to see how the enchantment responds to other magics. All of this indicates how the item was created, what its powers are, and how to unleash them.

You discover the powers in an enchanted device in order from weakest to strongest — that is, from the power of the lowest modified effect level to that of the highest. (A device's function as a talisman is treated as a level 20 power.) When you investigate an enchantment for the first time, you spend a season, add a stress die to your Intellego Vim Lab Total, and compare the result to the level of the weakest power in the enchantment. If you succeed in your roll to find the weakest power, you may roll again in that same season to identify the power immediately above it in strength. For example, if a device has three powers of level 10, 20, and 30 and you rolled a Lab Total of 25, you do not automatically find the first two powers. As your rolled Lab Total is over 10 (the level of the first power), you find the first power and may roll again in the season to find the second power (level 20), and the third power if you discover the second. Note that the level of a power in an enchanted device includes any effect modifications that apply to the power.

As long as you succeed in finding powers, you keep rolling to find more in that season. If you roll and find nothing, it either means that there are no more powers in the enchantment or that you did not roll high enough to find the next one. Only

the storyguide knows for certain. In either case, you can keep trying as long as you want, but each failure to discover a power ends the rolls for that season, and you can do nothing else that season.

If you botch an investigation roll, many results can arise, and the storyguide makes the final decision based on the situation. You could misinterpret a power, thinking it does something different from its actual function. You could misread the triggering action of a power, making it useless to you. Or you could somehow disturb the enchanted item, setting off its powers. If you survive an investigation botch, your season ends there. However, you may approach the device again next season to properly identify the power that confounded you.

Magi sometimes use the Waiting Spell (see page 372) to guard their enchanted devices. The spell held in waiting is often released on anyone who magically examines the item. The Waiting Spell is not invested into the device, but cast on it for protection. You therefore cannot detect a Waiting Spell in your preliminary investigations of an item. If you do not cast a spell to detect a Waiting Spell, discovering it often means tripping it. Beware.

<span id="similar-spells"></span>
== Similar Spells ==

magus gets some benefit from knowing a spell similar to the effect he is creating. He gets a bonus to his Lab Total equal to the magnitude of the highest-

level similar spell that he knows. Only a single spell grants a bonus; there is no laboratory advantage to knowing dozens of similar spells.

Similar Spell Bonus: Magnitude of highest-level similar spell known

A spell is similar if it meets one of the following requirements:

* Same effect, at a different Range, Duration, or Target. All three may differ.
* Closely related effect, at the same Range, Duration, and Target.

Two spells have the same effect if the rules description of the spell is the same, apart from the Range, Duration, or Target. Closely related effects include such things as doing damage with Creo Ignem, or turning a human being into a land animal. This is, ultimately, a judgment call on the part of the troupe. The similar spell bonus is not, generally, very large, so there is no problem with erring on the side of generosity.

In their attempts to gain themselves more time in this world, the magi of Hermes have developed Longevity Rituals. Though death is still inevitable, these rituals can stave it off for a hundred years or more. Magi of two hundred years or older are rare, but not unheard of.

The Longevity Ritual creates a magical anchor, sustaining the vital life force of the magus, often by directly affecting the tissues of the magus's body. This anchor, however, prevents the magus from expending his life force in normal human fashion, so the magus becomes permanently sterile. The ritual takes a season, and culminates in some sort of focus, which is appropriate to the magus in question. The most common form of the focus is a potion which the magus drinks, but it could be a bath, a ritual in which the magus inhales the smoke of special incense, or even a magical fire that the magus stands within to burn away the impurities that cause aging. The focus is always something that can be repeated, and does not require continuing actions or the possession of an object. Magi who have a potion as a focus often refer to their longevity potion; magi with different foci use different terms as appropriate, but if they feel that the nature of the focus is too revealing, they might refer simply to the Longevity Ritual.

The Longevity Ritual takes one season to develop and perform, and the subject of the ritual must be present for the whole of that season. If appropriate, he may help the magus creating the ritual with his lab work (see page 264).

Every magus has a unique Longevity Ritual, though it is possible for a magus to create a Longevity Ritual for another. Indeed, many young magi hire older magi to devise their Longevity Rituals, as the older magus's higher Lab Total makes the ritual much more effective. It

is most common for a magus to pay his parens for this, and in some parts of the Order this is almost an expected custom.

LONGEVITY RITUAL:

+1 bonus for every five points or fraction of Creo Corpus Lab Total

Longevity Ritual Vis Cost: 1 pawn for every five years of age (rounded up)

Normally, only Creo, Corpus, and Vim vis may be used in a Longevity Ritual. However, a Longevity Ritual is a very personal creation, and as such, it is uniquely tied to your magical abilities. You may, with the approval of the troupe or storyguide, substitute any type of vis that your magical talents are strongly associated with.

A Longevity Ritual's effect lasts until you suffer an aging crisis (see &quot;Aging&quot; on page 391). After this, the ritual loses its effectiveness and the focus must be repeated. You can invent a new ritual

(following the normal rules for doing so), or perform the ritual from the old ritual again. This involves simply making a new investment of vis (of an amount based on your current age) but no significant investment in time. You must have the Laboratory Text (see page 262) from the original ritual to do this, and this is the only benefit from a Longevity Ritual's Laboratory Text. If your Longevity Ritual fails and you make aging rolls before you create a new one, you suffer the full effects of your

age. You do not gain back any Aging Points or Decrepitude Points that you suffered when you were not under the effects of a ritual when you do finally perform a new ritual.

When creating a Longevity Ritual for the first time, you can increase its potency by adding extra vis to the ceremony. This vis is above and beyond that which you must spend for your current age. For each additional pawn you add to the ritual, add 1 to your Lab Total. This vis is invested when you originally create a given version of a ritual, but you must use the same amount of extra vis every time you perform the focus again after the ritual fails. If you reinvent the ritual to take advantage of increased Art scores, you can choose not to use extra vis.

You can perform Longevity Rituals for others, even for nonmagi. To do so, you need a Creo

Corpus Lab Total of at least 30. A Longevity Ritual made for another magus or a character with a Supernatural Ability functions just as if made for you (-1 to aging rolls for every 5 points of Lab Total). Non-magical people, however, are not as resilient as magi. The ritual you create for a mundane therefore only subtracts one from the character's aging rolls for every 10 points (round up) in your Lab Total. A Longevity Ritual performed for someone else also fails when the subject suffers from an aging crisis. If the subject is a magus and has access to the Laboratory Text, he may perform the ritual himself. (Vis usage is limited by the magus's Arts, as for a spell, which may make it impossible.) As the magus was present for the original creation of the ritual, and quite possibly assisting in it, he understands the shorthand. A subject who is not a Hermetic magus may not repeat the ritual. Any magus with access to the Laboratory Text may do this, no matter what his Lab Total, but a magus who was not involved in the initial creation needs an accessible Laboratory Text.

<span id="laboratory-texts"></span>
== Laboratory Texts ==

hen a magus creates something in the laboratory, he keeps a set of notes recording what he has done, what worked, and what didn't. With the aid of these

notes he, or another magus, can reproduce the effect much more quickly, as he knows exactly what he should be doing.

One Laboratory Text is created for every effect that the magus creates. Thus, a magus creates a single Laboratory Text when he invents a single spell, or invests a single power into an enchanted item.

The most common Laboratory Texts in the Order of Hermes are those detailing the creation of spells. Almost every covenant has a substantial collection of these, as they at least double the speed at which magi can add new Formulaic spells to their repertoire.

<span id="using-laboratory-texts"></span>
== '''Using Laboratory Texts''' ==

A magus who has a Laboratory Text for a particular effect may reproduce it in a single season if his Lab Total equals or exceeds the level of the effect. If his Lab Total is less than the level of the effect, he may not use the Laboratory Text until his Lab Total increases to be at least equal to the level. A magus may reproduce multiple effects if they are all of the same Technique and Form, and the total of their levels is no greater than his Lab Total. The Lab Total is calculated in exactly the same way when working from a Laboratory Text as when working without one.

This is an almost exact reproduction of the original effect. No features of a spell or enchanted item effect may be changed, and in the case of an enchanted item, the item itself must have the same shape and material as the one described in the text. However, it is possible to use a text derived from enchanting a power into an item with multiple powers to enchant that power alone. It is not possible to use the Laboratory Text from a lesser enchanted device to instill a power in a greater device, or vice versa, nor can any other magus make use of a Lab Text concerned with instilling an effect into a talisman. The main difference between the two effects is that your sigil, rather than the original magus's, is incorporated.

If the Laboratory Text is for a charged item, the magus produces an item with a number of charges equal to one fifth of his Lab Total, rounded up.

The Laboratory Text for a Longevity Ritual only allows the magus to reproduce the final ritual without needing to spend a season on the process.

It is not possible to experiment (see page 274) while working from a Laboratory Text. The benefit comes from following the procedures exactly, which is inconsistent with experimentation. It is, of course, possible to look at a Laboratory Text and then experiment to create an almost identical effect, but the magus would get no benefit from the Laboratory Text.

<span id="laboratory-texts-example"></span>
== Laboratory Texts Example ==

Carolus decides that he needs at least one combat spell, or he risks being in serious trouble if he gets caught stealing. Given his magical strengths, he decides to look at Perdo Corpus. His Perdo Corpus Lab Total is 10 (Perdo) + 5 (Corpus) + 2 (Intelligence) + 4 (Magic Theory) + 1 (Magic Theory is specialized in inventing spells) + 5 (Aura of Semita Errabunda), for a total of 27. He could invent a level 13 spell by himself in a season, but that wouldn't be much use.

Fortunately, the covenant library has a Lab Text for ''Grip of the Choking Hand''. This spell is level 25, which would take him 13 seasons to invent by himself. His Lab Total is 2 higher than the level, so after thirteen seasons he would have accumulated 26 points, and thus invented the spell. Working from the Lab Text, however, he can invent the spell in a single season.

Laboratory Texts are not immediately useful to others, however, as they include all sorts of personal abbreviations and shortcuts that others cannot understand. (Remember that everything is written by hand in the Middle Ages.)

If you would like to copy a Laboratory Text of yours so others can easily use it, you can spend a season rewriting up to (Latin x 20) levels of Laboratory Texts to make them usable by others. Also, in one season, you can copy (Profession: Scribe x 60) levels of Laboratory Texts that are already written understandably. Note that copying is a different skill from writing from scratch. It is entirely possible for a skilled writer to be faster at writing than copying.

Any person who assisted in a particular Laboratory Activity, adding their Intelligence + Magic Theory to the Lab Total, understands the Laboratory Texts produced for that activity without needing to translate them, and may make generally accessible copies. This also applies to a magus who is the subject of a Longevity Ritual created by another magus, even if he does not assist. Assistants do not, however, create Laboratory Texts.

Writing Laboratory Texts: Latin x 20 levels per season

Copying Laboratory Texts: Profession: Scribe x 60 levels per season

<span id="casting-tablets-1"></span>
== Casting Tablets ==

A Casting Tablet is a variant on a Laboratory Text that contains a simple series of instructions for casting a particular spell. Magi who have not learned the spell's intricacies through laboratory research may use a Casting Tablet instead. Casting from tablets is dangerous, because the magus is calling on power that he cannot control accurately. Casting from tablets is also an inflexible style of spellcasting.

A magus casting from a tablet does not understand the spell's workings, and so may not tinker with decisions made by the author. The Range, Duration, Target, and size of the spell, the exact amount and Arts of raw vis consumed, and any single type of Arcane Connection to be used, are specified by the author at writing. Spells cast from tablets do not have Penetration bonuses unless they are built into the spell's level by the author.

Rituals may be cast from tablets. It is possible, but dangerous, for a magus with a tablet to lead a Wizard's Vigil. A botch by any member of the group causes the leader also to botch. An odd effect of casting from a tablet is that the sigil of the writer is preserved in the spell, and is visible along with the sigil of the caster.

When casting from a tablet, determine the magus's Casting Total according to the following formula, then subtract the spell level from the

Casting Total and look up the result on the table that follows. Use this formula for both Formulaic and Ritual spells. The table replaces the normal results for casting either type of spell. For Formulaic spells, the Fatigue levels lost are short-term, and for Ritual spells they are long-term.

CASTING TOTAL:

Stamina + Form + Technique + Aura + stress die (modified by Virtues, Flaws and requisites)

CASTING TOTAL - SPELL LEVEL:

Magi can only author Casting Tablets for spells they have mastered (see page 225), although anyone can copy tablets written by others. A character spending a season as an author or copyist may create Laboratory Texts or Casting 0 or more Spell cast, lose one Fatigue level.

* −1 to −10 Spell cast, lose two Fatigue levels.
* −11 to −20 Spell cast, lose three Fatigue levels.
* −21 to −30 Spell cast. Gain a Warping point. Lose four Fatigue levels.
* -31 or less Gain Warping points equal to the magnitude of the spell, lose five Fatigue levels. If the caster gains two or more Warping Points, he must check for Twilight.

Tablets from the same pool of levels. Casting Tablets do not aid magi to learn spells the way Laboratory Texts do.

<span id="translating-laboratory-texts"></span>
== Translating Laboratory Texts ==

If you want to translate the Laboratory Texts of another magus whose secrets and abbreviations you do not know, you must work out his system of abbreviations. Every season you spend studying one of his texts, you accumulate a number of points equal to your Lab Total in the appropriate Technique and Form. Once you have accumulated points equal to or exceeding the level of the effect, you understand the text. This is a process of experimentation, and thus requires a laboratory.

Once you have understood a magus's abbreviations for one Laboratory Text, you may write up any of his Laboratory Texts as if they were your own (that is, Latin x 20 levels per season), as long as none of them exceed the level of the text you decoded. This is a simple process of translation, and does not require a laboratory. If you come across a higher level text, you must decode that separately, but you start with a

number of accumulated points equal to the level of the highest level text you have translated. Note that Laboratory Texts cannot be translated into Casting Tablets.

As noted above, laboratory assistants automatically understand the Laboratory Texts for the activities with which they helped. This also helps them to translate other Laboratory Texts by the same magus. A magus may also teach someone his (or another maga's) abbreviations, by spending a season writing Laboratory Texts with that person present, and explaining the abbreviations. In that case, the student counts as understanding Laboratory Texts by that magus with a level up to the teacher's Latin x 20. Note that such students need not have The Gift, but must be literate in Latin and have a score of at least 1 in Magic Theory to write or copy Laboratory Texts without corrupting them (see page 380).

<span id="multiple-laboratory-activities"></span>
== Multiple Laboratory Activities ==

ometimes you may wish to perform laboratory activities that, though rewarding, are well within your capabilities. In this case, you may choose to

perform multiple activities within a single season, splitting your time among them all. All the activities you perform in a season must be of the same type (for example, learning spells, instilling powers in an invested device, creating potions) and must use the same Technique and Form. Some or all of the activities may be based on Laboratory Texts. To perform multiple activities, simply add up the levels of all activities performed and apply your Lab Total to the total of the levels.

If the Lab Totals for the different activities are different, due to requisites, a Magical Focus, or similar, apply the lowest of the Lab Totals to the total of the levels.

If you perform arcane experimentation (page 274), you add a single simple die + risk modifier to your Lab Total, but any results rolled on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart&quot; apply to all activities performed in the season.

<span id="help-in-the-laboratory"></span>
= help in the Laboratory =

hough the Code of Hermes provides protection for magi who meet on neutral grounds, the sanctum of a magus (laboratory and living quarters)

is a special place in which magi hold their greatest treasures and deepest secrets. Thus, the Code of Hermes allows for magi to exact any toll on magi who trespass within their sancta. Because one magus foregoes protection of the Code when in the laboratory sanctum of another, very few magi ever cooperate in laboratory work.

Nevertheless, there are times when magi receive help in their laboratory work, either from trusting magi or from apprentices. Anyone who has The Gift and a score of at least one in Magic Theory may help you to perform any activity that uses your Magic Theory. If you are being helped to perform some activity that uses your Magic Theory, you add the helper's Intelligence + Magic Theory to your Lab Total for the season. Any helper's Virtues and Flaws affect the Lab Total, in the same way as those of the primary magus. If this total is negative, the 'assistant' imposes a penalty on your Lab Total. If the assistant has some appropriate Virtue or Flaw, like Inventive Genius, that Virtue or Flaw applies to the primary researcher's efforts.

Thus, when two magi cooperate, one must always be the primary researcher and one must be the assistant. This research may take place outside the sanctum of either magus (see The Sanctum, page 297), in which case both parties are protected by the Code. However, the assistant is announcing to the Order that he considers the primary researcher to be his superior. This substantially limits the range of magi that most members of the Order are willing to assist. A magus is conventionally supposed to regard his parens as superior throughout his life, so helping your parens attracts no stigma, even for those magi who actually regard their parentes with contempt.

You may not normally have more than one helper in the lab, as it is difficult to coordinate several helpers with you and with each other. However, if people are exceptionally well-organized and cooperative, more can work together, each helper adding his Magic Theory and Intelligence scores to the primary researcher's scores. The total number of assistants that the primary researcher can make use of in one season is limited to his

Leadership score (though he can always have at least one). The exception is that a magus with a familiar may always have at least one assistant in addition to his familiar, this does not increase the maximum if he has a Leadership score of 2 or more.

Lab assistants gain exposure experience, typically in Magic Theory, but do not gain anything else from the experience.

<span id="distractions-from-lab-work"></span>
= Distractions from Lab Work =

he rules for what a magus can do in a season assume that the season is uninterrupted. Sometimes, however, magi take time away from their labs to

travel and explore, and this lost time makes itself felt in their lab performance.

You may miss up to ten days from any laboratory activity, and make up the time by working harder during the remainder of the season. There is no penalty for this. However, if you miss eleven days or more, your Lab Total is

rotective of their secrets and suspicious of any who might hold power over them, magi are notoriously distant from other people. They can find

some companionship with apprentices, but the master-apprentice bond often atrophies after the apprentice becomes a magus, and sometimes former master and former apprentice become rivals. For longer-lasting and deeper companionship, many magi turn to a familiar.

A familiar is a beast that a magus befriends and then magically bonds with, instilling the beast with magical powers in the process and then using magic to merge its powers and abilities with his own. Though a familiar is very close to the magus who creates it, it always has its own will, and is not under the control of the magus. The familiar is the closest friend and ally a magus will ever have... but even friends fight occasionally.

<span id="finding-and-befriending-an-animal"></span>
== Finding and Befriending an Animal ==

The first step in getting a familiar is finding an animal with inherent magic. With inherent magic, the beast is likely to have a Magic Might score, which may be assigned based on the scores of comparable magical creatures. The means of finding such a creature are ultimately left to the storyguide to determine. Wandering at random in search of a magical creature is usually profitless — magi generally follow rumors to the locations of the familiars they want. Some receive visions of animals that are somehow &quot;meant&quot; for them.

Once found, the animal must be befriended. You must genuinely admire or even love the animal in question, and it must trust you freely, under no coercion, magical or mundane. The animal can sense something of your nature when you are in close contact. If your natures clash, it rejects you. The need for mutual admiration between magus and familiar is why air magi, for example, often take birds as familiars, and why you can often tell something about magi by the familiars they have chosen and that have chosen them.

<span id="enchanting-the-familiar"></span>
== '''Enchanting the Familiar''' ==

Once you and the familiar accept each other, you take the animal to your laboratory and begin a series of enchantments. Enchanting a familiar is different from other enchantments. The bond between you and your familiar causes changes to you both, and you do not have full control over how the enchantment affects you. Your troupe and storyguide determine how you are affected throughout the enchantment, though you do have control over the changes your familiar undergoes.

<span id="the-initial-bond"></span>
== The Initial Bond ==

The laboratory total for binding the familiar is any appropriate Technique + any appropriate Form + Int + Magic Theory + Aura Modifier. Puissant Arts and foci may apply to this. A Technique or Form is appropriate if it corresponds in some way to the animal or its powers. Thus, Animal and Vim are always appropriate Forms for binding magical animals. Aquam is appropriate for aquatic or semiaquatic animals, and Auram for birds, or creatures with power over air or weather. Corpus applies to animals that can take human form, or with powers to heal or transform people. Herbam might be appropriate to arboreal creatures, or to beasts with powers over plants. Ignem is suitable for firebreathing or shining creatures, and Imaginem for those that change their appearance. Mentem fits any animal that has a true mind, or which can affect the minds of people, while Terram is appropriate to burrowing animals or creatures with powers affecting earth, stone, or metal.

The Techniques are more likely to correspond to abilities of the animal. Builders, like beavers, correspond to Creo, while destroyers, like serpents, link to Perdo. Creatures that change, such as butterflies, match Muto, and those that control others, like the leaders of packs, fit with Rego. Intellego is appropriate to animals with sharp senses, like eagles or bats.

Any magus should be able to find an animal that he can bind with his best Technique and Form, and such an animal will automatically be in sympathy with the magus's magic.

The level for the enchantment is equal to 25 plus the familiar's Magic Might plus 5 times its Size. If the familiar has negative Size, this reduces the level for the enchantment. For example, a familiar with a Size of –2 and a Magic Might of 10 can be bound as a level 25 enchantment: 10 for the Magic Might, plus 25, minus 10 from the negative Size. A magus can only bind a familiar if his Lab Total equals or exceeds this level. If it does, he can bind the familiar in a single season. This costs one pawn of vis for every five points or fraction thereof of the Lab Total. The vis used must match either

<span id="suggested-familiars-by-art"></span>
== Suggested Familiars by Art ==

The Arts used to bond a familiar must correspond to either the animal itself, or its powers. The following list gives examples of animals that may be suited to particular Arts.

Creo: beaver, eagle, lizard, pelican, weasel, any animal that can rejuvenate itself

Intellego: cat (tortoiseshell), crow, goat, raven, woodpecker, toad, any animal with keen senses, any animal thought to foretell the future

Muto: cat (white or tortoiseshell), fox, hare, moths and butterflies, toad, other amphibians

Perdo: asp, hedgehog, salamander, shrew, weasel, any venomous animal

Rego: badger, cat (black), cockerel, dog, lion, owl, wolf, any pack leader or similarly dominant animal

Animal: any animal

Aquam: coot, duck, frog, kingfisher, otter, swan, any amphibious or semi-aquatic animal

Auram: crow, kingfisher, spider, any bird or bat

Corpus: caladrius, cat, dog, goose

Herbam: beaver, monkey, squirrel, woodpecker

Ignem: eagle, hercinia, salamander, scitalis, very small dragons

Imaginem: chameleon (lizard), cricket, magpie, partridge, peacock, scitalis

Mentem: ape, cat (black or tortoiseshell), fox, owl, wolf, any animal with an Intelligence score (before bonding)

Terram: badger, hedgehog, ferret, frog, fox, mole, mouse

Vim: hoopoe, any magical animal

Familiar's Magic Might + 25 + (5 x Size)

Familiar Bonding Cost:

1 pawn of vis per five levels or fraction of the binding Lab Total. Vis must match Technique or Form

<span id="the-three-cords"></span>
==== The Three Cords ====

As part of the process of binding a familiar, the magus forges three mystical cords. A golden cord connects the magus and familiar's magical abilities, a silver cord connects their minds, and a bronze cord connects their bodies. These cords may be seen by someone with the Second Sight Virtue, but they are otherwise imperceptible.

The strength of each of these cords is rated from 0 to +5. To determine all the cords' ratings, divide the points of the magus's Lab Total among them however you choose and then use the points allocated to each to buy cord scores. A cord strength of 0 costs nothing, a strength of +1 requires 5 points, a score of +2 requires 15 points, a score of +3 requires 30 points, a score of +4 requires 50 points, and a score of +5 (the maximum) requires 75 points. The total cost of the cords you buy cannot exceed the magus's Lab Total.

Each cord has a varying effect (described below) depending on how well it is forged. These benefits also apply to the familiar.

The Golden Cord: The familiar helps you avoid magical errors, letting you roll fewer botch rolls when using magic. Your golden cord score is the number subtracted from the number of botch dice you would normally roll (though the Golden Cord cannot reduce the number of botch dice to zero).

The Silver Cord: You can apply your silver cord score as a bonus to all rolls that involve Personality Traits, and to rolls to protect you from natural or supernatural mental influence, such as a spell, intimidation, or verbal trickery. In addition, if your mind is ever overcome by another force your familiar may be able to free you. To be successful, it must roll 9+ on a stress die with the silver cord score as its bonus (one attempt per day). If the roll botches, the animal's mind is overcome along with yours.

The Bronze Cord: You can apply your bronze cord score as a bonus to Soak rolls and totals, to healing rolls, to rolls to withstand deprivation (such as to holding your breath or resisting sleepiness), and to rolls to resist aging. It does not help you withstand Fatigue.

The magus binds a familiar by forging the cords, so both the initial bond and the forging of the cords take place in the same season.

The magus may choose to strengthen the bonds after binding the familiar. He must use the same Arts as for the initial binding, and may buy bond strengths with the new value of the Lab Total. This strengthening also takes a single season, and costs a number of pawns of vis equal to one fifth of the magus's Lab Total, rounded up, minus the number of pawns of vis already spent on binding the familiar. This does not include pawns of vis spent on empowering the bond (see below). Thus, the number of pawns of vis that must be spent to get cords of a certain strength remains the same whether the magus does it all at once, or over several seasons.

<span id="the-bound-familiar"></span>
== The Bound Familiar ==

The familiar binding gives both the magus and the familiar the Minor Virtue True Friend, relating to the other half of the partnership. Thus, they also gain Personality Traits of Loyal (partner) +3.

The familiar will not die of old age as long as the magus is alive, and it only suffers ill effects from aging when the magus does. If it did not previously have human intelligence, it gains it, with a score of –3. It gains a score equal to the magus in any languages that the magus speaks; any familiar can understand and read the languages understood by its master, and can speak them if it has the relevant vocal equipment. Familiars can learn Abilities in the same way as humans. They cannot, however, learn magic, although they can learn Magic Theory and serve as laboratory assistants, even though they do not have The Gift.

The magus and the familiar are magically linked. Each serves as an Arcane Connection to the other. Neither needs to overcome the other's Magic Resistance in order to affect them with a spell or magical ability.

The familiar uses the better of its Magic Resistance or the magus's Form resistance to resist spells, but this resistance does not stack with a Parma Magica. The magus may choose to use the familiar's Magic Resistance, but this does not stack with a Parma Magica.

Both the familiar and the magus retain any abilities that they had before the ritual was performed.

<span id="empowering-the-bond"></span>
== Empowering the Bond ==

A maga may, at any time, invest powers in the familiar bond. This is a laboratory activity, and the rules are the same as those for investing a power in an invested device, with four exceptions.

First, there is no limit to the number of powers which may be invested in a familiar.

Second, the maga gets no bonus to the Lab Total from other effects already invested in the

familiar. Instead, she gets +5 if the effect matches either the Technique or Form used to bind the familiar, and +10 if it matches both.

Third, powers are limited to effects which target the maga, the familiar, or both.

Finally, the benefits of Verditius Mysteries do not add to the Lab Total. The Mystery has nothing to do with familiars.

If the enchantment affects only the maga, it is activated by and under the control of the familiar. If it affects only the familiar, it is activated by and under the control of the maga. For the use of effects enchanted into the familiar bond, the maga and familiar are always considered to be touching one another.

Foci that cover the familiar apply to the investment of all powers, no matter what they do. Foci that cover the power apply as normal.

Every time the magus invests a power in the bond both the magus and the familiar take on some minor characteristic of the other. This is a purely cosmetic effect, but should be stronger the more powerful the effect.

While this process does produce a Laboratory Text, that text only applies to investing the power into the bond of this magus and familiar, and thus is rarely of any use to anyone, including the magus who creates it.

Investing a power into the bond costs the same as investing a power into an enchanted device: one pawn of vis for every ten levels, or fraction, of the modified effect. This vis must match the Technique or Form of the effect.

One very important benefit of enchanting a power into the familiar bond is that the power does not cause Warping (page 389) as a constant mystical effect.

<span id="the-familiar-in-play"></span>
== The Familiar in Play ==

You and your familiar will undoubtedly grow closer as the saga progresses, learning from each other and strengthening your common bond. Over the years, your familiar learns what you know, provided that you keep the familiar with you when you study and that you share your knowledge with it.

Your familiar ages along with you, generally dying a few days before or several weeks after you. The sudden death of your familiar is a warning of immediate danger. Should you ever die while your familiar remains alive, your familiar will experience a shock that may kill it, and even if it lives, it is reduced to a pathetic, devastated condition ever after. Likewise, if you survive your familiar, you may feel a profound emptiness in your life that lasts for months, or even years. Having a familiar is a personal, private thing, so only those more concerned with status than true companionship use their familiars as status symbols. You should hold the same level of protectiveness for your familiar that you would for a spouse.

You can only have one familiar at a time. Your familiar will be with you for a long time, so make it interesting.

<span id="example-powers"></span>
== Example Powers ==

Speech: Giving an animal the ability to form human speech is Muto Animal, with a base level of 5 (a minor change that makes the animal unnatural). The duration needs to be Concentration, with the bond maintaining concentration, and the range needs to be increased to Touch. This gives level 20. The maga needs to maintain the ability at sunrise and sunset, but can reactivate it once per day if she 'forgets'.

Mental communication: Two effects, each allowing one partner to communicate with the other. The effect is Creo Mentem, as one partner is creating things in the mind of the other. If only words can be transmitted, the base level is 3, plus one magnitude for Touch range, plus ten levels for unlimited use, which is 14. If more complex thoughts, such as images and emotions, can be transmitted, then the base level is four, plus one magnitude for Touch range, plus ten for unlimited use, for a final level of 15.

Shapechanging: The most efficient way to get controllable changes is to set the duration of the spell to Concentration, and then enhance the effect so that the bond maintains concentration. To change the familiar into a human, the effect is Muto Animal with a Corpus requisite, and the base level is 10. Add one magnitude each for Touch range and Concentration duration, and five levels for the item to maintain Concentration. The final level is 25, if the transformation can be done once per day. The level required to transform the maga into the form of her familiar varies. Both can also take on other forms, if the appropriate powers are invested.

Shared Senses: Looking through the other's eyes or hearing through their ears is an Intellego Mentem effect. The base level to share a single sense is five (by analogy from the guidelines), plus five for Touch range and five for Concentration duration. Another five levels lets the bond maintain the effect, for a total level of 20 if the sense can be shared once per day. Note that this sharing works only in one direction, a second power must be instilled for mutual sharing to be possible.

Location: The base level to find the partner is 3, which needs to be increased by one magnitude, to 4, for Touch range. This is Intellego Corpus to find the maga, and Intellego Animal to find the familiar.

Aura of Fire: Wreath the maga or familiar in flames, which do not burn her but do burn anything that comes within them. This is creating flame in an unnatural shape, so the fire does damage equal to its level. The Arts are Creo Ignem, with a Rego requisite. +5 levels to raise the duration to Diameter, +5 levels for range Touch, +5 for the Rego requisite, and +10 for unlimited uses. Final level is damage + 25.

Razor-sharp steel claws: The Arts are Muto Animal (for the familiar) or Muto Corpus (for the maga), with a Terram requisite. The Muto Animal base level would be 3, and the Muto Corpus would be 2 or 3, so the base level is 5, to create base metal. Add five levels for range Touch, and ten total for Concentration duration and concentration maintained by the bond. Because the claws are supposed to be magically sharp, the level is raised by five. Add ten levels so that the effect can be invoked at will, for a final level of 35.

<span id="the-participation-of-other-players"></span>
== The Participation of Other Players ==

The storyguide plays an important role in the creation of your familiar. If your troupe has someone who acts as storyguide for laboratory activities, that person may act as storyguide while you are creating your familiar. However, you may wish to use the whole troupe as the acting storyguide during this process, both to get more creative input and to make the familiar more acceptable to your fellow players, who may find it a challenge to deal with such a strange addition to the company.

Because you and your familiar are so close, you may roleplay your familiar as an extension of your character. After all, you may have similar abilities and personality quirks. However, you may also have another player act as your familiar. This alternative assures that your familiar is at least distinct from you, and is advised if you and your familiar don't get along very well.

<span id="apprentices-1"></span>
== Apprentices ==

n your pursuit of the art of magic, you are likely to want an apprentice. Though the Code of Hermes requires that you devote a season a year to

teaching your apprentice rather than doing research, the apprentice in turn is required to help you do your lab work. In addition, an apprentice provides you close human companionship and the chance to leave a living legacy when you die. Your apprentice will likely be the closest thing to a son or daughter that you, as a magus, will ever have.

<span id="finding-your-apprentice"></span>
== Finding Your Apprentice ==

Among the common people there sometimes appear rare individuals with The Gift — those who have innate magical power. Only these individuals can become apprentices and eventually magi. Luckily for those magi who seek them, these people inevitably stand out from the crowd. Most potential apprentices somehow attract supernatural attention to themselves. In many populations there is a youth who is prone to wandering alone at night, who is the subject of much town gossip, and who displays a precocious wit. Chances are that such a person is a potential apprentice.

Searching for an apprentice can lead to good storytelling and roleplaying possibilities, especially if the search is complicated by enemy forces or uncooperative members of the child's family. However, if you do not wish to make a story out of finding an apprentice, you may determine the results of the search with a die roll. For every season you spend searching for a potential apprentice, make a stress die and add your Perception. If the result is 9+, you find one. If you botch, you may think you've found a child fit to be an apprentice but are somehow duped, either by the child or by some power that replaces your child with

Your student should normally be at least seven years old, as younger children rarely have the ability to start Hermetic training. It is rare for Hermetic apprentices to be older than twenty when they are taken, but it

does happen. Most Gifted people have learned other supernatural abilities by that age, making it difficult to train them (see page 270, below).

Being taken away by a magus to parts unknown is normally disturbing and frightening to a new apprentice, even to one excited or relieved to be free of a miserable living situation. Some children chosen for apprenticeship are kidnapped by their masters, some are coaxed away with promises of knowledge and power, while others are actually offered (or sold) to magi by families who cannot handle the youngsters' strange ways. Though most children chosen to be apprentices come willingly and freely, the Code of Hermes does not require that they do. Strictly speaking, magi are allowed to obtain apprentices in whatever manner they wish.

<span id="training-your-apprentice"></span>
== Training Your Apprentice ==

Once you have your apprentice, the training begins. The Peripheral Code contains a substantial number of rulings on the relationship between a magus and his apprentice. A magus claims an apprentice from the beginning of the season in which he opens the Arts. A magus must personally teach the apprentice for at least one season per year over the course of the apprenticeship, and the season spent opening the Arts counts as the first of these seasons.

A member of House Bonisagus may claim another magus's apprentice at any time, but other members of the Order may not interfere between a master and his apprentice. The apprentice belongs to the master, and may not choose to go to another magus unless his current master fails to give him enough teaching. Harming the apprentice is regarded as a serious attack on the master, and can be punished. Masters who abuse their apprentices are not well-regarded, but it is not against the Code to do so.

A magus may choose to pass an apprentice on to a second magus, provided that both magi agree to the transfer. The apprentice's consent is not required.

Use the rules in the Experience and Advancement section of the Long Term Events chapter to train your apprentice, remembering that you must spend at least one season a year directly teaching. Keep in mind that you should try to impart a broad base of skills — refer to the guidelines in the Character Creation chapter (page 25) to give you an idea of what level of apprentice competence you should be shooting for.

Since an apprentice without a Parma Magica would normally suffer a –3 penalty to all totals due to the effect of The Gift, the Order has ruled that failing to extend your Parma Magica to cover your apprentice during training is a violation of the requirement to train your apprentice properly. If your score in Parma Magica is three or less, it does not give you any bonus to Magic Resistance while shared, but it still deadens the effect of The Gift.

<span id="opening-the-arts-in-louse-ex-miscellanea"></span>
== Opening the Arts in Louse Ex Miscellanea ==

Some Ex Miscellanea traditions rely on an inborn Supernatural Virtue as their Major Virtue. Members of those traditions do not need any minimum Intellego Vim Lab Total to preserve the tradition's Major Virtue when opening the Arts. Other Supernatural Virtues impose the normal minimums.

It is a good idea to have someone else teach the apprentice Latin, and possibly Magic Theory, before you start the apprenticeship, as this makes your apprentice more useful to you. However, until you open the character's Arts he is not your apprentice, and may choose to attach himself to another magus, or may be taken by another magus. Stealing potential apprentices who are obviously intended for magical training is frowned upon, and may be punished, but rescuing Gifted people who are simply being exploited as lab assistants is well-regarded. Indeed, a magus keeping a Gifted character as a simple lab assistant is normally required by a Tribunal to either start training him or to pass him on to a magus who is willing to do so.

While the magus must personally provide the minimum one season per year, he may have others teach the apprentice in other seasons, or allow the apprentice to study from books. Most magi do allow their apprentices some extra study, as it is rare for a magus to spend fifteen years without studying the Arts from a book, and apprentices are no help with those activities.

<span id="opening-the-arts"></span>
== Opening the Arts ==

One of your seasons of teaching must be spent training the apprentice in the basics of Hermetic magic, and you can teach nothing else in that season. Thus, in this season the apprentice gains a score of 0 in all fifteen Hermetic Arts, but learns nothing else. This is referred to as 'opening the Arts'.

If you have a score of less than five in any Art when you open them, your apprentice automatically has a Deficiency (see pages 125 and 272) in that Art. Giving an apprentice Deficiencies in this way is normally treated as a Low Crime by the Tribunals of the Order, and attracts a great deal of social stigma. As a result, few magi train an apprentice until they have a score of five or higher in all Arts. (Note that this is far from the only way that an apprentice can gain a Deficiency, and most of the other ways are not under the master's control.

and thus not Low Crimes.) You may teach Magic Theory before opening the Arts, but you may not teach Arts or spells.

If your apprentice already has some non-Hermetic Supernatural Ability, you can only open the Arts if your Intellego Vim Lab Total equals or exceeds five times the apprentice's score in the relevant Ability, and is at least 10 if the Ability normally derives from a Minor Virtue, or at least 30 if it normally derives from a Major Virtue. For supernatural powers without a linked Ability, you need a Lab Total of 10 for Minor Virtues and 30 for Major ones. If the apprentice has multiple Supernatural Abilities, add all the levels together to determine whether you can open the Arts.

If your Intellego Vim Lab Total merely equals or exceeds the level, the Supernatural Abilities are lost. If your Lab Total is at least double the required level, you may either preserve the Ability, or convert it into a Hermetic Virtue. The choice is the parens' decision. The Virtue should be a Major Virtue if the original Ability was, and Minor likewise. If converted, Supernatural Abilities must normally change into Hermetic Virtues that the parens possesses. This is similar to teaching the apprentice Hermetic Virtues (see later); only Hermetic Virtues possessed by the magus can be passed on, either through teaching or converting. While the parens need not know how to perform the Supernatural Ability, he must know how to perform the Hermetic Virtue. Alternatively, the parens may convert a Supernatural Virtue into a Hermetic Virtue he does not know, if the two Virtues are very similar. For example, Skinchanger might convert into a Minor Magical Focus with self-transformation or with the type of animal the apprentice could change into, or Magic Sensitivity into an Affinity with Intellego or Vim. In this case, the Supernatural Virtue was a feature of the child's Gift, and the parens merely turns that feature into a new, Hermetic channel. Neither the parens nor the child knows what this channel is, and the child is likely to believe that the ability has been simply lost. The troupe should decide whether two Virtues are sufficiently similar. If the apprentice has multiple Supernatural Abilities, you may save some and lose others, but you cannot open the Arts unless your Intellego Vim Lab Total exceeds the level determined by all the Abilities.

Once the Arts are Opened, the apprentice character has a 0 in each of the five Techniques and ten Forms. She can immediately cast spontaneous spells. She can read any casting tablets the covenant may have, providing she has a score of 1 in Artes Liberales and 4 in Latin. Barring some logical limitations — the apprentice can't cast Formulaic spells because she doesn't know any — an apprentice can undertake any magical activity a magus can. Simply use the applicable formula based on the current Arts scores of the apprentice for any magical activity she undertakes.

<span id="teaching-hermetic-virtues"></span>
== Teaching Hermetic Virtues ==

Teaching a Hermetic Virtue combines aspects of learning a Supernatural Ability (page 159) with learning a Mystery Cult Virtue (page 387). The instructor, typically an apprentice's parens, generates a Teaching Source Quality total that is compared to a required target level. Both teacher and student must be Gifted individuals trained in Hermetic Magic Theory. A magus cannot teach a Gifted hedge wizard a Hermetic Virtue because the two men do not understand magic in the same way. At the end of a season's instruction, the parens generates a Teaching Source Quality just as if he were teaching an Ability or an Art.

<span id="teaching-source-quality-communication--teaching--3--bonus"></span>
== TEACHING SOURCE QUALITY: Communication + Teaching + 3 + bonus ==

The bonuses for the Instruction Total are the same bonuses that apply for every teacher (page 378). Like Arts, Hermetic Virtues can only be taught one-on-one, so every parens' Teaching Source Quality receives a +6 bonus. Virtues that affect teaching also apply.

An additional bonus can be included if the teacher includes a Hermetic Flaw along with the Hermetic Virtue. Mystery Cult initiations sometimes include Ordeals, which add a bonus to learning the Mystery Cult Virtue. In its roughest sense, an Ordeal is a Flaw. For whatever reason — magic being quixotic at its core — it is easier to teach a Hermetic Virtue if one includes a Hermetic Flaw. Including a Minor Hermetic Flaw adds a +3 bonus. Including a Major Hermetic Flaw adds a +9 bonus. A teacher can only include a Hermetic Flaw that he has.

Like Mystery Initiations and regular teaching, there is no die roll. The Hermetic Virtue is taught in a single season if the Teaching Source Quality meets or exceeds the Target Level.

Teaching a Minor Hermetic Virtue: Target level is 15

TEACHING A MAJOR HERMETIC VIRTUE: Target Level is 21

The more Hermetic Virtues a Gifted student has, the harder it is to teach him new Hermetic Virtues. Learning Supernatural Abilities is also hindered by knowledge possessed in other Supernatural Abilities, and Hermetic theorists speculate that whatever nuance of The Gift so limits learning Supernatural Abilities also limits learning Hermetic Virtues through instruction. Each Minor Hermetic Virtue the character already possesses adds +3 to the Target Level, and each Major Hermetic Virtue adds +9.

A teacher can only teach a Hermetic Virtue that he has. If he decides to include a Hermetic Flaw in the instruction, to make the process

easier, he can only include a Hermetic Flaw that he possesses. The student cannot instruct himself, another difference between learning Hermetic Virtues and Mystery Cult Virtues. Not every magus teaches Hermetic Virtues to his apprentice, although doing so does fulfill the annual requirement of one season of personal instruction due the apprentice. If a magus would rather teach Hermetic Virtues than Arts or Abilities, the apprentice may end up with less knowledge (fewer experience points) than his peers. Like most of apprenticeship, it is the parens' decision. It isn't unusual for a parens to teach Arts, Abilities, and spells during the required seasons of instruction, and spend additional seasons teaching the apprentice a Hermetic Virtue or two.

Training is not the only source of Hermetic Virtues; some Gifted individuals have Gifts that are naturally apt for certain areas of Hermetic magic. In game terms, they take the Hermetic Virtue before training.

<span id="acquiring-house-virtues"></span>
=== Acquiring house Virtues ===

Every Hermetic House has one or more Virtues associated with it, and every Hermetic magus receives a free Minor Virtue based on his House. Players often refer to this Virtue as the &quot;House Virtue,&quot; because it comes free with the character's Hermetic House. The House Virtue does not have to be specifically taught, although it can be. Often it is learned over time, assumed by the impressionable young apprentice as she learns magic during the prolonged teaching and laboratory interactions with her parens.

For over half of the Houses, it takes 10 seasons of one-to-one interactions with a parens for an apprentice to gain the free Minor House Virtue. Teaching Arts, Arcane Abilities, and spells and helping in the laboratory all count as seasons of one-to-one interactions. If an apprentice does not receive 10 seasons of one-to-one interaction, he does not receive the free House Virtue. In such a case, there would likely be other problems due to legal issues.

Acquiring the Minor Hermetic House Virtue: Requires 10 Seasons of one-to-one Interaction with Parens

This rule pertains to seven of the twelve Houses: all four True Lineages, and three of the Societates. The fourth Societas, House Ex Miscellanea, is a special case because an apprentice of a House Ex Miscellanea magus receives a package of House Virtues and Flaws: one Minor Hermetic Virtue, one Major non-Hermetic Virtue, and one Major Hermetic Flaw. Because there are several types of Ex Miscellanea magi, the troupe should decide if an apprentice of a specific tradition learns the House Virtues and Flaws

through one-on-one association or through a process similar to a Mystery Initiation like the Mystery Cult Houses.

An apprentice of a magus of a Mystery Cult gains the free House Virtue by undergoing an Initiation to learn the House's Outer Mystery. House Verditius Initiates an apprentice immediately following the opening of an apprentice's Arts. House Bjornaer Initiates an apprentice's Heartbeast at some point during apprenticeship, at the Ritual of Twelve Years (see Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, page 16). Houses Criamon and Merinita Initiate apprentices at various times, usually dependent on the master. Initiation into a House's Outer Mystery takes a season.

The apprentice must learn the same free House Virtue that his parens knows. In a House where there is a choice of House Virtues, the parens can decide which House Virtue is acquired, if he has both. House Flambeau, for example, has the choice of Puissant Perdo or Puissant Ignem. If the master has both Virtues, he can choose either as the apprentice's House Virtue.

<span id="gaining-hermetic-plaws"></span>
=== Gaining Hermetic Plaws ===

Few apprentices purposefully gain Hermetic Flaws. A player can always select a Hermetic Flaw at character generation, and while this will develop sometime during the child character's life, that is different from gaining a Hermetic Flaw after creating the character. Hermetic Flaws acquired after character generation affect a character as soon as they are gained, their effects manifesting immediately. Hermetic magi have not found a way to remove Hermetic Flaws, and once gained a Hermetic Flaw is permanent, barring a story.

The two most common ways characters gain Hermetic Flaws are through learning Hermetic Virtues, and as a consequence of game play. As mentioned previously, it is easier to learn a Hermetic Virtue from a teacher if that teacher includes a Hermetic Flaw in the process. Hermetic magi do not fully understand why this is so, but like Mystery Cult Initiations, tainting the learning process with an incurred liability makes instruction easier. The second way characters gain Hermetic Flaws is through play. Uncontrolled Temporary Twilight episodes are a frequent cause, bestowing Hermetic Flaws on an apprentice in the same way they grant Hermetic Flaws to a magus (page 230). Gaining a Hermetic Deficiency Flaw during the opening of the Arts is another path to receiving a new Flaw during play. Some Supernatural creatures have the power to grant Minor and Major Flaws, and while these aren't always Hermetic, they can be. These Flaws are not necessarily permanent and many are temporary inconveniences. Realms of Power: Madic and Realms of Power: Faerie have details and example creatures.

<span id="pleshing-out-your-apprentice"></span>
== Pleshing Out Your Apprentice ==

The basic benefit that an apprentice provides you is the addition of his Intelligence and Magic Theory scores to your Lab Totals (see page 264). If all you want is a lab assistant, you only need to keep track of your apprentice's Intelligence and Magic Theory scores, and after fifteen years, your apprentice becomes a full magus and leaves your service.

However, if created as a full character, an apprentice can be developed as the saga progresses into both a very important companion to your magus and a valuable member of the covenant. To create your apprentice as a character, determine Characteristics, Virtues and Flaws, and Abilities for a character of young age. Make sure that the character has The Gift, otherwise he cannot be taught Hermetic magic, and consider carefully whether to take any other supernatural abilities. Make sure that your magus can open the apprentice's Arts. Choose Abilities that the character learned in his childhood. As the saga progresses, update the apprentice's Abilities, magical Arts, spells known, and other statistics as you train him, just as you would those of any other character.

<span id="the-apprentice-in-play"></span>
== The Apprentice in Play ==

A fully developed apprentice makes a playable character. If you want to play an apprentice, keep in mind that you have no natural niche in the story. Grogs fight, companions provide skilled assistance, and magi have powerful spells. As an apprentice you are outclassed in all areas. Nevertheless, some stories are made exciting by an apprentice character or characters, as apprentices are interesting individuals, especially if there's no magus around to overshadow the apprentice's magic with his own. The ''Apprentices'' sourcebook covers these sorts of stories in much more detail, and gives more information on child characters.

When you are a magus and teacher, some of the best roleplaying opportunities for your apprentice arise when he is interacting with you. To encourage this, you may want to let another player roleplay your apprentice, or you may consider your apprentice a troupe character to be played by different members of the troupe at different times, much as a grog is (see Troupe Style Play on page 528).

<span id="the-end-of-apprenticeship"></span>
== The End of Apprenticeship ==

Apprenticeship ends with the 'apprentice's gauntlet', which is normally administered after fifteen years. This is set by the parens, and is intended to demonstrate that the apprentice is worthy to become a full magus. If the apprentice fails the gauntlet, he remains an apprentice, traditionally for another year.

If an apprentice fails three gauntlets, the Quaesitores set the fourth and subsequent gauntlets, to ensure that the parens is not setting impossible gauntlets simply to retain the apprentice's services. An apprentice who fails Quaesitorial gauntlets repeatedly will carry a reputation for incompetence with him if he ever does pass, but there is no other consequence. The Quaesitores do tend to set easier gauntlets than most parentes, testing basic competence only, so even those apprentices trained by Incomprehensible masters can normally pass.

<span id="arcane-experimentation"></span>
== Arcane '''Experimentation''' ==

he preceding rules assume that you are being careful with your laboratory work and staying a safely within the bounds of what you know how to do. If you

wish, however, you can test your limits and experiment with new and possibly dangerous techniques. You can experiment when inventing a spell, creating any magical enchantment (device or familiar), or investigating an enchantment. In any case, you have the chance to perform feats that are normally beyond your capabilities, but you also run the risk of failing utterly, perhaps dangerously.

<span id="the-experimental-premise"></span>
== The Experimental Premise ==

At the beginning of each season, consider the project you're working on and decide whether you want to experiment on it. If you want to work from and benefit from a Laboratory Text, you cannot experiment, because you must follow the Laboratory Text precisely. If you do experiment, add a simple die roll to your Lab Total. This bonus represents the fruits of the risks you take. However, you must also roll a stress die on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart&quot; for each season that the project involves. If you experiment over multiple seasons, inventing the same spell or instilling the same power in a device, the chart results for each season accumulate and apply to the whole project. For example, if it takes two seasons to invest a power into your staff, you have to make a roll on the chart each season. Both results affect the staff or the power you're investing into it.

<span id="exceptional-risk"></span>
== Exceptional Risk ==

You may choose to push your limits even further, adding from +1 to +3 (your choice) to the die roll; this bonus is called your risk modifier. When you do this, you must add the risk modifier to all your rolls on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart,&quot; and you get a number of extra botch dice on your rolls equal to your bonus.

<span id="extraordinary-results"></span>
== Extraordinary Results ==

Some of the results listed on the &quot;Extraordinary Result Chart&quot; require some interpretation. When interpreting these results, consider the magus's sigil, specialties, and weaknesses. Also take into account the type of spell or power being worked on, and the

Laws of Magic. The more aspects of magic that you bring together, the more interesting the result is. The level of the effect is not changed by any extraordinary result, nor does it gain any requisites. This may result in a spell or effect that is more or less powerful than a conventional Hermetic effect of its

When referring to the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart,&quot; roll a stress die, adding your risk modifier (if any). If you roll a 0, roll one botch die, plus a number of botch dice equal to your risk modifier. You also get one additional botch die for each point in the supernatural aura of the laboratory, even it would not normally grant you extra botch dice (such as a Magic aura for magi).

If your creation comes out flawed or difficult to use because of your roll on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart,&quot; you have two choices: live with the anomaly, or recreate the effect. If you recreate it, use the normal laboratory rules. However, you gain your Magic Theory score (your score at the time of your experiment) as a bonus to your Lab Total to accomplish the invention, having learned something from your nearly successful experiment. Thus, your Magic Theory score is applied twice to your Lab Total. The recreation process must occur in another season, and you need not experiment then. While this may often be a good option for spells, the additional costs for enchanted items make it less appealing there, and magi are more likely to choose to live with flaws, even quite serious ones.

<span id="inventing-a-spell-by-experimentation"></span>
== Inventing a Spell by Experimentation ==

Points from the simple die, added to your Lab Total, might let you finish a spell sooner, or even invent a spell that is otherwise beyond your capacity. If even with the added simple die your Lab Total is still lower than the spell's level, you cannot invent the spell, and must still make a roll on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart.&quot; Even though your experiment fails, it can still blow up in your face. Having failed to invent the spell, you may try again next season, and may experiment again. You do not gain your Magic Theory score as a bonus, however, as you did not nearly succeed.

<span id="enchanted-items-oreated-by-experimentation"></span>
== '''Enchanted Items Oreated''' by Experimentation ==

Even with the added bonus of a simple die, your Lab Total may not meet the level of the effect you're investing. In that case, you lose all the vis involved and must still roll on the &quot;Extraordinary Effects Chart.&quot; You may try again next season, though, and may experiment again.

If your Lab Total is high enough to invest an effect, but the effect turns out to be flawed (as determined by a roll on the chart), it still &quot;takes

up space&quot; in your device, just like a normal effect. Thus, if you risk experimentation and make a mistake, you can permanently limit the effectiveness of your magical item.

<span id="anchanting-a-pamiliar-by-axperimentation"></span>
== Anchanting a Pamiliar by Axperimentation ==

A magus would have to be insane to enchant his familiar by experimentation, as a mistake in any season of binding or instilling powers could taint the deepest bond he has. Still, some magi are insane. Experimenting on this activity adds to the Lab Total as normal.

<span id="experimenting-on-longevity-rituals"></span>
== Experimenting on Longevity Rituals ==

You may experiment on Longevity Rituals, adding the simple die to your Lab Total. This bonus increases the potency of your ritual, giving you greater resilience against the effects of aging. If your ritual is flawed by a roll on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart,&quot; you may create a second ritual, which over-rides the effects of the flawed ritual, but this takes an additional season.

<span id="investigating-an-enchanted-item-by-experimentation"></span>
== Investigating an Enchanted Item by Experimentation ==

The simple die is added to every roll made to discover an item's invested powers. If you cannot bring your Lab Total high enough to discover an item's powers, you still have to roll on the &quot;Extraordinary Results Chart,&quot; though.

When investigating an enchanted item by experimenting on it, you take risks not normally taken, and may damage or destroy the magic item in the process. Any results from the chart indicating damage or changes to the project you are working on are applied to the magic item or one of its powers. It's possible, though, that a magic item's own protections can preserve it from the dangers of your experiments. If the level of an item's protecting power (like Magic Resistance or an appropriate spell) exceeds your Lab Total (including any bonus for experimentation), the item resists any damaging effects rolled on the chart.

Disaster: You fail miserably. Consult the following table for the result, depending on the number of zeroes rolled on the botch dice. Suffer the effect for the number you roll and for all lower numbers, unless explicitly told otherwise.

The season is completely wasted; see Complete Failure.

* 9 The spell has a major side benefit. For example, a spell that transforms you into a wolf also lets you speak to all beasts while a wolf.
* 10 The spell has a fatal flaw. For example, an invisibility spell makes you glow.

No Benefit: Your experimentation produces no results. You lose the benefit of the extra die and risk modifier — recalculate your Lab Total without those modifiers. If your new Lab Total is too low to succeed in the project, it must be abandoned.

Complete Failure: You get nothing from your efforts, and your season is wasted. If you were working on a familiar or enchanted item, roll a simple die. On a 0, it is destroyed.

'''Special or Story Event:''' The storyguide picks one of the following.

The creation requires additional raw vis. The magus must spend a number of additional pawns of vis that match the Technique or Form of the project equal to the magnitude of the effect (including modifications) plus the risk modifier. If he is unable to do so, either because he does not have the vis, or because he cannot handle enough vis in a single season, treat as a Complete Failure.

The magus also creates a spell, with the same Technique and Form as the project, of any level that he could create in a single season. The spell is designed by the storyguide or troupe, and need not have an

obvious connection to the project. The magus knows it, and can write up the Laboratory Text as normal, allowing other magi to create it as well. It is simpler if this spell does follow all the rules of Hermetic Magic, but that is not essential if the troupe is happy with the complications. Treat this as No Extraordinary Effects for the main project.

The creation is modified in some way that does not necessarily fall under the categories of Side Effect or Modified Effect, although it may if desired. This allows the storyguide to introduce any sort of supernatural effect — the creation could even be strongly affected by a different realm. The result may be positive or negative from the magus's perspective, but should be interesting for the troupe.

A story event happens. This can be anything, it could be used as an opportunity to introduce a major plot line, or as a brief and amusing distraction. It does not need to happen immediately, the uncontrolled magic might set something in motion, or it might be a result of using the creation in a particular context, some time later. The story event may be basically positive — the magus might attract the attention of a potential familiar, for example. Unless the story event requires otherwise, treat this as No Extraordinary Effects for the project itself.

Discovery: Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier. If you are engaged in Arcane Discovery (see page 277), you make a discovery that advances your project, and ignore this table.

<span id="arcane-discovery"></span>
== Arcane Discovery ==

possibilities of Hermetic magic through their own discoveries. It did not spring, perfect, from the brow of Bonisagus, and it has

been developed and expanded since. The most famous examples are probably the development of the Aegis of the Hearth by Notatus of Bonisagus, the first Primus of that House, and the expansion of Vim magic to the Divine, Infernal, and Faerie realms by Conciatta of Bonisagus in the tenth century. (For more details on Conciatta, see Legends of Hermes.) Player characters may also attempt to expand Hermetic magic in this way, and while the immediate benefits of power are less than those of other laboratory projects, the gain in prestige may be far greater.

<span id="the-breakthrough"></span>
== The Breakthrough ==

To achieve an arcane discovery, you must accumulate a number of '''breakthrough points''' determined by the type of Breakthrough your magus is attempting. There are three kinds of Breakthrough: '''Minor''', '''Major''' and '''Hermetic'''. Note that it is recommended that the exact number of breakthrough points required may be varied, so the players do not know the precise number needed for the Breakthrough.

A Minor Breakthrough is a development that is immediately useful and applicable in the existing framework of Hermetic magic, such as a new Range, Target or Duration. It improves upon or adds to existing theory without truly reaching the limits of magic. A Minor Breakthrough typically requires around 30 breakthrough points. In many sagas, Minor Breakthroughs happen easily enough that a maga can expect to achieve this goal once or twice during her lifetime. Minor Breakthroughs could be more common, but are few because most magi Bonisagi have loftier goals. Why invent a new Range when you can attempt to break a Hermetic Limit? Grandiosity usually propels magi toward harder projects.

A Major Breakthrough pushes those limits, but does not break them; these include Hermetic Virtues for Gifted characters. Incorporating hedge magic into Hermetic theory is a Major Breakthrough, and the incorporation can then be taught to others as Supernatural Virtues. A Major Breakthrough typically requires around 45 breakthrough points. Notatus' development of the Aegis of the Hearth was a Major Breakthrough, a variable spell based on Bonisagus' Parma Magica. Major Breakthroughs make a magus famous. With persistence, a troupe playing in a fast saga could realistically see a player make a Major Breakthrough.

A Hermetic Breakthrough is research that breaks one of the Lesser Limits of Magic, for example a new Arcane Ability or the ability to cast permanent duration spells without vis. Hermetic Breakthroughs re-write the theory books; the only Hermetic Breakthrough in 450 years was the development of the Parma Magica by Bonisagus, which broke the Lesser Limit of Magic Resistance, a limit that still binds all known forms of non-Hermetic magic. A Hermetic Breakthrough typically requires around 60 breakthrough points.

A Breakthrough may be something entirely new, born from the imagination of a creative maga. It may also be based on a form of non-Hermetic magic, as a magus tries to make it possible for Hermetic magi to do something that non-Hermetic wizards do. In either case, the researcher may accumulate breakthrough points through experimentation, as described later. In the latter case, the magus may also study the non-Hermetic magic, seeking insights into its nature and applying them to Hermetic magic. Both of these approaches yield breakthrough points, and points from both sources may be mixed in a single project.

In either case, the troupe must define the result of the research in advance and agree on the level of Breakthrough. Success will change the saga, and so it is important that the whole troupe is happy with those changes. Ancient Magic and Hedge Magic Revised Edition contain a large number of suggested Breakthroughs that would allow a magus to incorporate certain aspects of non-

Hermetic magic into Hermetic theory. These can also serve as inspiration for Breakthroughs that are not linked to any existing tradition.

<span id="experimentation"></span>
== '''Experimentation''' ==

Once you have determined what sort of Breakthrough you would like to accomplish, you must invent something Hermetically that somehow incorporates your idea. This can be a spell or a magical enchantment, either a lesser enchantment or a charged item. Detail the effect fully, as per the normal rules. Since you are searching for clues aimed at surpassing regular Hermetic theories, you must experiment, using the rules found in the Arcane Experimentation section earlier, including choosing a risk modifier for your experiment and rolling on the Extraordinary Results Chart.

For your original research to be fruitful you must roll the Discovery result on the Extraordinary Results Chart. Fortune plays a large roll in the research process. However, you can hedge your bet with original research in a way that you can not with regular experimentation. Instead of adding your risk modifier into your Lab Total during the season, you use that modifier to adjust your roll on the Extraordinary Results Chart. The risk modifier still runs the range of +1 to +3, but you are restricted in your choice by your Magic Theory score. For every five points or fraction

thereof of Magic Theory (including Puissant Magic Theory) you may choose a risk modifier of 1. Thus, to chose a risk modifier of +2 your Magic Theory must be 6 or higher, and a risk modifier of +3 requires a Magic Theory of 11+.

<span id="risk-modifier-1-per-5-points-of-magic-theory-or-fraction-thereof-up-to-3"></span>
==== RISK MODIFIER: +1 per 5 points of Magic Theory or fraction thereof, up to +3 ====

Consult the Extraordinary Results Chart as normal to determine the effect on your spell, including adding your Risk Modifier. However, you may also add or subtract all or part of your Risk Modifier in order to get a Discovery in addition to the normal effect of experimentation. Thus, if you had a Risk Modifier of +3, and rolled an 8, you would get a Modified Effect (from a total of 11). You could also subtract 1 to get a Discovery in addition. The effect of the spell is still modified. You cannot use the Risk Modifier to get a supplementary result other than a Discovery.

<span id="breakthrough"></span>
==== Breakthrough: ====

Roll Discovery on the Extraordinary Results Chart during a season of Arcane Experimentation

<span id="risk-modifier"></span>
==== RISK MODIFIER: ====

Do not add risk modifier into Lab Total. Add or Subtract up to risk modifier again from the stress die rolled on the Extraordinary Results Chart

You are hoping for a Discovery. If you do not roll a Discovery, your spell or item is still affected by the Extraordinary Results Chart. Most likely you will end up with a slightly odd Hermetic effect. If your original research involved a spell and that spell is flawed or difficult to cast, you may reinvent the spell using the rules found in the Arcane Experimentation section. If your research involved an item and that item is flawed, you may attempt to reinvent that item, but all vis used in the initial experiment is lost.

If your spell or enchanted item research takes more than a single season to complete you must continue to roll on the Extraordinary Results Chart for each season. Having deciding how you will use your Risk Modifier in a previous season, you must continue to use it in the same manner for consecutive seasons. If you subtracted 1 from your initial roll on the Extraordinary Results Chart in your first season, for example, you must subtract 1 from every additional roll on the Extraordinary Results Chart in additional seasons until the item or spell is completed. You may accrue odd and weird results as your research progresses, but may continue to experiment providing you don't receive a Complete Failure or Disaster result.

If you do achieve a Discovery during your experimentation then the original research was a success. Ignore the Discovery sub-chart of the Extraordinary Results Chart; that chart applies to those not investigating the deeper mystery of Hermetic magic, instead discovering something more intimate about their personal connection to magic and the Arts. You, however, have found that elusive element of magic that you started your original research searching for. Now you must stabilize that experimental process to better understand your discovery.

Each spell or magical enchantment can only lead to one discovery. You may repeatedly invent the same spell or enchantment experiment until a discovery is rolled, even if the experiment was a success. Thus, you may accumulate many usable versions of the same spell in process of your research. However, once a specific experiment yields a Discovery, you may no longer explore that spell or magical enchantment for further discoveries.

<span id="stabilizing-the-unknown"></span>
== Stabilizing The Unknown ==

After you have achieved your Discovery, you must stabilize that process through exact repetition. You must repeat the experimentation, continuing for the same number of seasons and using the exact Lab Total and risk modifier that you used to find your Discovery. If you used vis during your process you must repeat the amount used. You must roll again on the Extraordinary Results Chart, and you must modify your roll in the same direction as you did to make the Discovery. This means that if you added

your risk modifier to your roll your must add it again, if you subtracted your risk modifier from your roll you must subtract it this second time.

During the stabilization season you do not need to roll a Discovery to succeed. As long as you do not roll a harmful effect (Disaster, No Benefit, Complete Failure) you stabilize your discovery. Ignore any beneficial result you might roll. If you do roll a harmful effect your stabilization process fails, although you may try again in a subsequent season.

If your stabilization season succeeds, you gain one breakthrough point per magnitude of the invented Hermetic spell or enchanted item. You also create a Laboratory Text that explains your discovery.

<span id="successful-stabilization-season-magnitudes-of-stabilized-discovery--breakthrough-points"></span>
== Successful Stabilization Season Magnitudes of Stabilized Discovery = Breakthrough Points ==

As a side effect to this stabilization process, you receive Warping Points from your attempts to understand this new magic. The number of Warping Points gained is the magnitude of the effect minus a simple die. If you gain 2 or more Warping Points you must roll to avoid Wizard's Twilight (page 228). You can obviously mitigate the chance of gaining Warping Points by experimenting with lower magnitude effects. However, this lengthens your original research process, since it is your accumulated effect magnitudes that ultimately add up to your Breakthrough. Experimenting with higher magnitude spells hastens you toward your Breakthrough and increases your risk of Wizard's Twilight.

<span id="warping-points-gained-the-magnitude-of-the-stabilized-discovery--a-simple-die"></span>
== Warping Points Gained: The magnitude of the Stabilized Discovery — a simple die ==

You receive Warping Points whether you succeed or fail at stabilizing your discovery. If your stabilization attempt fails, you may spend another season and try it again. You may continue to stabilize your discovery until you succeed, providing you spend consecutive seasons until you succeed and you do not suffer some dire event along the way.

<span id="integration"></span>
== Integration ==

Insight can also be gained from studying some feature of a non-Hermetic magical practice. Every insight the magus gains allows him to produce a partially Hermetic effect incorporating some aspect of the magic in question. As he produces more of these effects, he gains the broader understanding necessary to incorporate that aspect into Hermetic theory as a whole.

The seasons spent gaining insight produce Laboratory Texts. Any magus may study these

Laboratory Texts over the course of a season in order to gain the same insight for himself, even without direct access to the artifacts. Summaries of Laboratory Texts are not useful in this way, however, only the whole thing can be used. For purposes of copying, insight Laboratory Texts have a level equal to the typical number of breakthrough points needed for the type of Breakthrough in question.

There are three sources of insight: texts, relics and teachers.

Texts are books and tomes, symbolic wall paintings, or other explanatory sources which describe how to learn, perform or cast a magical effect. If the text contains the information needed to improve a Supernatural Ability, a character who already had the Ability could use it, as per the normal rules. Most Hermetic magi however, do not have other Supernatural Abilities. Alternatively, the text may contain the rites and practices needed to perform a magical spell or ritual associated with an ancient magical tradition.

Relics are the mystical devices or sacred items enchanted by practitioners of the tradition, and incorporating unique aspects of that tradition. Additionally, a relic may be an on-going mystical effect caused by the magical tradition. Like Hermetic magical devices, a magus is able to investigate the device to learn its secrets and unlock the methods used to craft it.

Teachers are individuals who possess the Supernatural Abilities associated with the ancient magic and are able and willing to instruct a Hermetic magus. For contemporary traditions of non-Hermetic magic, such individuals are relatively accessible, although close collaboration with a &quot;hedge wizard&quot; might harm a maga's reputation. The ghosts of practitioners of extinct traditions may remain in Mythic Europe, and might be convinced to teach a maga.

For every season a magus spends investigating a source of insight, make a stress roll of Intelligence + Magic Theory against an Ease Factor of 18. Inventive Genius adds three to this roll, and some sources of insight may add their own modifiers. If the roll succeeds, the magus gains an insight. If it fails, he learns nothing now, but may try again in another season. He may do other things before returning to his study. On a botch, the magus thinks he has an insight, but does not. He realizes this if he creates an effect, as described below, in an attempt to use the insight, the final product is entirely Hermetic, or simply non-functional.

A single source can generally only provide a single insight, although there may be rare exceptions. The same source provides the same insight for any magus who studies it.

<span id="creating-the-effect"></span>
== Creating the Effect ==

A particular insight allows the researcher to create one, specified effect. This effect might be a spell, or an effect enchanted into an item. It could, conceivably, be another laboratory project; anything that uses a Lab Total and creates something. However, spells are by far the most common, followed by item enchantments. The magus must experiment while creating the effect, as he is most certainly stretching the boundaries of Hermetic magic.

The researcher does not get to choose the effect for which he receives insight, and as the level of the effect is fixed, the insight might be for an effect he cannot yet invent. For example, the effect might be level 40, while the researcher has a Lab Total of 32. In that case, the researcher can increase his Lab Total and then work on the effect.

The troupe should decide on the effects that result from particular pieces of insight, choosing ones that advance the saga without upsetting play balance. Player characters can vary things as much as they like once they fully integrate the system, so the restrictions at this stage should be accepted with good grace.

The researcher must invent exactly the effect inspired by the insight. He may not vary the Range, Duration, or Target, or any other parameters. As the magus must experiment while inventing the effect, the result may be slightly different, as a result of rolls on the Extraordinary Results table.

A spell is cast like a normal Formulaic spell, and characters with Flexible Formulaic Magic may vary it at casting time in the normal way. The spell may also be Mastered, again in the normal way.

The effect created may bend or break the limits of magic, as it incorporates non-Hermetic elements. Setting the level of the effect may well require a judgment call by the troupe, as it may do something for which there is no Hermetic guideline.

If the effect is successfully created, the magus gains a number of breakthrough points equal to the magnitude of the effect. This applies even if the final effect is warped or has a side effect. These points are added to the magus's running total, and he must find another source of insight before repeating the procedure.

The effect produced in this way can be reproduced by other Hermetic magi. However, they can only do so if they have access to a Laboratory Text describing it, and it is not possible to vary the effect in any way; it must be reproduced exactly as it was initially created.

Reproducing the effect in this way does not grant breakthrough points unless the reproducing magus also gains the relevant insight, whether from investigating the same item or from reading the original investigator's Laboratory Texts. It is possible to reproduce the effect first, and study the insight Laboratory Texts later.

<span id="after-the-breakthrough"></span>
== After the Breakthrough ==

Minor Breakthroughs are usable immediately in the game, and are understandable by all Hermetic magi. New Ranges or Durations may be incorporated into new spells or items, and the Laboratory Texts distributed for a spell may be used by another Hermetic magus without his needing to research the Breakthrough. Any magus who has created an effect using the Breakthrough can then use that Range or Duration freely in his other spells, and any magus trained by that magus, in either Arts or spells, may also do so.

Major and Hermetic Breakthroughs must be taught to Hermetic magi directly. An Ability may be taught in the usual way, either in person or through books. The discoverer converts his breakthrough points into experience points in the new Ability, so that a magus who accrued 50 breakthrough points to integrate an Ability would start with a score of 4.

A new Virtue may be Initiated according to the normal rules for Mysteries. The discoverer gains the Virtue when he completes the integration, and does not need to be Initiated. He does need to design an Initiation Script, following the rules in the Long-Term Events chapter (page 388). The Virtue can also be taught to an apprentice, following the rules given earlier. In theory, it could be taught to any magus, but the penalties are likely to make that impossible in practice.

A second Major Breakthrough integrates a Major or Hermetic Breakthrough completely into Hermetic magic. If this succeeds, any magus may create an effect using the Breakthrough as long as he has a Lab Text, and then may use the Breakthrough freely. As for Minor Breakthroughs, the same applies to any magus taught Arts or spells by a magus who understands the Breakthrough. Experimentation is always suitable for this second Breakthrough, and integration may be used if there are suitable non-Hermetic traditions to study.

<span id="laboratory-personalization-rules"></span>
== Laboratory Personalization Rules ==

fter settling in to her standard and average laboratory, a young maga will sooner or later start to consider the possibilities of adding a little personal touch and flavor to her

workspace. This will help her to feel a greater sense of identity and comfort with her own lab, but perhaps more importantly, the lab will also become more effective in her preferred areas of research. Needless to say, labs usually grow to become colored according to the personal habits and magical specialties of a magus. A long-established laboratory tells a great deal about its owner, in its features and outfittings, as well as in its cleanliness and orderliness.

In introducing the new statistics for laboratories, it may be helpful to think of the lab as a character in its own right: it has Characteristics, Virtues and Flaws, Specializations (which are analogous to Abilities for human characters), and possibly also Personality Traits.

Each laboratory is characterized by a set of eight Characteristics, with a standard (default) lab starting with scores of 0 in each. Unlike human Characteristics, however, these values are relatively easy to change. Labs with a positive Warping Characteristic also have one or more Personality Traits. Each lab may also have a number of Virtues and Flaws, which may be Major (worth 3 points), Minor (worth 1 point), or Free (0 points), just as for human characters. Certain Virtues and Flaws may grant a lab a small number of Specializations. A Specialization adds its score to any Lab Total with a particular Art or type of activity. For example, a lab might have Specializations Spells 1 and Creo 2.

<span id="laboratory-characteristics"></span>
== Laboratory Characteristics ==

The eight Laboratory Characteristics are as follows:

Size, Refinement, General Quality, Upkeep, Safety, Warping, Health, Aesthetics

Apart from Warping, which cannot be negative, each Characteristic may be positive, negative, or zero. A standard lab starts with all Characteristics at zero.

To determine the Characteristics of a non-standard laboratory, proceed as follows:

<ul>
<li>Select the Size and Refinement scores according to the descriptions of these Characteristics below.</li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Set the Safety to be equal to the Refinement. If the occupied Size (see below) is greater than zero, subtract it from the Safety. Set the scores of the remaining five Characteristics to zero.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>For each of the lab's Virtues and Flaws, apply any adjustments to the Characteristics that they specify.</li></ol></li></ul>

<span id="size-1"></span>
=== Size ===

Size specifies broadly how much floor space is provided by the physical structure of the laboratory. The larger the laboratory is, the more benefits (Virtues) it can accommodate. Thus, each point of Size adds to the maximum permitted number of Virtue points minus Flaw points (see Virtues and Flaws, below).

It is sometimes necessary to use the occupied Size, which might be less than the Size. More often than not, the laboratory is filled to capacity (there is no more room for extra points of Virtues), in which case the occupied Size is

simply equal to the Size. However, if the lab space is not fully used, then the occupied Size is equal to the Size minus the number of free points available for new Virtues. (We will see below that this is exactly the same as the number of points of Virtues minus Flaws, minus the Refinement.) For example, a lab with Size +4 and Refinement 0, and two points of Virtues minus Flaws, has an occupied Size of +2. In this case, the occupied Size is given in parentheses, so for this example, the Size would be written as +4 (+2).

Despite the extra Virtues that they may accommodate, most magi do not opt to have a significantly above-average sized lab. This is because labs with positive Size have two drawbacks:

Firstly, the more a laboratory is expanded, the more unmanageable and dangerous it becomes — it becomes harder to oversee it all, and it takes longer to get around it. Magi can only cope with a certain extent of equipment and outfittings, before they begin to lose track of it all. For this reason, and as stated above, the occupied Size (if positive) subtracts from the lab's base Safety. (Since Refinement has the opposite effect, however, this penalty may be offset by taking a Refinement at least as high as the Size.) There is no Safety benefit to an occupied Size less than zero.

Secondly, it looks slightly ridiculous if a chamber is far larger than it needs to be to accommodate a laboratory. It is not aesthetically pleasing if, for example, all your furniture and equipment squats in the middle of a much larger room, surrounded by an echo chamber of unused space which merely gathers dust and cobwebs. For this reason, for every full two points by which the Size exceeds the occupied Size, you should take

the Empty Flaw. For example, a lab with Size +5 (0) should take the Empty Flaw twice.

|-

| 1500
|}

A lab cannot be smaller than Size –3. However, there is no upper limit; for each additional 500 square feet beyond 1500, add a further +1 to Size.

<span id="befinement"></span>
=== Befinement ===

Refinement is a measure of the expertise and time taken to assemble the contents of the lab efficaciously. The more experienced a maga is, the more efficiently she can make use of the available space. Just like Size, therefore, each point of Refinement adds to the maximum permitted number of Virtue points minus Flaw points (see Virtues and Flaws, below). Highly-refined labs can thus either be smaller than normal, without needing to suffer Flaws, or permit more points of Virtues than would otherwise be possible.

A freshly-assembled lab starts with a Refinement score of 0, unless the assembler has a Magic Theory of less than 3, in which case its Refinement score is equal to her Magic Theory – 3. However, for magi with a Magic Theory of more than 3, the starting Refinement score is always 0, no matter how high their Magic Theory.

The rules for increasing a lab's Refinement are quite straightforward: You need to be familiar with the lab in question (as a rule of thumb, you need to have worked in the lab for a number of years equal to the existing Refinement score) and need a Magic Theory equal to at least the desired Refinement score, plus 3. Increasing the Refinement by one point takes a season of work, during which time the lab's contents are optimized and rearranged. For example, if you have a Magic Theory of 5 and a lab with a Refinement 0, you can spend one season to increase the Refinement to +1, and a further season to increase it to +2.

Such a season of work also gives a chance to gain the Highly Organized and Spotless Virtues or to gain or lose the Hidden Defect Flaw. Make an Intelligence + Magic Theory stress roll. If this meets an Ease Factor of 12, Highly Organized is gained. If this also meets an Ease Factor of 15,

then any existing Hidden Defect Flaw may be spotted and corrected (the Flaw is removed). However if the roll results in a botch, the Hidden Defect Flaw is gained. If you wish, you may also make a Tidy (or other relevant Personality Trait) roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If this succeeds, the Spotless Virtue is gained. See below for the effects of these two Virtues and the Hidden Defect Flaw.

Whenever the Refinement score increases by one, the occupied Size decreases by one, since there is one extra spare point made available for Virtues. Since the base Safety of a lab is equal to Refinement – occupied Size (if positive), whenever the Refinement score increases by one, the net Safety increase is either one point (if the new occupied Size is negative) or two points (otherwise).

For example, Darius (when he has a Magic Theory of 4) spends a season to increase the Refinement of his standard laboratory (with all Characteristics equal to zero, and no Virtues and Flaws) to +1. This causes the occupied Size to drop to -1 and the Safety to increase to +1. There is now free space for one Minor Virtue. If, in the next season, he installs such a Virtue, the occupied Size returns to 0, and the Safety stays at +1. Later on, he has an extension to the chamber constructed, taking its Size to +1 (0), and allowing space for one more Minor Virtue. When he spends a further season to install such a Virtue, the occupied Size increases to +1, and the Safety thus drops to 0. Later still (when Darius has increased his Magic Theory to 5) he spends a further season to increase the Refinement to +2. This causes the occupied Size to drop to 0 and the Safety to increase to +2. When he spends another season to install his third Minor Virtue, the occupied Size returns to +1, and the Safety drops to +1.

<span id="general-quality"></span>
=== General Quality ===

General Quality is simply an overall measure of the effectiveness of the lab in all areas. General Quality adds to all Lab Totals. This bonus (or penalty, if the General Quality is negative) applies in addition to any other Lab Total adjustments (such as from Specializations). This Characteristic has no effect on teaching (except for teaching spells, which uses a Lab Total) or the scribing of texts.

<span id="opkeep"></span>
== '''Opkeep''' ==

Upkeep specifies the monetary cost of building and maintaining the lab. For example, a lab with priceless ingredients may have a better General Quality, but it is also more expensive to maintain. A lab with an Upkeep of 0 costs 5 pounds to build and 1 pound per typical year of use to maintain. See Chapter 6: Covenants for the costs of labs with other Upkeep scores.

There may be insufficient money to maintain a lab at its current Upkeep. In this case, after two seasons of use with neglected maintenance, a new Flaw is gained automatically (or an existing Virtue lost), which reduces the Upkeep. This may need to be repeated (after another two seasons) until the Upkeep drops to an affordable level. For example, Semita Errabunda experiences a temporary financial crisis, and can only afford to spend one pound per year on Darius's Upkeep +2 laboratory (which normally needs three pounds per year). After two seasons, the lab gains a Flaw which reduces the Upkeep to +1, and after a further two seasons, another Flaw, taking the Upkeep to 0.

If a new Virtue or Flaw (or its removal) results in a increase to Upkeep, then the difference between the old and new build costs (which are 1 pound per 2 points of the lab; see Chapter 6: Covenants) must be paid. For example, raising the Upkeep from +2 to +4 (an increase of 70 points) costs 35 pounds. Thereafter, maintenance is paid at the new, higher rate. However if the Upkeep score should drop, there is no refund.

<span id="safety"></span>
== Safety ==

The higher the Safety, the lower the risk of any lab accidents, and vice versa. The Safety score subtracts its value from the number of botch dice on all lab activities. (Thus, a negative Safety results in more botch dice.) Labs with a zero or better Safety are fairly trustworthy places — there is only a significant danger of an accident with certain categories of lab activities (those requiring a stress roll, such as when using experimentation, or when studying from vis). Labs with a negative Safety, however, are deemed unsafe. With an unsafe lab, there is always the risk of an accident, no matter what type of lab work is undertaken. While some magi are prepared to accept the level of risk of a slightly negative Safety, such as -1 or -2, it is a very reckless magus who is prepared to work repeatedly in a highly unsafe lab.

For each season of work in an unsafe lab, roll a simple die. (This extra roll is in addition to any others which may be made, such as for experimentation or study from vis.) If the result is less than or equal to the absolute value of the Safety (in other words, ignore the minus sign), there is a chance of suffering a lab botch, in which case make a roll the usual number of botch dice (including the extra dice for having a negative Safety). For this roll, you cannot have no botch dice; there is always a minimum of at least one. In the event of a botch, a lab accident is suffered — consult the Disaster sub-chart of the Experimentation: Extraordinary Results chart (see page 275).

For example, Helvius spends a season to invent a spell (something that would normally be safe, and not require a roll) in his laboratory,

which has a Safety of –2. Helvius's player rolls a simple die, getting a 1, which is less than or equal to 2, so there is a chance of suffering a lab botch. He then rolls for botch with two botch dice (the base number of none for this activity, plus two for the Safety score). One of the dice comes up as 0, for a lab accident. On a single botch, Helvius suffers a single Warping Point. He got off quite lightly.

<span id="carping-1"></span>
== '''Carping''' ==

A laboratory with a zero Warping score produces consistent and predictable results (at least, it does if it isn't unsafe and you don't use experimentation). A lab with a positive Warping score, however, sometimes yields altered or unintended results. For each season of labwork, roll a simple die. If the result is less than or equal to the Warping score, then the product of that season's work (be it an item, spell, or something else) suffers Warping. Warping on labwork is not the same as for characters; instead refer to the Experimentation: Extraordinary Results chart (see page 275). If the outcome of the simple die was odd, roll once for a Side Effect. If the outcome was even, roll once for a Modified Effect. Effects should be chosen as appropriate for the cause(s) of the Warping. For example, an item

enchanted in an invisible lab might be found to be invisible itself, once it is finished and removed from the lab.

A lab with a positive Warping score should also be assigned one or more Personality Traits, with a total score equal to the Warping score. For example, a lab with a Warping score of +1, due to faerie ingredients, might gain the Personality Trait Whimsical +1. These Personality Traits tend to color the experience of the lab's owner and any other residents or guests, and are suggestive of suitable Warping effects, both for Warping on labwork, and on any character Warping suffered by the inhabitant(s). At the storyguide's discretion, a Personality Trait may be added to a Lab Total for an effect which matches it closely, or subtracted from a Lab Total for an opposite effect.

The environment of a laboratory might be either beneficial or detrimental to the health of its owner. A lab with a positive Health score might be especially snug, comfortable, or clean, whereas a lab with a negative Health might be drafty, awkward to get around, or bear a foul stench. The Health score adds to any Wound Recovery rolls for inhabitants of the lab. Also, half of the Health score (rounded down) adds to the Living Conditions modifier (used for Aging rolls) for inhabitants, provided that they spend at least half of the year there. In this way, the Living Conditions modifier of a lab (or sanctum) might differ from that of the covenant as a whole.

For example, the lab of Igor Rastvan has a Health of +2, giving +1 to the Living Conditions modifier. His covenant of Roznov has a base Living Conditions modifier of +2 for magi, therefore his total Living Conditions modifier is +3.

=== Aesthetics ===

Aesthetics is a measure of the impressiveness, splendor, and luxury of the laboratory. Whilst this is mostly a question of personal comfort and preferences, the aesthetic quality of a lab may affect the prestige enjoyed by its owner, influencing her standing amongst her peers. The Aesthetics score is indicative of the typical impression received by

<span id="laboratory-specializations-and-appearance"></span>
== Laboratory Specializations and Appearance ==

Experimentation: The lab might or refining contraption, such as be equipped with bizarre custom an elaborate still, and numerous outfittings, or have a nonstandard configuration which appears confusing or even dangerous to the uninitiated.

Familiar: Such a lab often resembles one with a specialization in Animal. It likely features some kind of pen or dwelling for a familiar prominently.

Items: The lab usually resembles a kind of workshop, with a great variety of tools, and is likely to be smelly, dirty, or noisy.

Longevity Rituals: The lab often closely resembles one with a specialization in Creo or Corpus. It might feature a pallet where a live subject can be

Spells: This Specialization is not usually immediately obvious, as the lab differs in only subtle ways from the norm. It may feature a large empty space, such as a summoning circle, where spells are tested.

Teaching: The lab is usually comfortable, with a preordained position for both master and pupil, such as a desk before a teaching pulpit.

Texts: The lab usually features a desk or bookstand prominently, contains a wide variety of writing materials, and is well lit.

Vis Extraction: Such a lab often features some kind of measuring

containers for vis

Creo: The lab is often brightly lit, clean, or contains many growing things. It is usually a pleasant environment.

Intellego: Such an esoteric lab might contain many books or astronomical devices, as well as viewing objects such as orbs or a scrying pool.

Muto: The lab might appear chaotic or in a state of constant change. Perhaps the owner is continually rearranging things.

Perdo: The lab might be dark or dirty, possibly containing decaying or dead things. It is often an unpleasant place.

Rego: Such a lab is tidy and well ordered, with everything neatly arranged.

Animal: This Specialization is usually evident from the lab's feral smell. It may contain numerous fauna specimens, dead or alive, and the floor may be littered with straw, fur, or droppings

Aguam: The lab almost always features some kind of water, either still or flowing, and may be damp.

Auram: Such a lab is often spacious, with a high ceiling, and might feature a window or balcony, or even be exposed to the elements.

Corpus: The lab might contain human corpses and body parts, such as blood, bones, and skin, or even live subjects. Perhaps it resembles a surgery, with the tools of a chirurgeon present.

Herbam: Such a lab. predictably, features plants, either in pots, or growing out of the floor or walls, or the lab itself might be built of living wood. It may have a smell of foliage, blossom, or wood.

Ignem: The lab is usually very well heated, with multiple fireplaces or a furnace, or it may be lit by many hundreds of candles. It may smell of smoke or sulfur.

Imaginem: The lab may be extravagantly decorated, or even partly illusory. Equally, it may give the impression of having some other specialization, since this lab may not be all it seems.

Mentem: Such a lab is often puzzling and elaborate, and may feature esoteric toys or ornate

Terram: The lab is often subterranean, and is usually solidly built, with an earthy or mineral smell. Many samples of metals, gems, or crystals may be present.

Vim: Such a Specialization is usually hard to spot, as there is no characteristic appearance, apart perhaps from an increased overall complexity.

visitors to the lab, and whether or not it is favorable. For every point of Aesthetics, either positive or negative, the owner gains five experience points in an appropriate Reputation. These points might not all be gained immediately, especially if few people visit the laboratory. Sooner or later, however, rumors will spread about just what is believed to be inside, even if it is mostly speculation, especially among the covenfolk.

For example, Lutisse has a lab with an Aesthetics of -2. She gains ten experience points in her Impoverished Hedge Wizard Reputation.

<span id="laboratory-specializations"></span>
== Laboratory Specializations ==

Laboratories that have Specializations are particularly well-suited to one or more types of laboratory work or to certain Arts, providing a bonus (in almost all cases, to the Lab Total) equal to their value. These benefits arise, either by design or by accident, from certain properties of the lab and its outfittings according to the law of sympathy. For example, a brightly lit lab is more suited to Imaginem, a lab with a water feature is suited to Aquam, and a lab with caged slaves is suited to Corpus.

<span id="build-point-cost-for-starting-laboratorics"></span>
== Build Point Cost for Starting Laboratorics ==

If using the Customized Covenant Creation rules (page 178), the baseline is that there is one standard laboratory (Size 0, Refinement 0) for each member of the covenant. Extra (spare) labs cost 50 Build Points each. For each magus that completely lacks a lab, 50 Build Points are gained. To determine the Build Point cost of labs which are either larger or smaller than average, multiply their Size Characteristics by 20.

One or more labs might start out with Minor or Major Virtues, if they have sufficient space (or if they are balanced with Flaws). Each Minor Virtue costs 10 Build Points and each Major Virtue costs 20 Build Points. Free Virtues and all Flaws do not cost any Build Points. Note that starting laboratories with negative Size need to take one or more Flaws (Minor or Major) automatically.

For example, a covenant which starts with Size +2 labs for two of its magi (80 Points), plus Size 0 labs for the remaining magi, a spare Size 0 lab (50 Points), with a total of three Minor Virtues (30 Points) and one Major Virtue (20 Points) costs a total of 180 Build Points. If the Build Point total for the labs is negative, Build Points are freed up which may be spent elsewhere.

It is suggested that labs for starting magi in a Spring covenant should begin with few or no Virtues or Flaws. Only those Virtues and Flaws which are intrinsic to the structure or location should be taken. For example, if the lab is underground, the Subterranean Flaw should be taken. At the storyguide's option, a small number of Free Virtues and an equal number of Free Flaws may be taken, provided that the Upkeep does not increase beyond 0. If the covenant has the Wealth Boon, on the other hand, then Free Virtues which require only an increase to Upkeep may be taken without a corresponding Free Flaw, if desired. With the Poverty Hook, it is suggested that the average Upkeep score for all labs should not be higher than -2 (if Minor) or -5 (if Major) — take a sufficient number of Flaws accordingly.

Labs in established covenants, on the other hand, especially Autumn or Winter covenants, might have more Virtues and Flaws, as might the labs of experienced magi. The storyguide should determine the labs of starting magi in an established covenant. For example, they might have one or more Supernatural Virtues and Flaws. For experienced magi, the Build Point total of the lab's Virtues should be subtracted from their experience point total, instead of from the covenant's Build Point total, assuming they were responsible for the improvements. This is due to the time required to achieve the Virtues; each Minor Virtue, taking one season, costs 10 points, and each Major Virtue, taking two seasons, costs 20 points, according to the rules for generating magi after apprenticeship (see page 50).

A lab can have at most two activity Specializations, plus four Art Specializations (at most two of which can be Techniques). Bonuses to Lab Totals from all applicable Specializations are cumulative. The value of an Art Specialization adds to any Lab Total (but not Advancement Total) involving that Art. The following is a list of possible activity Specializations:

Experimentation: The value of the Specialization adds to all Lab Totals when experimenting (see page 274).

Familiar: The value of the Specialization adds to all Lab Totals when binding or enchanting a familiar.

''Items'': The value of the Specialization adds to all Lab Totals when enchanting items and when investigating enchanted items.

Longevity Rituals: The value of the Specialization adds to all Lab Totals when creating a Longevity Ritual.

''Spells'': The value of the Specialization adds to all Lab Totals when inventing a spell, including when being taught the spell.

Teaching: The value of the Specialization adds to all Training and Teaching Source Qualities, whenever training or teaching is performed in the lab. However, this can provide a bonus of at most three points. (Note that teaching spells does not involve a Source Quality, and so is not covered here.)

Texts: The value of the Specialization adds to all Lab Totals when creating an effect with the benefit of a Laboratory Text, as well as to Lab Totals for translating Laboratory Texts. For every full three points of this Specialization, you may also add one to Profession: Scribe whenever copying Laboratory Texts and books, and one to the relevant Language Ability when writing Laboratory Texts and books.

Vis Extraction: The value of the Specialization adds to the Lab Total for vis extraction.

Specializations are gained due to Virtues (most notably Features and Magic Items) and sometimes also due to Flaws. Therefore, to determine the Specializations of your magus's lab (if any), simply total up the Specializations specified for each of its Virtues and Flaws (for some of them, you are able to choose the Specialization).

If you find that the laboratory has more than the allowed number of Specializations, you will have to drop one or more of them. You do not need to drop any Virtues or Flaws, just choose which Specializations you least want, and strike them out. Once made, however, the choice of dropped Specializations is hard to change — the magus must spend a season reconfiguring the laboratory to do so, which can be combined with a season of work to improve the Refinement of the laboratory.

<span id="laboratory-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== Laboratory Virtues and Flaws ==

Just as for characters, Virtues for labs reflect some kind of merit, improvement, or advantage, whereas Flaws reflect a drawback, deficiency, or story opportunity. The most important rule to bear in mind is that the number of points spent on Virtues, minus the number of points spent on Flaws, cannot exceed the Size + Refinement of the lab. The sum of these two Characteristics specifies the overall available space for the installment of improvements. Virtues with a point cost take up a certain amount of space, whereas Flaws with a point cost free up space, or allow the lab to be smaller. Free Virtues and Flaws make a negligible contribution to space. For example, a lab with a Size of +1 and a Refinement of +1 (for a total of +2) might have one Major Virtue and one Minor Virtue (+4 points) and two Minor Flaws (-2 points) as well as a number of Free Virtues and Flaws. A standard lab of Size 0 or greater starts with no Virtues and Flaws, but a lab smaller than the standard or less refined automatically starts with sufficient points of Flaws to pay for its negative Size + Refinement

Most laboratory Virtues and Flaws can only be taken once — those few that can be taken multiple times are asterisked in the list below. Two of these Virtues in particular, Feature and Magic Item, come in a multitude of types and are described in more detail later. The storyguide may always adjust the benefits of particular Virtues and Flaws as she sees fit, and is encouraged to devise new ones in consultation with the players.

The Covenants supplement includes a wider range of Virtues and Flaws (from page 113), expanding on those given here.

<span id="virtues-1"></span>
=== Virtues ===

A laboratory has free space for one or more new Virtues if its current points of Virtues minus points of Flaws is less than the Size + Refinement, and thus the occupied Size is less than the Size. If there are sufficient points of free space, a Virtue can be taken without needing to take a Flaw. Otherwise, one or more Flaws must be taken simultaneously to balance it. A magus who wishes to install a Virtue (Minor or Major) into a standard laboratory thus has four choices: either first spend a season to increase the Refinement to +1 (requiring a Magic Theory of 4), accept a Flaw to balance the Virtue, somehow increase the physical space of the existing lab, or move into a bigger lab. Free Virtues have no point cost and are thus not restricted in this way.

Virtues are not simply chosen and gained automatically — there may be a cost in time, money, or vis, and there may be additional specific requirements (see the list below). As a general rule, it takes one season of work to gain a

Minor Virtue, and two seasons to gain a Major Virtue. This time is occupied with construction or installing the improvement. The person doing this work needs to have a Magic Theory score at least three points higher than the lab's Refinement. Free Virtues have no space and (usually) no seasonal construction requirement. They may be gained in a day or so, if the relevant materials are procured, or if the relevant circumstances are satisfied.

Sometimes, the magus might wish to lose Virtues. This is not always possible, since some Virtues are due to fundamental properties of the lab (such as its physical location) which cannot readily be changed. Where it is possible, a Minor or Major Virtue can only be removed during a season or more of work to improve the laboratory (either by increasing the Refinement, or installing a different Virtue). For example, the magus can remove an existing Lesser Feature and replace it with a new one, in one season. Where it is possible to remove a Free Virtue, it can usually be done in a day or so.

<span id="plams"></span>
== Plams ==

Flaws may be chosen either due to choice or to general neglect, or because you need to free up points of space to balance a new Virtue. There is no limit on their number and they take effect immediately. In the event of a lack of funds, you may also be forced to take a Flaw resulting in a lower Upkeep (see the Upkeep section, above).

Just as for Virtues, some Flaws can later be removed, whereas others are due to fundamental properties of the lab, and cannot be altered. If removing a Minor or Major Flaw, the magus needs to have sufficient free points of space, since the occupied Size will increase. Where it is possible, removing a Free Flaw usually takes one season (unless otherwise stated), removing a Minor Flaw also takes one season, and removing a Major Flaw takes two seasons. This time is occupied with repairing or restoring the faulty component, but it can be combined with a season spent improving

the Refinement. For example, a lab might start out with Size –1, Refinement 0, and the Cramped Flaw. With a Magic Theory of 4, one season of work will suffice both to increase the Refinement to +1 and to lose the Cramped Flaw.

<span id="structure-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
==== Structure Virtues and Flaws ====

These Virtues and Flaws are due to the physical structure and basic arrangement of the laboratory, and its location. Gaining or losing them usually entails some kind of construction project on or within the lab, or on the immediate surrounds.

<span id="virtues-major"></span>
==== VIRTUES (MAJOR) ====

Greater Feature*: The lab prominently features a unique and extensive structure which aids certain types of lab work — see the list of possible Features later (page 296). +2 Aesthetics; 3 points on appropriate Specialization(s).

Natural Environment: A swathe of natural scenery, such as forest, desert, or a river, is located in the lab, or the lab is built in or around it. +2 Aesthetics; 3 points among Specializations in Cr, An, Aq, Au, He, Ig, or Te, depending upon terrain type.

<span id="virtues-minor"></span>
==== VIRTUES (MINOR) ====

Extensive Stores: The lab's large stores mean that it can withstand shortages better. In the case of a lack of funds, the lab can last six seasons before you have to take a Flaw to lower the Upkeep, instead of the usual two. However you need to make a one-off payment of a number of pounds equal to the lab's yearly maintenance cost, to stock up the stores in the first place. Vis and dangerous materials can also be stored more safely. +2 Safety.

Gallery: The lab is fitted with an interior gallery or platform, designed to allow someone to view the whole of the lab without disturbing it. +1 Safety, +1 Aesthetics; +1 Teaching.

Lesser Feature*: The lab features a unique structure which aids certain types of lab work — see the list of possible Features later (page 296). +1 Aesthetics; 1 point on an appropriate Specialization.

<span id="virtues-free"></span>
==== VIRTUES (FREE) ====

'''Dedicated Building:''' The lab (and probably the living quarters of the owner) is in its own building, shared with no-one else. There are likely to be fewer distractions. +1 Upkeep, +1 Aesthetics; +1 Re.

Mobile: The entire lab can be readily moved. For example, it might be located on a ship or (if it is very small) a cart. This Virtue is usually taken with the Unstable Flaw. +1 Experimentation.

'''Superior Construction''': The lab benefits from distinguished construction techniques, for example, high quality building materials were used, or it was made by a master architect or a

magus (such as with the spell ''Conjuring the Mystic Tower''). If constructing the building, its cost is doubled. +1 Safety, +1 Aesthetics.

<span id="flaws-free"></span>
==== FLAWS (FREE) ====

'''Deformed''': Part of the structure has subsided or is otherwise warped. For example, one wall has partially collapsed into rubble, and has to be propped up. –1 Safety, –1 Aesthetics; +1 Mu or Pe.

Empty*: The lab has a large amount of empty, unused space. A lab that is much bigger than it needs to be is a disadvantage since it costs more to maintain the empty space — it takes more to heat, light, and clean the chamber. Alternatively, if the empty space is neglected, it will likely gather dirt and cobwebs, or cause a draft. This Flaw should be taken for every full two points by which the Size of the lab exceeds the occupied Size. As soon as the empty space is filled up, this Flaw is lost.

—1 Aesthetics, either +1 Upkeep or —1 Health.

Low Ceiling*: The ceiling is lower than the requisite ten feet, which slightly hampers some magical activities. This Flaw should be taken twice if the ceiling is less than eight feet, or thrice if the magus has to stoop (in which case also take –2 Health). –1 General Quality, –1 Safety, –1 Aesthetics.

Subterranean: The lab is underground. There is a lack of natural light, and so more candles are required for lighting. +1 Upkeep, -1 Health, -1 Aesthetics; +1 Te.

Unstable*: The lab is prone to movements, for example it is on a ship, is earthquake-prone, or merely has dodgy foundations, which is the occasional cause of accidents or breakages. This Flaw may be taken more than once for a greater instability. +1 Upkeep, –1 Safety.

<span id="flaws-minor"></span>
==== FLAWS (MINOR) ====

Cramped: The lab equipment is packed a little too close together for comfort, due to lack of space. This slightly hampers all but one type of lab activity, which is taken as a Specialization. The lab can be reconfigured to change the Specialization with a season of work. (This can be done at the same time as working to increase the Refinement.) –1 General Quality, –1 Upkeep, –2 Safety, –1 Aesthetics; 1 point on an activity Specialization.

Lesser Focus: An existing Lesser Feature is the central focus of the lab, enhancing the Feature, but making activities that do not involve its use more difficult. –1 General Quality, 2 points among Specializations provided by the Feature.

No Stores: The lab has nowhere to store supplies, and so it cannot withstand any shortages (in the case of a lack of funds, compulsory Flaw(s) to reduce the Upkeep are taken immediately, instead of after the usual two seasons). Vis and dangerous materials cannot be stored very safely. –2 Safety.

<span id="flaws-major"></span>
==== FLAWS (MAJOR) ====

Greater Focus: An existing Greater Feature is the overwhelming focus of the lab, enhancing the Feature, but making activities that do not involve its use more difficult. –2 General Quality; 4 points among Specializations provided by the Feature.

<span id="outfittings-virtues-and-plaws"></span>
== Outfittings Virtues and Plaws ==

These Virtues and Flaws are due to the quality and quantity of the mundane materials and equipment that are in the lab, as well as any other inhabitants of the lab. Gaining or losing these Virtues and Flaws thus usually entails the purchase or acquisition of things to put in the lab, or the lack of (or defects in) such things.

<span id="virtues-major-1"></span>
==== VIRTUES (MAJOR) ====

Greater Expansion: The extent of the lab is greatly increased, with at least double the usual amount of equipment. This allows it to have more areas and equipment dedicated to specialized tasks.

+2 General Quality, +4 Upkeep, +1 Aesthetics, 2 points on any Specialization(s).

<span id="virtues-minor-1"></span>
==== VIRTUES (MINOR) ====

Lesser Expansion: The extent of the lab is increased, with some more specialized equipment. +1 General Quality, +2 Upkeep, 1 point on any Specialization.

Living Quarters: The lab contains suitable furniture, such as a bed, a wardrobe, and so on, such that the owner may live and sleep in it. There is a small benefit to lab work if you live in the lab proper, but it is not good for your health, and is considered somewhat obsessive. +1 General Quality, -1 Safety, -2 Health, -2 Aesthetics.

Specimens*: The lab has a large collection of related things, stored in visible containers such as jars, or otherwise serving as objects of study or decoration. +1 Upkeep, +1 Aesthetics; 1 point on any Form Specialization.

<span id="virtues-free-1"></span>
==== VIRTUES (FREE) ====

Assistant*: A Gifted assistant (such as an Hermetic apprentice) helps out in the lab, affording a bonus to lab work. +(assistant's Intelligence + Magic Theory) General Quality. (This is simply a restatement of the existing bonuses.)

Guard*: A shield grog is on permanent duty at the lab's entrance, and may dissuade unwanted visitors from pestering the magus or intruding. +1 Aesthetics.

Highly Organized: The lab's contents have been optimally arranged. There is a chance to gain this Virtue whenever a season of work is undertaken to improve the Refinement (see Refinement, above). A season of such work (with the normal chances of changes to laboratory Virtues and Flaws) may still be undertaken, even if no improvement to

Refinement is possible. This Virtue is lost if a major accident is suffered, if someone else uses the lab, or if someone of lower Intelligence helps in it. +1 General Quality.

Person*: There is another person, perhaps a close family member or a maid, who is to be found very frequently (as a rule of thumb, most days, for at least an hour) in the lab. This Virtue may be taken once for each such person who regularly comes in to the lab. Do not count the owner or any full-time lab assistants, such as an apprentice. A full-time trained mundane assistant is instead catered for by the Servant Virtue. –1 Safety; +1 Co or Me.

Servant: One of the covenfolk is employed as a full-time lab servant, to perform the most mundane or bothersome tasks in the lab, and cater to the needs of the magus. +(servant's Intelligence/2, rounding up) Safety, +1 Aesthetics; +1 Me.

'''Spotless:''' The lab is impeccably clean. This requires a season of work to gain. Also, there is a chance to gain this Virtue whenever a season of work is undertaken to improve the Refinement (see Refinement, above). This Virtue is lost if cleanliness is not maintained, or after an accident or neglect is suffered. +1 Health, +1 Aesthetics; +1 Cr.

<span id="flaws-free-1"></span>
==== FLAWS (FREE) ====

Basic: The lab setup is incomplete, and not all the necessary equipment has been installed. This Flaw is acquired after the first season of lab construction (see The Standard Hermetic Laboratory, earlier). It is removed after the second season of work completes the lab. –3 General Quality.

Damaged: The lab is partially damaged, for example as the result of a lab accident. It takes one season to repair the damage and lose this Flaw.

-2 General Quality, -1 Safety, -1 Aesthetics.

'''Disorganized:''' The lab is organized in a rather haphazard or carefree fashion. Some magi prefer it this way. –1 Safety, –1 Aesthetics; +1 Mu or Experimentation.

Hidden Defect*: A subtle and potentially dangerous error exists in the lab's configuration. This is usually the fault of the owner, but it may also be caused by a malicious and clever third party. There is a chance to gain (or lose) this Flaw whenever a season of work is undertaken to improve the Refinement (see Refinement, earlier). Whenever this defect is the cause of a lab botch, make a Perception + Magic Theory roll against an Ease Factor of 12. If this succeeds, the defect is spotted and may be corrected with a few hours of work. –3 Safety.

Missing Ingredients*: Due to a lack of certain ingredients, lab work involving either one specific Technique or two specific Forms is severely hampered — relevant Lab Totals are halved. For example, the lab might contain no silver, in which case Terram and Vim Lab Totals

are halved. It does not take a season to remove this Flaw, if sufficient funds are available to increase the Upkeep. –1 Upkeep.

Missing Sanctum Marker: The sanctum marker is not prominently displayed, and is thus easy to miss, or it is missing altogether. Hermetic magi might (unwittingly or knowingly) intrude. It does not take a season to remove this Flaw. —1 Aesthetics.

'''Wrecked:''' The lab is very heavily damaged, for example as the result of a major lab accident. It takes two seasons to repair the damage completely and lose this Flaw. (After one season, it may be replaced by the Damaged Flaw.) –5 General Quality, –2 Safety, –2 Aesthetics.

<span id="flaws-minor-1"></span>
==== FLAWS (MINOR) ====

Missing Equipment*: Due to a lack of certain equipment, lab work in one or two types of activity is totally impossible. For example, if there is no desk, parchment, or inks, you cannot work with texts. If you pick Items, Spells, or Texts, only this one activity cannot be undertaken. Otherwise, you must pick two of the activity categories (see the Specialization section earlier, page 290). This Flaw cannot be taken more than twice. —1 Upkeep.

'''Undecorated''': The lab has very spartan decoration, or the decoration is completely lacking, making the place rather uninspiring and unwelcoming.

—1 Upkeep, —1 Aesthetics; subtract one point from any Specializations with a score of 2 or more.

<span id="flaws-major-1"></span>
==== FLAWS (MAJOR) ====

Elementary: This is a cut-down version of a Hermetic laboratory, with an extremely limited selection of lab equipment installed, so that only one category of lab activity (see the list of possible activity Specializations earlier on page ) is possible at all. The type of activity is determined at the time of construction, and is fixed thereafter. Still, such a limited lab is cheaper to maintain and takes only one season to build completely. It might be suitable for an extremely confined space, such as in a small cave, or in a wagon. Some covenants build elementary labs in powerful auras for the purposes of vis extraction. –2 General Quality, –3 Upkeep.

<span id="supernatural-virtues-and-plaws"></span>
=== Supernatural Virtues and Plaws ===

These Virtues and Flaws are due to supernatural effects, creatures, or items. The means of gaining or losing these Virtues and Flaws varies widely — most cannot be gained by some straightforward effort on the part of a magus. Some, such as gaining a supernatural guardian, may require a story or a Hermetic breakthrough. Others, such as the presence of a vis source in the lab, or a Hermetic predecessor, are generally choices for the storyguide to make, rather than the player. In the latter case, the player might not be aware of these Virtues and Flaws (and thus the complete statistics of the lab).

<span id="virtues-major-2"></span>
==== VIRTUES (MAJOR) ====

Greater Guardian: A powerful supernatural creature (Might 20 or higher), which is not the familiar of the owner, resides in the lab and acts as its protector, being well-disposed to the owner. Woe betide any who should intrude. +(creature's Intelligence) Safety, +1 Warping, +1 Aesthetics; 3 points on appropriate Art specialization(s).

<span id="virtues-minor-2"></span>
==== VIRTUES (MINOR) ====

Familiar: The owner of the lab has a familiar, and the familiar lives in the lab. Perhaps it even helps with lab work. This Virtue assumes that the familiar takes up a non-trivial amount of space. If not, this can be instead taken as a Free Virtue. +(familiar's Intelligence + Magic Theory) General Quality, +(Golden Cord) Safety. (This is simply a restatement of the existing bonuses.)

Lesser Guardian: A supernatural creature (less than Might 20), which is not the familiar of the owner, resides in the lab and acts as its protector, being well-disposed to the owner. +1 Safety, 1 point on an appropriate Art specialization.

Vis Source*: A naturally-occurring source of vis is to be found in the lab. –1 Safety, +1 Warping; 2 points on the appropriate Art Specialization.

<span id="virtues-free-2"></span>
==== VIRTUES (FREE) ====

Enchantment*: The lab itself has been enchanted as a magic item. This may grant Virtues or Flaws, alter Characteristics, or add to Specializations (see the guidelines later).

Inexhaustible Supplies: The lab is blessed with magically replenishing ingredients and consumables which never run out. –3 Upkeep, +1 Warping.

Magic Item*: A magic item is installed in the lab. It might be self-made, donated, purchased, or perhaps some kind of artifact which was found in the lab. If the item is very large, taking up a significant amount of space in the lab, then it should be treated as a Minor Virtue instead of a Free Virtue. This may grant Virtues or Flaws, alter Characteristics, or add to Specializations (see the guidelines later).

Regio*: The interior of the lab is in a regio, and there is an another regio level, which the owner can navigate easily. If there are further regio levels, this Virtue may be taken more than once. +3 Size, +1 Warping.

<span id="flaws-free-2"></span>
==== FLAWS (FREE) ====

<span id="laboratory-features"></span>
== Laboratory Features ==

Specialized labs often have certain noteworthy or unique structural features (one or more Greater Feature or Lesser Feature Virtues), which aid or inspire certain types of magic. Features may be added to a lab with relatively little disruption, if space permits. Alternatively, the lab may be rearranged such that one Feature becomes the lab's central focus (in which case, take the Greater Focus or Lesser Focus Flaw, as appropriate). A lab may only have one Focus. In this case, lab activities which are unrelated to the Feature are disadvantaged, but the specialized benefits of the Feature are increased. In either case, it takes one or two seasons to build or assemble the structure, for a Lesser Feature or Greater Feature, respectively.

Below are listed some example Features, together with the possible Specializations for each. Many labs have a number of these things, but they do not necessarily count as a Feature, unless purchased with either the Greater Feature or Lesser Feature Virtue. The former provides three points on Specialization(s), the latter one point. You may choose to distribute these points amongst the listed Specializations as you wish. You should feel free to come up with your own ideas for Features, since just about anything that may be found in a Hermetic laboratory may be made into a Feature.

<span id="the-sanctum"></span>
== The Sanctum ==

Any member of the Order of Hermes may designate an area as their &quot;sanctum,&quot; and most choose to designate their laboratory and living quarters. A decision of the First Tribunal means that a magus in another's sanctum has no legal protection from the owner of the sanctum and may be attacked or killed without legal consequences. There is a strong convention against entering a sanctum without permission, but the Peripheral Code on these points differs between Tribunals. See Houses of Hermes: True Lineages for more details—particularly pages 46–47, 62, and 71. A ruling of the Grand Tribunal of 997 requires a sanctum to be marked by a circle inscribed within a square, with lines joining the square's opposite corners.

<span id="magic-items-for-laboratories"></span>
== Magic Items for Laboratories ==

A magic item designed for lab use (or an enchantment on the whole lab itself) can grant one or more Virtues or Flaws, or add to the Characteristics or Specializations of the lab. A magic item may be made into a Feature, in which case that Virtue should be paid for as usual. Equally, an existing Feature may be enchanted as a magic item. In this case, if the Shape and Material bonus(es) of the Feature are not listed elsewhere, you may assume it to have Shape and Material Bonuses equal to its points of Arts Specializations provided.

Specific effects for each item should be created as normal. If an effect cannot be conceived of which yields the desired benefit, then it is probably not possible. To provide a benefit, an effect must also be new to the laboratory, and not duplicate any existing effects. For each effect, there are two possible ways to determine the appropriate modifications to the lab's statistics:

* If the effect duplicates an existing Laboratory Virtue or Flaw, then the item simply grants that Virtue or Flaw to the lab. It is gained immediately and has no space cost, apply its stated modifications to Characteristics or Specializations, as usual.
* If the effect does not resemble a Laboratory Virtue or Flaw, then the final level of the effect determines how many points of Characteristics or Specializations may be gained. Every ten levels may grant one point in a Specialization, or every 20 levels may improve a Characteristic by one point. For example, an effect with a final level of 50 might improve one Characteristic by one point (20 levels), and one Specialization by three points (30 levels). Also, items or enchantments with powerful effects, influencing the whole of the lab, may (unintentionally) increase the Warping Characteristic, at the discretion of the storyguide.

<span id="levels"></span>
==== Levels ====

another animal.

The level of a spell is a measure of the amount of magical power needed to create the spell effect. The higher the level of the spell, the less of a magus's power is left over for breaking through Magic Resistance. It is made up of the base level of the spell, as determined by the guideline for the effect of the spell, plus adjustments for changes in Range, Duration, Target, and size.

<span id="magnitudes"></span>
== Magnitudes ==

The magnitude of a spell is equal to one fifth of its level, rounded up. This is also the number of pawns of vis needed to cast a ritual spell, and changing the Range, Duration, or Target of a spell generally changes its level by one magnitude (five levels) at a time.

Spells of level one to five are all first magnitude, although the rules for changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets work differently for such spells (see table on page 303).

Spell Magnitude: Level/5 (rounded up)

he troupe may always intervene and declare that a certain combination of Range, Duration, Target, and effect warrants a higher or lower level than that described by the guidelines and

the system below. The range of effects possible in Ars Magica is so large that any system is bound to allow some effects that strike a given troupe as too hard or too easy (different effects for different troupes). The system gives sensible levels in the vast majority of cases, but storyguides should not let players use the system to force things past common sense.

<span id="level-guidelines"></span>
== Level Guidelines ==

This chapter contains a selection of example spells, and guidelines for what can be achieved with a Formulaic or Spontaneous spell of a given level. For the guidelines, the range of the spell is Personal, the duration is Momentary, and the

target is Individual. These are the lowest members of their classes, so that the given level is the lowest level at which a Ritual, Formulaic or Spontaneous spell can have that effect.

Spell Guidelines: Range: Personal; Duration: Momentary; Target: Individual

<span id="ranges-durations-targets"></span>
== Ranges, Durations, Targets ==

The Range, Duration, and Target of a spell determine what it can affect. The Range governs how far the target can be from the magus, the Duration determines how long the target will be affected, and the Target describes what the spell can affect. Each parameter has a number of possible ratings, which can be arranged in order from least difficult to produce to most difficult to produce. This is done in the chart below. Parameters which are listed together below but are separated by a slash (like Touch/Eye) represent different actual ranges that share the same level of difficulty. They are not interchangeable, simply equally difficult.

Each category of Range, Duration, and Target is described below. The categories described here were built into the structure of Hermetic magic by Bonisagus. All Spontaneous spells must conform to these requirements (the magus is

fly—he cannot also push the limits of magic theory). Formulaic or Ritual spells, on the other hand, can be invented with Ranges, Durations or Targets that are not listed here. This is usually slightly more difficult than if the closest category were used, but is largely left to troupe interpretation.

<span id="changing-ranges-durations-and-targets"></span>
== Changing Ranges, Durations, and Targets ==

To calculate the level for a spell that does not use the base Range, Duration, and Target, add one magnitude (five levels) to the level of the spell for every step by which the parameter is raised. It is also possible to calculate levels based on an existing spell, with different Range, Duration, and Target. In that case, increasing them works in the same way, and for every step by which one is lowered, subtract one magnitude (five levels).

Below level 5, adding a magnitude only adds one level, and subtracting a magnitude only subtracts one level. Thus, one magnitude lower than level 5 is level 4, and one magnitude higher than level 2 is level 3.

For example, consider a level 15 spell with Range Voice, Duration Sun, and Target Group. A variant with the same effect but with Range Sight, Duration Moon, and Target Room would be level 25 (+1 magnitude to increase Range Voice to Sight, +1 magnitude to increase Duration Sun to Moon, and no change for changing

because they are at the same level). A different variant with Range Personal, Duration Concentration, and Target Individual would be level 2 (–2 magnitudes to decrease Range Voice to Personal, –1 magnitude to decrease Duration Sun to Concentration, and –2 magnitudes to decrease Target Group to Individual). Note that since –2 magnitudes takes the level from 15 to 5, the additional magnitudes of reduction only lower the level by –1 per magnitude.

<span id="ranges"></span>
=== Ranges ===

The range of a spell is the distance to the nearest part of the target of the spell. Thus, if the caster is touching the external wall of a room, he can cast a Target Room Corpus spell on the people within at Touch Range, even though he is not touching any of those people, and indeed cannot see them. The target of the spell is the room, and thus the spell does not violate the Limit of Arcane Connections.

A spell that has a continuing effect remains in effect even if the caster moves out of range. A spell that allows the caster to control the effect only permits that control as long as the caster is within range. However, it does not expire if the caster moves out of range, and he may control it again if he moves back into range.

Personal: The spell only affects the caster, defined in the same way as an Individual Target. Personal Range spells can never have a container Target (such as Circle, Room, or Structure). This adds no magnitudes to the guideline.

Touch: The magus or anything he touches, whether a person or thing. This adds 1 magnitude to the guideline.

Eye: The magus may target any person or creature that he has established eye contact with. A human being who knows of no reason to avoid eye contact makes it automatically if dealing with the magus in a social setting. The Gift does not make people avoid eye contact. It is impossible to make eye contact with an unwilling human without getting at least two people to hold the victim

down. It is effectively impossible to make eye contact with an enemy in combat; they aren't looking at your eyes. It typically takes a combat round to establish eye contact with a calm animal, before the magus can start casting the spell. This adds 1 magnitude to the guideline. (Touch and Eye are the same &quot;level&quot; of range.)

Voice: Anything to which the magus's voice carries. Typically, firm words carry about 15 paces, while quiet words are audible within 5 paces and a shout carries about 50. Magical enhancement of the voice does not increase this range, and a spell cast silently at this range can affect only the caster. The range of Ritual and ceremonial spells with Voice Range is about 50 paces, because the process of casting involves a loud voice at some point. Non-human casters, including Bjornaer in Heartbeast form, may have different ranges for their voice. Magical shapeshifting falls under magical enhancement of the voice, however. The range is based on the distance that the caster's voice carries, not on whether the target can hear it. Deaf targets, stones, targets in a noisy environment, and targets under the influence of Pelm spells that stop sounds from reaching them can all be affected at the normal range. However, if the caster is silenced or quietened by magic, the range is reduced. Such a spell must penetrate the caster's Magic Resistance. Magic items use the wielder's voice; independent items need to be given a voice (Crlm) to use this range. The range is established when the spell is cast, and remains the same even if the magus changes the loudness of his voice. Thus, a Voice range spell can allow silent control, but only as long as the target is within the distance that the magus's voice carried when he cast the spell. This adds 2 magnitudes to the guideline.

Sight: Anything that the magus can see. If the magus is standing on the highest point for miles, this range can be immense. A blind magus can only affect himself. A magic item uses the wielder's sight, independent items need to be able to see (InIm) to use this range. This adds 3 magnitudes to the guideline.

Arcane Connection: Anything that the magus has an Arcane Connection to. Distance is immaterial unless the storyguide chooses to impose some limit. Such limits are usually provided in the example spells. Note that while Arcane Connection is a range, it is different from a physical item that is an Arcane Connection. This distinction is important, because some spells require that the caster have an Arcane Connection, but the spell must be cast as some range other than Arcane Connection. This adds 4 magnitudes to the guideline.

<span id="durations"></span>
==== Durations ====

If a spell with a momentary effect, such as healing a wound, creating a fire, or opening a pit, is cast with a longer duration, it generally sustains that effect for the duration, rather than having its effect multiple times within the duration. Thus, a wound healed with duration Sun stays healed for that length of time, and reappears at the end. The target can still take other wounds. A fire created with duration Diameter burns for two minutes, and may inflict damage every round over that period. A pit opened for duration Moon with a Perdo Terram spell cannot be filled in with earth for that period; any more earth dumped in it is destroyed as well. Wood, animal products, or water could fill it, though, as they are not of the same Form as the spell. The destroyed earth still does not reappear at the expiration of the spell.

A magus can recast a spell with Diameter, Sun, Moon, or Year Duration at the end of its period, so that the effect is continuous, and does not briefly disappear between the two castings. The magus recasting the spell does not have to be the same person who cast the original spell, and it does not even have to be the same spell, although for a lot of spells an overlap will not make much difference. (This is important, for example, if a covenant casts a higher-level version of Aegis of the Hearth one year.) No roll is required to achieve this, but distracting events may prevent it. The critical period is about a Diameter for Sun, Moon, or Year spells, and any distraction that interrupts the recasting of the spell is enough to guarantee at least a short break for Diameter spells. For Ritual spells, it is easy for magi to determine when they must start casting to avoid a break, as such calculations are covered by Artes Liberales and Philosophiae, but if the Ritual is interrupted and must be restarted, there will not be enough time to restart that Ritual and cast it before the older spell ends.

Momentary: The spell lasts but a moment and then dissipates. In many cases the effects of the spell will endure long after the spell itself finishes. For example, a Rego spell that moves a rock from the bottom of the hill to the top might have Momentary duration, but the rock stays at the top of the hill. Similar considerations apply to most Perdo spells; the magic lasts but a moment, but the target stays destroyed. This adds no magnitudes to the guideline.

While a moment is a very short period of time, it may be rather more than an instant. It could be as long as a combat round (six seconds) for some spells, and maybe even very slightly longer, although that would be unusual. A single spell effect happens, over a short period of time, and then the spell stops.

Ritual Creo spells with Momentary Duration create things that last as any other thing of that type. The magic is gone in a moment and so cannot be dispelled. This also applies to Ritual healing spells. Note that unnatural things do not naturally last for any time at all, and so only last as long as the spell does, even when created with a Ritual. (A Creo spell to create such a thing would need a Muto requisite.)

Concentration: The spell lasts as long as the magus concentrates. In the absence of distractions, assume that a magus can concentrate for fifteen minutes per point of Concentration ability. If there are distractions, see the rules in the Hermetic Magic chapter, page 215. This adds 1 magnitude to the guideline.

Diameter: The spell lasts for the time that the sun takes to move its diameter in the sky — almost exactly two minutes (twenty combat rounds). (Diameter and Concentration are the same &quot;level&quot; of duration.) This adds 1 magnitude to the guideline.

'''Sun''': The spell lasts until the sun next rises or sets. This adds 2 magnitudes to the guideline.

Ring: The spell lasts until the target of the spell, or part of the target, moves outside a ring drawn at the time of casting, or until the ring is physically broken. This adds 2 magnitudes to the guideline.

A ring must actually be drawn while the spell is being cast. The magus may use magic to do so, but that magic must not have a range greater than Touch, and the magus must physically trace out the ring. The magus may not move more quickly than ten paces per round (five feet per second) while doing this. The casting of a non-Ritual spell may be extended out to allow the drawing of a large ring. However, the caster must make Int + Concentration rolls of 6+ every round to maintain concentration on the spell, and if someone breaks the ring at any point before it is completed, the spell automatically botches. Really large rings are unlikely to be worth the risk.

The ring may already exist, for example as a band laid into the ground. In this case, the magus must trace the full circumference of the ring, moving no more quickly than ten paces per round.

Moon: The spell lasts until both the new and full moon have set. This adds 3 magnitudes to the guideline.

Year: The spell lasts until sunrise on the fourth equinox or solstice after its casting. A spell with this duration must be ritual. This adds 4 magnitudes to the guideline.

<span id="target"></span>
=== Target ===

There are three types of target: objects, containers, and senses. A spell cast on an object Target affects the things in that Target for the duration of the spell, even if they change so that they would no longer qualify as a valid target for the original spell. If the caster is within range, she retains control of the spell, if the spell allows such control. Container targets are more complex, as described on page 309.

Individual: The spell can affect a single discrete thing, such as one person or one object. A huge boulder is a discrete object, a mountain is not (because it is joined to the ground). Clothes on a person or moss on a boulder are part of the person or boulder for these purposes. Individual is an object Target. This adds no magnitudes to the guideline.

Circle: The spell affects everything within a circle drawn by the magus at the time of casting, and ends if the circle is broken, even if that is before the duration of the spell expires. The spell also ends when its duration ends. See Ring, above, for restrictions on drawing the circle. One circle may serve to underwrite both Ring Duration and Circle Target. Circle is a container Target. This adds no magnitudes to the guideline.

Individual and Circle are the same level of effect.

Part: The spell can affect a part of a discrete thing, such as a person's arm or a section of the ground. This target refers to spatial parts, parts that you could, at least in theory, cut off and put in a bag. A person's mind is not a part of him in this sense, nor is his sense of humor. His heart, however, is. Something is only a Part target while it is actually a part of something else; things, like severed arms, that used to be part of something, or, like bricks, which could become part of something, are Individual targets as long as they are not currently part of something else. Part is harder than Individual because whole things are metaphysically important. It is easier to affect a thing as a whole than to affect a part of it. Part is an object Target. This adds 1 magnitude to the guideline.

Group: The spell can affect a group of people or things. The components of the group must be close together in space, and the group itself must be separated from any other things of the same type. Three grogs huddled together or a ring of standing stones are a group: six people out of a crowd are usually not. The things in the Group when the spell is cast are affected for the entire duration, even if they split up. Things that join the Group during the spell duration are not affected. It is possible to target a 'Group' with a single member, although an Individual target will always be lower level. Group is an object Target. This adds 2 magnitudes to the guideline.

Room: The spell affects everything within a chamber. The interior surfaces of the walls of the

room are within the Target, but their exterior surfaces are not. This room can be very large (the nave of a cathedral, for instance, or a natural cave), but it must be enclosed and have definite boundaries. A courtyard would often count, a valley would not. A spell with Target Room is useless if there is no Room containing the targets, it cannot affect a 'roughly room-sized volume' in open space. Room is a container Target. This adds 2 magnitudes to the guideline.

Group and Room are the same level of effect.

Structure: The spell affects everything within a single structure. The structure itself counts as within the structure for these purposes, as the limit is the outer edge of any walls. The structure can range in size from a hut to a castle keep, but it must be a single, linked complex. As a rule of thumb, if it is all covered by one roof, it is one structure, but troupe discretion applies. As with Room, target Structure is no use if there is no preexisting structure bounding the target. Structure is a container Target. This adds 3 magnitudes to the guideline.

Boundary: The spell affects everything within a well-defined natural or man-made boundary. This could be the wall of a city, the edge of a village, the shores of a lake, the edge of a forest, or the bottom of a mountain. Since the ocean is not obviously bounded, it cannot be affected in this way. As with Room and Structure, there must actually be a boundary for this target to be useful. It cannot be used to simply affect a really big area. A spell with this target must be a Ritual. Boundary is a container Target. This adds 4 magnitudes to the guideline.

<span id="magical-senses"></span>
== Magical Senses ==

Intellego spells can grant magical senses to a person. These spells allow the recipient to detect things that he could not normally sense, and they have different targets, corresponding to the kind of sense that the recipient gets. The range of the spell is the range to the recipient.

It is possible to grant magical senses to many people at once, but this requires Muto Mentem magic, with Intellego Form requisites.

Each magical sense Target grants the recipient information through one of his senses. This information is easily distinguished from mundane information coming through the same sense, but it is subject to the same limitations as the mundane sense. Thus, a magical sense that works with the sense of smell is very bad at giving direction, and can be avoided by staying upwind of the sensor, while a magical sense that works with vision is no good in the dark.

Magical senses must penetrate the Magic Resistance of creatures sensed, as well as the Magic Resistance (if any) of the person granted the sense. Thus, the Penetration of a magical sense should be recorded for future reference. The mundane sense through which the magical sense grants information does not need to penetrate Magic Resistance.

A single spell grants a single magical sense. To gain several magical senses, you must cast several spells.

Taste: The information comes through the sense of taste. This target is equal in level to Individual, and adds no magnitudes to the guideline.

Touch: The information comes through the sense of touch. This target is equal in level to Part, and adds 1 magnitude to the guideline.

Smell: The information comes through the sense of smell. This target is equal in level to Group, and adds 2 magnitudes to the guideline.

Hearing: The information comes through the sense of hearing. This target is equal in level to Structure, and adds 3 magnitudes to the guideline.

'''Vision''': The information comes through the sense of sight. This target is equal in level to Boundary, but, unlike Boundary, it does not require Ritual magic. It adds 4 magnitudes to the guideline.

<span id="magical-cards"></span>
=== Magical Cards ===

Rego spells can create wards which protect the target from things of the appropriate Form. These use the normal targets, but the target is the thing protected, rather than the things warded against, and the range is the range to the target, not to the things warded against.

Wards with a Circle target are of particular note. They prevent things warded against that are within the circle from leaving, and prevent things warded against that are outside from entering. Warded things cannot act across the circle, no matter which side they are on, nor can they damage the circle, directly or indirectly. It is quite common to create such spells with a duration of Ring, as then the ward can be made to last indefinitely, with care. Such wards target the circle itself, which cannot leave the circle, and thus last as long as the circle does. However, this is not required, and the spell can be created with any Duration.

The spell guidelines for wards against magical things are listed with a base range of Touch, base duration of Ring, and base target of Circle, because a ward with these parameters wards against creatures with a Might equal to or less than or equal to its level. The parameters of the spell can be changed in the normal way, so that a ward which only protected the magus (Range Personal, Target Individual) for a duration of Moon would have the same final level.

Like any Hermetic spell, wards must Penetrate Magic Resistance to have their effect. A spell like Circular Ward Against Demons is much harder to cast

at high levels, since the spell level must equal or exceed any affected demon's Might Score, and the Penetration Total must exceed it. For this reason, magi rarely learn or cast versions of these spells more powerful than about Level 30, instead favoring Rego spells of lower levels that hinder the target's movements more directly. Since in most cases Hermetic wards do not actually target the creatures affected by them, most magi cannot boost their Penetration Total with an Arcane Connection to a supernatural being, unless that being is inside the circle when the ward is cast.

== Magical Craft ==

Hermetic magic can create a wide range of things. Natural objects, such as boulders, plants, or animals, can be created with Creo magic. Unless the caster botches the spell, the result is always a good example of that sort of thing. The caster may make an Intelligence + Finesse roll to add or control details, such as the shape of a tree's branches or the color of an animal's fur, within the normal range for such things. A failure on the Finesse roll just means that the caster does not get the desired details; the created thing is still a good example of the sort of thing it is. Even a botch on the Finesse roll does not make the creation a bad example of what it is, but it does create something as far from the caster's desire as possible. If she was trying to create a tree to block a hole in a wall, for example, a botched Finesse roll might mean that the tree makes more of the wall collapse, making the hole even larger and easier to get through. The tree, however, is still a perfectly good tree.

Artificial items, such as tables, robes, and buildings, are a bit more complex. They can be created from nothing, using Creo magic, or from raw materials, using Rego magic. The advantage of working with natural raw materials is that a Momentary spell creates a lasting item: the changes are made in a moment, but the raw materials do not change back when the spell expires. An item made with Creo only lasts for the duration of the spell, unless the spell was a Momentary Ritual.

Rego magic is the most straightforward. The spell rearranges the target materials in the same way as a craftsman, making a new item. Nothing is created or destroyed (without appropriate requisites), and the final product must be stable by itself. A single spell has a single effect, such as turning iron ore into finished iron ingots and slag, and does not need any tools that are not incorporated into the final product. The target of the spell is the raw materials, which means that it normally has to be Group; there are exceptions, such as a spell to create a sculpture from a block of stone. The caster must adapt the spell to the materials on hand in every case, which requires a Perception + Finesse roll. The base Ease Factor for this roll is 3 greater than the Ease Factor for a mundane craftsman carrying out the same task. If the spell covers more than one mundane task, use the highest mundane Ease Factor to calculate the base. This is also modified by the length of time the task would normally take. The base Ease Factor covers up to one day's work for one craftsman, but longer periods of work increase the Ease Factor. This can represent one craftsman working for longer, or many craftsmen working at the same time.

<blockquote>Rego Craft Magic Roll: Perception + Finesse
</blockquote>
Base Ease Factor: Highest Ease Factor for a Mundane Craftsman + 3

One day's work for one craftsman is +0 One month's work for one craftsman is +3 One season's work for one craftsman is +6 One year's work for one craftsman is +9

One month's work for one craftsman is equivalent to thirty craftsmen all working for a single day, or two working for about two weeks, and so on. It is possible to create a spell that turns iron ore that is still in the ground into finished swords, but that would be at least a season's worth of work by various craftsmen, and thus would have a high Ease Factor.

If the Finesse roll fails, the materials are still rearranged, but not into anything useful. The remaining pieces may well be too small to repeat

the spell, but that is up to the troupe to decide. On a botch, the result normally looks right, but has a hidden and fatal flaw.

Creo craft magic is a little more involved. A spell creates a functioning version of whatever is intended, just as for natural objects. This is equivalent to a work of craft with an Ease Factor of 6. However, if the caster relies on this and does not make a Finesse roll, they have no control over the details. A Spontaneous spell creates a random instance of the sort of thing, which means that clothes, for example, may well not fit the intended target. A Formulaic or Ritual spell creates exactly the same thing every time.

When casting a Spontaneous spell, the caster may choose to make an Intelligence + Finesse roll to define the details. The most basic details have an Ease Factor of 0, for example to fix the approximate size of clothes. Fixing two or three basic details, or making more specific changes, has an Ease Factor of 3. If the specification is quite elaborate, use the same Ease Factors as for Rego craft magic.

A Formulaic or Ritual spell can be designed to allow the caster to make certain changes to the product, although this normally adds magnitudes to the spell level to account for the complexity. For example, ''Conjuring the Mystic Tower'' allows the caster to determine the layout of chambers within the tower. Simple decisions have an Ease Factor of 0, while more complex ones have higher Ease Factors. Splitting each floor of the mystic tower in two would have an Ease Factor of 0, but creating elaborate mazes would have a much higher Ease Factor, possibly 12. The caster can only change the elements that the spell design allows for; the caster cannot change the height or diameter of the mystic tower, for example.

A Finesse roll also allows the caster to create higher quality items, using the same Ease Factors as for Rego craft magic. A Formulaic or Ritual spell may be designed to allow for this, but this should add at least three magnitudes to the base level, as it creates a lot of flexibility.

Creo Craft Magic Roll: Intelligence + Finesse

Fix a Single Property: Ease Factor 0

Fix Two or Three Properties, or Fix One Precisely: Ease Factor 3

Elaborate Modifications: Same Ease Factor as Rego Craft Magic

Botching the Finesse roll for Creo craft magic creates something that hinders the caster, and it might be so badly designed that most people would have trouble saying what it was supposed to be.

No matter how much flexibility is added to a Formulaic or Ritual spell, it can still only create one type of thing, such as a sword or a stone tower.

Note that Rego craft magic uses Perception + Finesse, while Creo craft magic uses Intelligence + Finesse. This is because Rego craft magic must work with existing materials, which means that the caster must be sensitive to their properties. Creo craft magic, in contrast, creates its own materials, which means that the caster must understand how the materials need to be to achieve the desired result.

More details about crafting with magic can be found in Covenants, page 49, and Houses of Hermes: Societates, pages 60–62.

<span id="summoning-spirits"></span>
=== Summoning Spirits ===

Hermetic magic is capable of summoning spirits. Such magic brings the spirit instantly to the caster, but does not grant any control — other magic may be used for those purposes, and a spirit may be summoned directly into a ward cast by the summoner. (Wards cast by anyone else affect the spirit as normal, and may keep the spirit out if it is not powerful enough to cross the ward.) Summoning spells are normally cast at Arcane Connection range, making them quite high level.

If the target spirit is in Mythic Europe, a Formulaic (or Spontaneous) spell is sufficient. If the spirit is in another realm, such as the Magic Realm, Arcadia, Purgatory, or Hell, the spell must be a Ritual. (The Limit of the Divine, and possibly the Limit of the Lunar Sphere, puts Heaven out of reach.) Regiones count as part of Mythic Europe for these purposes, and it is important to note that a lot of spirits, including demons, spend most of their time in Mythic Europe.

<span id="gase-factors-for-greating-and-grafting-objects"></span>
== Gase Factors for Greating and Grafting Objects ==

The Ease Factors in the table below include the +3 adjustment for magic use, and assume that a mundane craftsman could complete the work in no more than a day. City and Guild contains more extensive rules for mundane craft (Chapter 4), and Art and Academe contains more rules for art (Chapter 8), which can be used to set more precise Ease Factors if the troupe desires. If you are using Workshop Totals from City and Guild, generate the equivalent Finesse Ease Factor by adding 3 to the Workshop Total, and then any modifiers for extra time required.

<span id="container-targets"></span>
== Container Targets ==

pells with container Targets, including Circle, Room, Structure, and Boundary, raise a number of specific issues.

<span id="static-and-dynamic-targets"></span>
== Static and Dynamic Targets ==

Spells with container Targets, including Circle, Room, Structure, and Boundary, can work in one of

First, they can affect any valid target within the Target container at the time of casting, and continue to affect those targets even if they leave the original target area. The effects continue even if the target container ceases to exist, for as long as the spell lasts (Circles are an exception, and spells of this type with Circle Targets end if the circle is broken). It does not affect anything that enters the target container later, even if the spell is still in effect. This is the way that spells with object Targets work, and can be referred to as a static target, because the things targeted by the spell are fixed when the spell is cast, and do not change.

Second, they can affect any valid target within the Target container during the spell's period of effect. In this case, a valid target that leaves the container ceases to be affected by the spell, and a valid target that enters (or re-enters) the container is affected, until it leaves or the spell expires. In this case, the spell ends if the container ceases to exist, even if it has duration left. This can be referred to as a dynamic target, because the things that are targeted by the spell can change over the duration.

The way that a particular spell works is fixed when it is designed, and cannot be changed by the casting magus, although a spell working in one way is similar to a spell that is identical apart from working in the other, and so knowledge of one gives a bonus to inventing the other.

For example, a spell to put pink dots on people's foreheads with Target Room and Duration Moon could work in two ways. In the static version, everyone in the room (on whom the spell Penetrates) at the time of casting gets a pink dot on their forehead, and this pink dot remains on their forehead until the new moon and full moon have both set, no matter what happens to the room. In the dynamic version, anyone who is inside the room (on whom the spell Penetrates) until the new moon and full moon have both set gets a pink dot on their forehead, even if they were not in the room when the spell was cast. When they leave the room, the pink dot disappears, although it reappears if they go back into the room. If the room ceases to exist before the duration expires, the spell ends early. These two versions are two different spells, and a maga who wants to cast both (and cannot reliably cast them spontaneously) needs to create two spells.

<span id="being-inside-a-container"></span>
== Being Inside a Container ==

The standard Ars Magica rules use an intuitive definition of &quot;inside' when determining whether something is within a container target. A person standing in the centre of a 1 pace diameter circle is inside the circle; someone who happens to be standing directly above it three floors higher is not. A person standing on the battlements of a castle is within the Structure, but a crow flying over

the walls is not. If your troupe needs a more precise definition. you can work something out, and nothing should break.

<span id="persistence-of-containers"></span>
=== Persistence of Containers ===

The standard Ars Magica rules also use an intuitive definition of whether a container still exists to be the target of a spell. If the same container still exists, then the target still exists. An island does not cease to exist when the tide rises or falls, unless a causeway ioins it to the mainland at low tide. A room does not cease to exist when the door is opened, but a room inside a tent does cease to exist when the tent is packed away. Containers can move if they are still the same thing while, and after, moving. Note that certain choices of container make spells vulnerable: if a Room is just a tent, the spell can be ended by collapsing the tent, while if a Boundary is just a fence, the spell can be ended by pulling down any part of the fence. Containers can get larger or smaller, but spells do end if the container becomes too big for the spell to affect.

Circles and Boundaries require some extra comment. A circle is a different circle if its size changes, or if it is transferred to a different surface. Circles are very vulnerable, which offsets the power of Ring Duration and Circle Target. If a Boundary is nothing more than the thing marking the border, then it is as vulnerable as a circle, and cannot be moved, altered, or expanded. If a Boundary is something like &quot;the waterline of this island&quot; or &quot;the wall around this covenant&quot;, then it is much less vulnerable, and may change with natural changes in the thing.

<span id="targets-and-sizes"></span>
== Targets and Sizes ==

The Ars Magica spell Targets depend on the kind of thing that the target is, not how big it is. A pebble and one of the stones at Stonehenge are both Individuals, and the inside of a tiny hut and the nave of a cathedral are both Rooms.

However, the size of the target does make a difference to the level of the spell, with the exceptions of Intellego magic and Circle Targets. Every Form has a base size for Individual targets, and targets of that size or less can be affected by a spell of the basic level. Adding one magnitude (five levels) to the spell multiplies the maximum size of its target by ten. This depends on the mass or volume of the target, so a five level boost to a Corpus spell would allow the magus to affect a giant up to fifteen feet tall, not sixty feet tall. A spell designed to affect a certain size of target can affect any target up to that size. However, it is not possible to invent lower level spells that affect smaller targets; the level of the spell to affect the base target is an absolute lower limit.

This rule should not be applied with absolute mathematical precision. A rough guess by the storyguide is fine, as long as the troupe agrees. In the event of disagreement, however, a precise calculation can be made to resolve the issue, although as this takes time it is probably best reserved for working out exactly what a Formulaic spell can do.

A Part targeted by a spell can be up to the size of the base Individual. Again, every magnitude added increases the size that can be affected by a factor of ten. Note that a spell to affect an Individual is five levels lower than a spell to affect a Part of the same size.

A base Group contains about as much mass or volume as ten standard Individuals of the Form. This can be split up in any way desired, so it could be two Individuals, each of five times standard size, or ten Individuals of standard size, or ten thousand individuals, each one thousandth of standard size. Every five levels added multiplies the size affected by a factor of ten. Note that a spell to affect a large Individual is five levels lower than a spell to affect a Group of the same total mass.

A base Room is large enough to fit a hundred standard Individuals with some squashing. For Corpus, this means that a base room is about four hundred square feet in area. Because the Room already exists to create a boundary, this is easier than affecting a Group, and a spell to affect a number of Individuals within a Room can be lower level than a spell to affect an Individual of similar size. Note also that, because a Room cannot be internally divided without becoming two Rooms, the height of the ceiling does not normally matter. For every five levels added to the spell level, the area of the Room is multiplied by ten.

A base Structure contains ten base Rooms, spread over one or more floors. For every five levels added the size of the Structure is increased by a factor of ten.

A base Boundary is the same for all Forms, and is one hundred paces (three hundred feet) in diameter. As for Rooms, every five levels added multiplies the area by ten, or the diameter by a little over three.

Each Target level includes all of the possible sizes of that target, even though the spell level changes. The size of the target can be manipulated in the same

way as the Target parameter, whether through Virtues, MuVi, or other techniques, but these are all changes within the same type of Target. For example, a Target Individual spell with +2 magnitudes for size, to affect an Individual 100 times the normal size, has the same Target parameter as a Target Individual spell with no magnitudes added for size.

If a spell makes changes to a target that mean that the size of the applicable base Individual changes, the spell level must be able to affect both the initial and final form. This is most likely to be an issue when the final form has a smaller base Individual.

When changing the size of a non-living target, the base guideline is for a spell that enlarges a target of the base size by a factor of up to ten, or shrinks it by a factor of up to 100. Adding a magnitude to the guideline allows the spell to enlarge the target by a further factor of ten (for a total of 100 times larger), or shrink it by a further factor of 100 (for a total of 10,000 times smaller). Modifications for the size of the original target are in addition to these modifiers, so that a spell to shrink an individual ten times larger than a base Individual by a factor of 10,000 would be two magnitudes higher than the guideline given for changing the size of the target. Forms dealing with living targets have their own guidelines, for living targets, a change of 3 Size points is roughly equivalent to a change by a factor of ten.

Intellego spells are not affected by Target size.

<span id="targets-and-greo"></span>
== Targets and Greo ==

The target of a Creo spell that actually creates something is the thing created. The Target is thus always Individual or Group. A spell to create a part of something is either a healing spell or a Muto spell, depending on the part created. A Creo spell with Target Room cannot be used to fill a room with something. Instead, use Target Group with an appropriate size modifier.

The Creo guidelines for each Form give the level required to create different kinds of thing. The size is determined using the standard rules for target sizes.

<span id="volumes-and-targets"></span>
=== Volumes and Targets ===

Each increase in size on this list indicates a ten-fold increase in volume, and thus a 1 magnitude increase in spell level.

<span id="ritual-spells"></span>
== Ritual Spells ==

Ritual spells take longer to cast than Formulaic spells and require vis. However, they do have some advantages.

* Formulaic and Spontaneous spells may not have Year duration
* Formulaic and Spontaneous spells may not have Boundary target. They may have Vision target, if they are magical sense spells.
* Formulaic and Spontaneous spells may not have a level greater than 50. (Note that they may have a level of 50, but not 51 or higher.)

In addition, other features of a spell may require a Ritual.

* If the guideline requires a Ritual, the spell must be a Ritual.
* If the spell is a Momentary Creo spell creating a lasting thing, it must be a Ritual.
* If the effect of the spell is, in the troupe's judgement, so spectacular that it must not be easily accessible to magi, then the spell must be a Ritual. The guidelines are designed so that such spells will normally be over level 50, and thus Rituals anyway, but not all troupes will agree with all cases.

Ritual spells are always at least level 20, even if the level calculation would make them lower.

It is never possible to replicate the effects of a Ritual spell with Spontaneous magic, even when casting Ceremonially.

<span id="requisites"></span>
== Requisites ==

Most spells involve a simple combination of two Arts, one Form and one Technique. Some spells, however, involve more than two. For instance, a spell that turns a human into a bird uses Muto because you are transforming something, Corpus because you are affecting a human body, and Animal because you are turning the human body into an animal body. In addition to involving the two primary Arts — Corpus and Muto in this case — casting the spell concerns your Animal score as well. This third Art is a requisite.

There are two kinds of requisite. The first simply allows the spell to have its effect. This includes the Animal requisite on a spell to turn a person into a bird. These requisites do not add to the spell level, as the difficulty of doing such a thing is already accounted for in the guidelines.

The second adds an effect to a spell. In this case, the base Arts and level for the spell are those for the highest-level effect it has. For example, a magic item that changes a picture to show what is happening at a distant location is an Intellego Imaginem spell with a Muto requisite, not a Muto Imaginem spell with an Intellego requisite, as the Intellego effect is of much higher level.

As a general rule of thumb, if the spell would still do something without the requisite, but it would do significantly less, then each requisite adds at least one magnitude to the level of the spell. Thus, the Herbam and Terram requisites that allow a spell to change a clothed man into a bird do not add any levels, because they do not significantly increase the power of the spell. However, a Rego requisite added to a Creo Ignem spell to prevent the fire from burning the caster would require additional levels. In addition, a

single spell that could turn a human into a wolf, or a wolf into a human, would require an additional magnitude for the Animal requisite, as without it the spell could only effect the transformation in one direction. Most such requisites add only a single magnitude to the spell level, but if the additional effect is sixth magnitude or above, it is often appropriate to add two magnitudes.

Additional effects may not require a requisite if they are purely cosmetic. Thus, a spell that creates fire that looks like flaming skulls does not require an Imaginem requisite. A spell that allowed the caster to choose how the fire looked would, because that flexibility is more than a cosmetic effect.

Requisites, if any, are listed for each formulaic spell. (See the spell Curse of Circe on page 334 as an example.) Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have wider knowledge. You must use the lesser of your score in the requisite and your score in the spell's main Technique or Form — Technique if the requisite is a Technique, Form if the requisite is a Form. For example, if you have the scores Animal 6 and Corpus 13, and you cast the Muto Corpus spell Curse of Circe, which has a requisite of Animal, you treat your Corpus score as if it were only 6. Note that if your requisite happened to be higher (for example, if your Animal were 15), you would use the lower basic form (your Corpus of 13 in this case).

Sometimes a spell has a requisite for both its Technique and Form. You must use the lowest in each case. And, if several requisites apply to the same primary Art (for example, if there are two Form requisites), your effective score is the lowest of the group. Furthermore, any Deficiencies you have with an Art apply when you use that Art as a requisite.

Requisites listed with a spell's statistics apply when you are learning, inventing, or casting that spell, but do not apply for other purposes, such as determining the defender's Magic Resistance. The defender's Magic Resistance is determined by the spell's primary Form, not that listed as a requisite, even if the caster's requisite Form score is lower than that of his primary Form score, and thus determines the Casting Total. Similarly, a spell can only be boosted by vis that matches the primary Technique or Form, and effects that affect spells based on their Arts rely on the primary Arts.

Requisite Necessary for Spell's Effect: +0 magnitudes

Requisite Enhances Spell's Effect: +1 magnitude or more

Added Effect is Purely Cosmetic: No requisite

<span id="casting-requisites"></span>
== Casting Requisites ==

Some requisites are not listed along with a spell's statistics because they only apply when the spell is being used in a certain way, not when learning or inventing it. These are called casting requisites. You choose which Arts you use as casting requisites when casting the spell, so what you can affect is limited by your choice. The lowest Technique score and Form score among the primary Arts and all the chosen casting requisites are the ones you use when you cast the spell.

<span id="spontaneous-requisites"></span>
== Spontaneous Requisites ==

Requisites work the same way for spontaneous spells. When the Arts to be used are determined, determine whether requisites are involved. If so, they limit your Arts just as they do for Formulaic spells.

<span id="spell-format"></span>
== Spell Format ==

Each spell has several factors that describe it for game use. They are discussed below.

<span id="technique-and-form"></span>
== Technique and Form ==

The Technique and Form are listed in the heading the spell is found under. Spells are arranged first by their Forms, then by their Techniques, in alphabetical order. Following each Technique/Form heading are guidelines that will help you create your own spells, as well as help you determine the necessary level to cast a Spontaneous spell.

The base Range, Duration, and Target for almost all guidelines are the lowest categories: Personal, Momentary, Individual. Thus, a useful spell will often be of significantly higher level than the guideline for that effect, because it has a higher Range, Duration, and Target. There are some exceptions, primarily guidelines for wards, and these are noted explicitly in the guideline. If the guideline does not specify a Range, Duration, or Target, they are Personal, Momentary, and Individual.

Techniques and Forms are often abbreviated by the first two letters of each word; thus a MuTe spell is of Muto Technique and Terram Form. The level is often added after the abbreviation

* thus Flash of the Scarlet Flames

<span id="title"></span>
== Title ==

The titles given are the actual names of spells as known by Hermetic magi. When inventing new spells, try to give them creative names that will add color to the game. &quot;Fireball&quot; is not interesting; &quot;Ball of Abysmal Flame&quot; is — you get the idea.

<span id="level"></span>
== Level ==

Most spells are assigned a level, which is usually a multiple of five. It need not be, however, and magi may well invent spells of intermediate levels. Spontaneous spells often have other levels, as well.

Some spells are General spells (abbreviated to Gen), which means that they may be learned at any level of difficulty-the higher the level, the more powerful the spell.

The level at which you know a General level Formulaic or Ritual spell depends on where you obtained it. If you learned a General level spell that was designed for effectiveness at level 15, then that is the level at which you know it. You cannot produce effects

that exceed level 15 effects with that spell unless you invent a version with a higher level or learn such a version

General level spells are open-ended only in the sense that they may be learned at any level. They may not be used at a level higher (or lower) than that which is known, and different levels of a General level spell are still different spells.

<span id="ritual"></span>
== Ritual ==

Spells requiring rituals are those that fall outside the categories listed for Formulaic and Spontaneous spells described under &quot;Ritual Spells&quot; on page 213. Certain powerful spells and spells inherited from the Cult of Mercury are also Ritual spells. Storyguides should use their discretion in declaring other spells Ritual.

<span id="requisites-1"></span>
== Requisites ==

Requisites make it more difficult to cast spells, as they demand the caster have greater knowledge. See &quot;Requisites&quot; on page 311 for a full description of how they limit the casters of particular spells. Requisites that always apply are listed along with a spell's statistics. Casting requisites are listed within the body of the spell description.

<span id="description"></span>
== Description ==

Describes the effects of the spell. Descriptions cover about 95% of the circumstances in which spells are used, but since magic is variable, unpredictable, and can be used in a number of ways, the responsibility for determining the effects in unusual situations lies with the storyguide.

Some of the spell descriptions include visual descriptions, hand gestures, and wizard's sigils. It should be noted that these are all examples and that you shouldn't feel bound by them. In fact, you should customize all your spells in ways appropriate to your own magus. When you give special details to your own customized versions of these spells, you are rewarded with a more interesting game.

<span id="design"></span>
== Design ==

A parenthetical line at the end of the description gives the calculations for the spell level. The base level is given in levels, and other modifications in magnitudes. Remember that adding a magnitude adds one level up to level five, and five levels thereafter.

<span id="spell-damage"></span>
== Spell Damage ==

Many spells have damage listed in the form +X. This is an abbreviation for stress die + X. The damage inflicted by such spells varies from one casting to another. The target resists this damage with their Soak Total + stress die.

<span id="the-wizards-sigil"></span>
== The Wizard's Sigil ==

When you invent a spell, some amount of your personal magical style is likely to manifest itself, giving the spell some small quirk or minor detail that identifies it as yours. This recurrent mark or quirk in a magus's spell (which doesn't usually change the effectiveness of the spell) is termed his &quot;wizard's sigil.&quot; Once known, these quirks can identify certain magi as having cast certain spells. Throughout this chapter, various sample spell sigils are listed in the descriptions. Keep in mind that these are just guidelines. They're meant to give you ideas to better personalize your spells, and perhaps to aid you in choosing your own sigil. See page 224 in the Hermetic Magic chapter for further details.

Note that even when you learn a spell from another magus, or from a lab text, you are actually inventing it, with guidance, so it is always your sigil that manifests in your spells.

<span id="animal-spells"></span>
== Animal Spells ==

Animal spells affect all natural living things that are not plants or humans, doing to animals what Mentem and Corpus spells do to people. Animal spells may affect any animal-like mind or body. They also affect things made with animal products, such as leather, bone, or wool.

To tell if an Animal spell will affect the mind of a creature, determine from the animal's Characteristics if it has Cunning or Intelligence. If the creature has Intelligence, a Mentem spell must be used. If it has Cunning, an Animal spell must be used. When a creature or person who has an Intelligence Characteristic is shapechanged, Animal spells that affect the mind are not effective. Instead, Mentem spells are needed. However, the body of such a being may be affected by Animal spells, including spells like ''The Falcon's Hood'' (PeAn 20).

If a human body has animal parts (such as bat wings), those parts can be affected by Animal spells, even though the rest of the body is only affected by Corpus spells.

A Bjornaer magus in animal form is truly an animal, so his mind is affected by Animal spells rather than Mentem spells, and his body by Animal spells rather than Corpus spells. However, spells with continuing effects cast on one form continue to affect the other. Most shapechangers do not change their essential nature, which remains human, so their bodies can still be affected by Corpus spells, as well as by Animal.

A basic Individual for Animal is an animal of about the same size as a pony, Size +1 or lower.

<span id="orco-animal-guidelines"></span>
==== Orco Animal Guidelines ====

Most Animal spells cannot be used with Personal range, so the level of a spell must be higher than the guidelines given.

To create treated animal products (like leather, jointed meat, and cloth) add one magnitude to the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of dead animal. To create treated and processed animal products, such as a leather jacket or a woolen tunic, add two magnitudes to

Level 1: • Give an animal a +1 bonus to Recovery rolls

Give an animal a +3 bonus to Recovery rolls. Preserve a corpse from decay.

Treserve a corpse from acca,

Level 3: • Give an animal a +6 bonus to Recovery rolls.

Level 4: • Give an animal a +9 bonus to Recovery rolls.

Level 5: • Create an animal product, such as spidersilk or wool. (Note that an Individual is a single hair, a single hide, or a single tusk.)

• Create an insect or similar bug.

• Give an animal a +12 bonus to Recovery rolls.

Level 10: • Create the corpse of an animal.

• Create a bird, reptile, fish, or amphibian.

• Give an animal a +15 bonus to Recovery rolls.

Level 15: • Heal a Light Wound.

• Give an animal a +18 bonus to Recovery rolls.

• Create a mammal

Cause an animal to reach full maturity over the course of a single day or night. This accelerated maturation only applies during the spell's Duration, and thus full effect requires a Sun Duration spell cast early in the day or night.

Level 20: • Heal a Medium Wound

Give an animal a +21 bonus to Recovery rolls

• Cause an animal to reach full maturity over the course of about two hours

Level 25: • Stop the progress of a disease.

• Heal a Heavy Wound.

• Restore a lost sense.

• Restore a lost limb.

• Cure a disease, counteracting its effects. (Unless cast as a Momentary Ritual, this is the same as stopping the progress of a disease.)

Cause an animal to reach full maturity over the course of ten Diameters (twenty minutes). the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of dead animal.

In order to influence the behavior of created animals, a Rego requisite is required, and as this is an additional effect it adds at least one magnitude to the spell level. Otherwise they just do what comes naturally.

Creo Animal botches often produce the wrong sort of animal, or produce an animal enraged with the caster.

Level 30: • Heal an Incapacitating Wound.

• Increase one of an animal's Characteristics by one point, to no more than the average score for that kind of animal.

• Cause an animal to reach full maturity over the course of a single Diameter.

Level 35: • Heal all wounds.

• Increase one of an animal's Characteristics by one point, to no more than one higher than the average score for that kind of animal.

Level 40: • Increase one of an animal's

Characteristics by one point, to no more than two higher than the average score for that kind of animal.

• Cause an animal to reach full maturity in a moment.

Level 45: • Increase one of an animal's

Characteristics by one point, to no more than three higher than the average score for that kind of animal.

Level 50: • Create a magical beast. When creating a magical creature, the Magic Might of the creature cannot exceed the level of the spell, and requisites must be included for any special powers (for example, Ignem if it can breathe fire, Rego and Mentem if it can control people's minds). A Vim requisite, for the magical nature, is always required.

• Increase one of an animal's Characteristics by one point, to no more than four higher than the average score for that kind of animal

Level 55: • Increase one of an animal's

Characteristics by one point, to no more than five higher than the average score for that kind of animal. A greater\nincrease is not within the natural range for the animal, and thus cannot be\neffected by Creo magic.

Level 75: • Raise an animal from the dead.

SOOTHE PAINS OF THE BEAST

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

This spell looks much like a ritualistic &quot;laying on of hands&quot; seen in many churches. You kneel and press your hands to the wound while reciting a quiet incantation. The spell cures one Light Wound suffered by the animal.

Asaron of Flambeau believes his mission in life is to repopulate the world so there will be more to kill, and thus spends seasons healing animals and people throughout Europe. In his version of this spell, a black patch in the shape of a tongue of fire is left where the wound was. A symbolic flame is seen in almost all of Asaron's spells, making it his wizard's sigil.

(Base level 15, +1 Touch)

TRUE REST OF THE INJURED BRUTE R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind

The injured target gets a +9 bonus to all Recovery rolls made while the spell is in effect.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon)

LEVEL 35

WEAVER'S TRAP OF WEBS

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

In casting this spell, you point and from the indicated initial location, a huge net of spider webs grows, filling an area 5 paces by 5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports, the webs can hang vertically, forming a wall; otherwise they act like a net. When the webs are through growing after a few seconds, they are as thick as string and as strong as iron. Everyone caught in the area of the webs is immobilized. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll of 12+, or someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Contrary to widespread rumor, fire is ineffective against these webs. Webs may continue to trap victims in the

future, as long as the spell lasts and they aren't completely hacked apart.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +2 Group (total mass of the spiderwebs is still less than ten basic Individuals, so no size adjustment))

THE WIZARD'S MOUNT

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Creates a horse, which is normal in every way except that it is not disturbed by The Gift.

(Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 size)

LEVEL 50

CURSE OF THE RAVENOUS SWARM

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Group, Ritual

Req: Rego

Calls a swarm of locusts or other destructive insects upon an area, which destroys wild plant life and fields. When the spell's duration ends, all the insects disappear, leaving nothing but the damage. The Rego requisite ensures that the insects only devastate the area desired by the caster.

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +2 Group, +2 size, for a swarm weighing as much as one thousand pigs, +1 extra effect from requisite, ritual because it has a really major effect)

<span id="intellego-animal-spells"></span>
== Intellego Animal Spells ==

LEVEL 5

IMAGE OF THE BEAST

R: Arc D: Mom, T: Ind

Gives you a hazy mental image of an animal you have an Arcane Connection to.

Wounds caused by an animal are an Arcane Connection to that animal with a lifetime of a few hours. This spell can thus be used to find out what was responsible for an attack.

All spells cast by Chavin of Tytalus can be recognized because they promote or advocate war or violence. In his version of this spell, the claws and teeth of the beast appear more dangerous.

(Base 1, +4 Arcane Connection)

<span id="intellego-animal-guidelines"></span>
== Intellego Animal Guidelines ==

When you try to get information from an animal, remember that its memories are gathered through its particular senses, with their particular strengths and weaknesses. For example, dogs remember much about odors of various things, but often forget details of how they looked. Animals do not remember human words, but might remember tone of voice and such. You may not get the exact information you are looking for.

To communicate with an animal, you must bring yourself to the animal's mental level — a process that might have strange, though temporary, effects on you. For example, you might have a craving for raw meat or speak very slowly for a moment after communicating with a bear.

Since Animal includes aspects of both Corpus and Mentem with regard to beasts, guidelines that apply to the latter two may apply to Animal. InCo and InMe may be referred to for additional ideas.

Botches with InAn normally result in false information.

Level 1: • Get a mental image of an animal.

Level 3: • Sense the state of consciousness of a beast.

• Get general information about an animal's body.

Level 4: • Sense the dominant drive of a beast.

Learn a specific fact about an animal's body.

Level 5: • Learn the origin, age, and history of something made of animal products

Level 10: • Speak with an animal.

• Read an animal's surface thoughts.

Level 15: • Read the recent memories of a beast.

Level 20: • Thoroughly probe the mind of a beast.

<span id="muto-animal-guidelines"></span>
=== Muto Animal Guidelines ===

Animals granted new abilities, such as wings, will need a few minutes to get used to them. When transforming things, you can transform things that they are carrying with appropriate requisites. For example, you could transform a horse and its armor with a Terram requisite.

Animals are not infinitely mutable, and using too many of these spells for too long on an animal can warp its natural constitution and even destroy it. Muto Corpus spells may be examined to get additional ideas and guidelines for Muto Animal Spells. Common sigils seen in Muto Animal spells involve animals being changed in some strange way. Beasts transformed by Julian of Flambeau, with ''The Beast Remade'' (MuAn 25), might have bright red hair in their new form, while toads created by Silva of Merinita, with ''Transformation of the Ravenous Beast to the Torpid Toad'' (MuAn 30), might have a comical coloration.

MuAn botches often change the caster instead of the target, or change the target in a way very different from that intended.

* Level 1: Make a superficial change to something made of animal products (like changing its color).
* Level 2: Make a major change to something made of animal products that preserves the substance (for example, turn a leather jerkin into a saddle).
** Make a superficial change to a beast
* Level 3: Change an animal's limb.
** Change something made of animal products into a different animal product.
* Level 4: Make a major change in a beast, while leaving it recognizably the same sort of animal (for example, make a horse bigger and change its color).
** Change something made of animal products in a minor unnatural way.
* Level 5: Change an animal into a different animal.
** Change an animal in a minor way so that it is no longer natural (for example, change the color of a horse's coat to match the covenant's coat of arms).
** Change something made of animal products in a major unnatural way.
* Level 10: Change an animal into a human (though it retains its animal mentality and does not gain a soul, requires a Corpus requisite).
** Change an animal into a plant (requires a Herbam requisite).
* Level 15: Change an animal in a major unnatural way (for example, give a horse claws, fangs, and scaly armored skin).
** Change an animal into a non-living item (appropriate requisite required).
* Level 25: Radically change an animal in an unnatural way (for example, give a horse wings). Give an animal a 'magical' ability, such as the ability to breathe fire (requires a requisite for the ability).

SHIVER OF THE LYCANTHROPE

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Touch

You feel a sudden shiver if you are touching a person or beast that is actually a lycanthrope. Variants of this spell detect other types of shapechanger, but not Bjornaer with Heartbeasts.

(Base 4, +1 Concentration, +1 Touch)

<span id="level-25"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

OPENING THE TOME OF THE ANIMAL'S MIND

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

You touch the head of the animal in question and read its memories of the past day. The further the animal is from human, the harder it is to read its memories accurately. If you simply scan the beast's memories, not looking for anything special, you get the memories the beast thinks are most important. If you are trying to get a specific fact, you need a Perception + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6, or 12 if the fact is obscure. Since normal animals are sensitive to magic, they resist your touch and try to shy away from you both when the spell is cast and while the spell continues to function. This can be quite a problem with larger animals.

(Base 15, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration)

<span id="level-30"></span>
==== LEVEL 30 ====

HUNTER'S SENSE

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Hearing

You sense the shapes and primary motivations of all animals above a certain size that you can hear, or could hear if they were making a noise. You decide the size threshold when you cast the spell, such as &quot;all animals larger than a fox.&quot; The 'noise' of an animal's shape is louder the larger it is, while the 'noise' of its motivations increases depending on how intense the motivation is. A rabbit fleeing from a fox would sound fearful, very loudly. The fox's motivation might be fairly quiet, especially if recent hunting had been good.

(Base 4, +2 Sun, +3 Hearing, +1 for shape and primary motivation)

==== LEVEL 15 ====

BEAST OF OUTLANDISH SIZE

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Changes the Size of an animal by +1. This change modifies Strength by +2, the range for each wound level increases by one, and Quickness falls by one. The new beast is of huge size, and looks much more impressive than its former self. Townspeople may run in fear of it, and there is little doubt among them that it is a creature of magic.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

<span id="doublet-of-impenetrable-silk"></span>
==== DOUBLET OF IMPENETRABLE SILK ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind.

Change an item made of animal material — silk, wool, or leather — so it cannot be cut or penetrated by weapons. A simple cloth doublet becomes the equivalent of armor with no Load and a +3 Soak bonus. Armor made of guilted material or any kind of leather improves its Protection by an additional +3. The magic does not make the armor better at absorbing shock, so this +3 bonus is the limit that can be bestowed without changing the material into something completely different. At the storyguide's option, the bonus given by this spell may not apply against strictly blunt weapons like clubs and staves.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

<span id="growth-of-the-creeping-things"></span>
==== GROWTH OF THE CREEPING THINGS ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind.

Causes an insect, mouse, toad, or other small (Size -8 or smaller) creature to grow to four times its normal size. If it was venomous before, it is even more venomous now. Semi-venomous creatures, like most spiders, have poison with an Ease Factor of 6 that does a Light Wound.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

<span id="level-20"></span>
==== LEVEL 20 ====

<span id="beast-of-minuscule-proportions"></span>
==== BEAST OF MINUSCULE PROPORTIONS ====

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind

Reduces the size of an animal by 2. This modifies Strength by -4, reduces the range for each wound type by two points, and increases Quickness by +2. The beast appears to be the runt of its litter.

(Base: 4, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)

<span id="level-25-1"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

THE BEAST REMADE

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Reg: Corpus

Gives one land beast a human form, though its intellect remains the same. Some feature of the animal is retained in the human form. A former dog might have an exceptionally hairy human body, and a former cat might let loose an occasional &quot;meow.&quot; Once transformed, the beast is disoriented for a while before it becomes used to its new body.

(Base 10, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, no addition for requisite)

<span id="transformation-of-the-ravenous-beast-to-the-torpid-toad"></span>
==== Transformation of the Ravenous BEAST TO THE TORPID TOAD ====

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind

Turns any animal into a toad. A newly created toad will hold a certain terror for peasants and serfs, because many believe toads exude a poisonous substance from their skin.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)

<span id="level-35"></span>
==== LEVEL 35 ====

<span id="steed-of-vengeance"></span>
==== STEED OF VENGEANCE ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind.

Turns a horse into a ferocious magical mount. Its coat becomes a deep black and its eyes a fiery red, its teeth transform into fangs, its hooves become razor-sharp, and it occasionally breathes steam from its mouth — the horse seems a creature from Hell itself. All its Attack rolls get a +5 bonus. The horse tolerates a magus rider. When the spell wears off, the horse must make a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or die from shock.

AGONY OF THE BEAST

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

After you point at the beast and cast this spell, it begins lashing wildly about, upsetting any nearby objects, and howling in great pain. In order to do anything else, the beast must make a Stamina + Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 each round

(Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration)

<span id="perdo-animal-guidelines"></span>
=== Perdo Animal Guidelines ===

There is normally no Soak against Perdo Animal — the magic does not create something that causes damage, it just causes damage. Magic Resistance is the only way to withstand it.

A common sigil among Flambeau magi, and others who cast Perdo spells, is to leave some type of mark with the damage they do.

When inventing new spells, you may wish to consult Perdo Corpus for guidelines and ideas.

PeAn botches might affect the caster, or affect the wrong animal.

Level 2: • Damage something made of animal products.

• Do superficial damage to a Level 3: beast (for example, remove its hair).

• Destroy something made of Level 4: animal products.

<blockquote>• Cause a beast pain, but do no real damage.
</blockquote>
Make a beast lose one Fatigue level.

Level 5: • Injure an animal so that it is hampered, but not damaged. For example, make a horse lame, a bird lose its voice, or weaken the scales of a serpent. This roughly halves the effectiveness of the targeted thing. Recovery as from a Light Wound.

• Destroy an animal's corpse.

• Inflict a Light Wound.

Level 10: • Inflict a Medium Wound.

Level 15: • Destroy one of a beast's minor senses.

• Inflict a Heavy Wound

• Cripple a beast's limb, so that it is unusable but could heal.

• Age a beast by one-twelfth of its natural lifespan. Only affects beasts that have already reached maturity.

Level 20: • Inflict an Incapacitating Wound.

<blockquote>• Destroy or sever a beast's limb, so that it cannot naturally regain it.
</blockquote>
• Destroy one of a beast's major senses.

Level 30: • Kill an animal.

Level 40: • Destroy one property of an animal, such as its weight or aggression.

<span id="rego-animal-guidelines"></span>
== Rego Animal Guidelines ==

You may further refer to Corpus for ideas and guidelines on controlling an animal's body, and Rego Mentem spells for ideas and guidelines on controlling an animal's mind.

Sigils typical in Rego Animal spells are those that cause beasts to act in certain ways.

ReAn botches could put the caster under the control of the animal, or make the animal act in a way opposite to that intended. They could also appear to work, and then suddenly reverse at an extremely inconvenient moment.

* General: Ward against beings associated with Animal from one supernatural realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)
** Create a circle warding against animals from one realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell (Touch, Ring, Circle). Note that animals are not necessarily associated with Animal, or vice versa
* Level 1: • Manipulate items made from animal products
* Level 2: • Plant a single suggestion in the mind of an animal.
** Protect the target from animal attacks (only affects animals without supernatural abilities).

BLUNT THE VIPER'S FANGS R: Voice, D: Momentary,

T: Individual

Blunt the claws, teeth, talons, or other natural weapons of a beast. Only sharp weapons may be affected: this spell does not affect a weapon such as a horse's hoof or a giant snake's coils. The blunted weapon has its total damage (including Attack Advantage) reduced to half (round up). The beast may recover from the effect as if it were a Light Wound. The spell may affect animals of size up to +4.

THE FALCON'S HOOD

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Destroys an animal's vision. The blindness heals as if it is a Medium Wound. The title refers to the hood used to cover a falcon's eyes when it is not hunting.

When cast by Asaron of Flambeau, this spell causes the animals it targets to bear a faint silhouette of a flame in their eves.

(Base 20, +1 Touch)

CRIPPLE THE HOWLING WOLF

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

When casting this spell, you commonly make an abrupt snapping motion with your hands. One of the target's legs breaks cleanly. The animal cannot walk on that leg, but the damage heals as a Medium Wound. Note that the target need not be a wolf, and that you cannot choose which leg.

WARD AGAINST THE BEASTS OF LEGEND R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle

No magical beast whose Magic Might is equal to or less than the level can affect anyone within the Circle

or, if it is within the Circle, affect those outside. When a magus is making this and most other wards, a common gesture employed is the Fig Sign. The magus balls his or her right hand into a fist, placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers. A magus traveling to Italy should be warned that this sign is a deadly insult in that country.

DISGUISE OF THE PUTRID AROMA

R: Voice, D: Conc. T: Ind

The target takes no interest in you as long as you continue to concentrate, and do not threaten it. A carnivore treats you as if you were simply something it does not eat. It retains normal interest, however, in anyone else nearby.

(Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Concentration)

PANIC OF THE ELEPHANT'S MOUSE

R: Eye, D: Conc, T: Ind

Makes an animal afraid of the target by preying upon its instinctive fears, causing it to attempt escape by the quickest, most feasible means possible. The animal may make a Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to resist. (The title refers to the elephant's legendary fear of mice, but note that this spell cannot actually affect elephants, as they are too large.)

R: Eye, D: Conc, T: Ind

Calms an animal, making it nearly fearless. It does not resist being ridden, shaved, or whatever else you can think of. If the animal enters combat, is extremely frightened, or incurs any kind of wound, the spell ends. The animal must be Size +4 or less.

==== MASTERING THE UNRULY BEAST ====

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

You can make an animal perform any act it is capable of. You can only issue new commands while touching the animal, but the animal will carry them out without requiring constant contact. Further, the animal will allow you to touch it throughout the duration of the spell. It is difficult to maintain control of particularly stubborn or fierce animals, such as mules or boars — creatures with appropriate Personality Traits may roll against an Ease Factor of 12 each round.

When Chavin of Tytalus casts this spell, the creature acts surly and unfriendly while going about its tasks, even when Chavin doesn't specifically tell it to act that way.

You implant a complicated command into an animal, which it carries out to the best of its abilities. The command must involve completing a certain task, such as finding a certain person. Vague orders, like &quot;protect me,&quot; do not work. If the animal does not complete the task before the end of the spell approaches, it becomes desperately ferocious, especially at night.

<span id="aquam-spells"></span>
== Aquam Spells ==

Aquam spells affect water and all other liquids. Liquids that are part of a body, particularly a living body, can only be affected by spells designed specifically to do so, with appropriate requisites.

The application of the target categories to Aquam magic is not as obvious as it is for some other Forms, so further guidelines are given here. If the standard targets do apply, they may also be used.

''Individual'': A stretch of water with the same composition and current. A small pond, part of a stream, or a spring.

Part: A part of an Individual. This category applies easily.

''Group'': A number of Individuals. This can include a large river, where there are several different currents, a number of rivers flowing together, or a lake.

Room, Structure and Boundary: work as for other Forms; the spell affects all the liquid within the target area.

A base Individual for Aguam is a pool of water about five paces (fifteen feet) across, and two paces deep at the center. Naturally-occurring liquids, such as fruit juice or olive oil, have a base Individual one-tenth the size, about two paces across and about one deep. Processed liquids, such as wine or beer, have a base Individual one hundredth the size, a pool about one pace across and half a pace deep. Corrosive and otherwise dangerous liquids have a base Individual ten times smaller again, a puddle about half a pace across and about a fifth of a pace deep. Poisons have a base Individual of a single dose.

FOOTSTEPS OF SLIPPERY OIL

R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind

From each of the next ten footsteps the caster of this spell takes, nonflammable grease spreads out, leaving a slick area 10 paces wide. Dexterity stress rolls are required to remain upright whenever a character on the oil does something more

<span id="creo-aquam-guidelines"></span>
== Creo Aquam Guidelines ==

Water created temporarily quenches thirst but provides no lasting benefits to the drinker. It can be used to wash, and the things washed stay clean. Common sigils for Creo Aquam spells include water with a specific scent, color, or flavor.

CrAq botches might create far too much water (think of the Sorcerer's Apprentice), or the wrong kind of liquid.

Slightly unnatural liquids are one magnitude harder than water, very unnatural liquids are two magnitudes harder, and require a Muto requisite.

Poisons created at the guideline level have an Ease Factor of 3. Each magnitude added to the level of the spell adds 3 to the Ease Factor.

* General: Create a corrosive substance doing +(Level) damage. Increasing the range to more than Touch is a very good idea.
* Level 2: Fill a container with water (or some other natural liquid, with appropriate requisites).
* Level 3: Create water (or some other natural liquid) that is not contained (for example, spread over a surface).
** Create ice in a natural shape, such as a floe or icicle.
* Level 4: Create water (or some other natural liquid) in an unnatural shape (for example, in a sphere over someone's head) but water so created will behave normally.
** Create a spring with a low rate of flow.
* Level 5: Create a poison that causes a Light Wound.
** Create a spring with a high rate of flow.
* Level 10: Create a geyser with a very high rate of flow.
** Create poison that causes a Medium Wound.
* Level 15: Create poison that causes a Heavy Wound.
* Level 20: Create a poison that causes an Incapacitating Wound.
* Level 25: Create a poison that causes a Fatal Wound.
** Create a water elemental from a base amount of elemental material. (Ritual)

<span id="intellego-aquam-guidelines"></span>
== Intellego Aquam Guidelines ==

Note that Intellego Aquam spells do not normally require requisites depending on the type of liquid targeted.

Most sigils manifest in Intellego Aquam spells by causing the information to be reported in some slightly quirky way. For example, Chavin of Tytalus's version of ''Voice of the Lake'' always makes the lake sound strong, masculine, and arrogant.

Botched InAq spells generally provide false information.

* Level 1: Make a sense unaffected by water.
* Level 2: Get an image of water within range.
* Level 3: Get an image of water and its immediate surroundings within range.
** Learn the natural properties of a liquid.
* Level 4: Learn the natural properties of a mixture of liquids.
* Level 5: Learn the magical properties of a liquid
* Level 10: Learn the magical properties of a mixture of liquids.
* Level 15: Speak with a natural body of water.
* Level 20: Speak with an artificial body of water (like a fountain).

challenging than walking. A roll against an Ease Factor of 6 is needed for the average maneuver, with Ease Factors of up to 15 needed to (for example) make a right turn at full speed on a smooth, greased surface. The duration is the length of time that the oil lasts.

This spell was invented by a rather good-natured magus, and the gestures associated with the most common variations of the spell are as comical as the effects themselves. You stand first on one leg, and then the other, vigorously rubbing the bottom of each upturned foot, as if spreading on a salve.

==== CREEPING OIL ====

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind

Saturates a porous material with flammable oil. When casting this spell, you make a flicking motion with your index finger and thumb, as if propelling something at the target. A dot of oil appears on the target after the spell is finished, and slowly spreads over the target, saturating enough cloth to cover a person. If used on a person's clothes and ignited, the oil does +12 damage the first round, +6 the second, and +0 the third.

MIGHTY TORRENT OF WATER

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

A 3-foot-diameter jet of water sprays from your outstretched arms towards your target. The target of this gusher of water takes +10 damage and must make a Strength + Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or be sent flying back.

Marbaid of Flambeau's wizard's sigil is connected to his obsession with blood. In his version of the spell the target is hit by a gush of blood, and the stains do not go away until sunrise/sunset. This does not require a requisite, as it is a purely cosmetic effect.

DELUGE OF RUSHING AND DASHING

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Causes a stream to flood, starting at the stream's nearest point to you and continuing downstream. The results of this spell are generally quite impressive. As the stream overflows its original bed, it becomes a raging torrent, sucking in everything near it. Damage from the spell can last for many years.

As long as you concentrate, the stream remains at flood levels. Anyone caught near the stream when it floods is struck by the rush of water (+10 damage), caught up in the flood, and dragged along. Every round, a victim makes a Strength + Swim stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Success means the character escapes the flood. Otherwise, the character loses one Fatigue level and takes +5 damage. Any who fall unconscious drown. This roll is repeated until the character either escapes the flood or dies.

Subtle Taste of Poison and Purity

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Taste

You can taste all of the properties of any liquid or mixture of liquids. Unlike ''Touch of the Pearls'', you can use this sense on any number of liquids during the duration of the spell, but you must taste the liquids in question.

(Base 4, +1 Concentration)

Touch of the Pearls

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Tells you whether a liquid you hold or touch is poisonous, just as a pearl sometimes does. Safer than Subtle Taste of Poison and Purity, as you don't have to taste the possibly poisonous liquid.

In Verdan of Ex Miscellanea's version of the spell, poisonous liquids turn a faint green. According to his sigil, all his spells involve the color green.

Call of the Rushing Waters R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Allows you to find any natural body of water for which you have an Arcane Connection (for example, a vial of water from it). Once you cast the spell, you can hear the water while you concentrate. Following the sound eventually brings you to the water, but you must make simple Perception rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 to follow the sound accurately (roll once per day for long journeys). If you break concentration, you must cast the spell again. A body of water that does not move or that makes little noise requires a roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to be traced.

VOICE OF THE LAKE

You can hold a conversation with a body of water. A body of water usually knows about things directly in contact with it, such as boats and fish. Genuine lakes are too complex for this spell to affect, they are not Individuals of Aquam.

ENCHANTMENT OF THE SCRVING POOL

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Imaginem

Turns a body of water into a scrying pool. Innately magical people (including most companions with mystical powers) who look into the pool can see any spot they know of that is within sight of some natural body of water. The view you get is the same view that someone would have from a low boat on the water either close to shore or far from shore, as desired. Maximum range for scrying is 500 miles; the range of the spell is the range to the pool when the spell is cast. This ritual is not entirely of Hermetic magic, and does not conform to the normal InAq guidelines. It is an old Mercurian ritual that has become known throughout the Order, and which appears to use one body of water as an Arcane Connection to any other body of water. A number of theoreticians would like to make that work more generally, but so far this has not proved possible.

INCANTATION OF PUTRID WINE

Makes all liquids within the target room vile, and malodorous. The room where this spell is cast may not lose the stench for weeks or months. Note that this spell only affects liquids that are in the room when it is cast, and they remain malodorous even if removed from the room.

== Muto Aquam Guidelines ==

You cannot transform liquids within someone's body unless the spell is designed that way (and has a Corpus or Animal requisite).

Muto Aquam botches might change liquids inside the caster, change the wrong liquid outside him, or change the liquid in the wrong way.

Poisons created at the guideline level have an Ease Factor of 3. For every magnitude added to the spell, add three to the Ease Factor.

'''General:''' • Change a liquid into a liquid that does +(Level) points of damage on contact.

* Convert part of a water elemental's body into another type of water (salt water to fresh water, etc.), reducing the elemental's Might pool by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes. If the elemental is not destroyed by this effect, when the duration ends it can restore this Might by re-absorbing the matter.
* Level 2: Change a natural liquid into another natural liquid.
** Change a liquid into a poison causing a Light Wound.
* Level 3: Change a liquid into a poison causing a Medium Wound.
** Change a natural liquid into a slightly unnatural liquid (for example, make blue water or strawberry flavored castor oil), or vice versa.

Level 4: • Change a liquid into an unrelated solid or gas (with requisites, Terram for solids and Auram for gases).

* Change a natural liquid into two or more different natural liquids, with the two types separate (although they will mix again normally).
* Change a liquid into a poison causing a Heavy Wound.
* Change a liquid into a very unnatural liquid (for example, a shocking pink liquid that causes bizarre hallucinations) — requisites will often be required.

Level 5: • Change a liquid into a mixture of any liquid, solid (with Terram requisite), or gas (with Auram requisite).

* Change a liquid into a slightly unnatural solid or gas.
* Change a liquid into a poison causing an Incapacitating Wound.

Level 10: • Change a liquid into a very unnatural solid or gas.

• Change a liquid into a poison causing a Fatal Wound.

<span id="perdo-aquam-guidelines"></span>
== Perdo Aquam Guidelines ==

As magnitudes in these spells rise, the destruction caused becomes more subtle, or more pervasive. Sigils commonly seen in Perdo Aquam spells usually involve destruction in some specific way. Destroying water that is part of something, such as the fluid in a human being, requires a target of Part. Destroying water that is merely on someone, such as the water making a person wet, only needs a target of Individual.

Perdo Aquam botches might destroy all water in the caster, as ''Curse of the Desert'', or create water instead of destroying it.

General: • Destroy sufficient matter to reduce a water elemental's Might Score by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes.

Level 4: • Completely dry something (up to the size of a small house) that is wet.

Level 5: • Greatly reduce the amount of a liquid without destroying it completely.

Level 10: • Destroy a liquid (requisites may be required).

Level 15: • Destroy one property of a liquid (like alcohol's ability to intoxicate or sea water's saltiness).

LUNGS OF THE FISH

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part

Req: Auram

Turns water into air as it enters your lungs, allowing you to breathe water as you do air. This spell puzzles Hermetic theoreticians, as it behaves like a dynamic container target despite not being a container target.

All known attempts to create analogous effects have failed, even though analysis of this spell has not revealed any sign of non-Hermetic influence, or integrated experimentation. Most magi just point to it as an example of how Hermetic magic is not fully understood, and get on with their lives.

Removes most of the water from any object, including plants (with a Herbam requisite), possibly making the object brittle and fragile.

Breaks all waves and torrents of water (including magical ones) just before they touch you. The water either crashes to the ground or flows around you in a truly impressive display.

In Ferramentum of Verditius's version of this spell, the water breaks precisely one inch from the target, leaving a very clean line showing where the waves stopped. All of his spells may be recognized by their orderliness.

Push of the Gentle Wave

A low wave is formed to propel a small boat slowly through the water. When casting this spell, you commonly make a pushing gesture. This spell, and other similar ones, pick out a particular current in the body of water and make it behave as desired, and thus have Individual Targets.

In Cralian of Tremere's version of this spell, the frost is so crystal clear that it can hardly be seen. All of his spells are very subtle.

Turns part of the water in a circle 10 paces across into large, jagged chunks of ice and drives them to pound against anything on the water's surface. The ice can punch holes in small boats but does not damage ships. Any swimmers in the area take +15 damage, and suffer -6 and two extra botch checks on Swim rolls.

Add one magnitude if the controlled movement is slightly unnatural, two if it is very unnatural.

General: • Ward against beings associated with Aquam from one supernatural realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)

<span id="oreo-auram-guidelines"></span>
==== Oreo Auram Guidelines ====

Weather phenomena are normally created at Sight range. This is because most weather phenomena (clouds, rain, storms, and so on) naturally begin in the upper air, and so spells to create weather must have enough Range to reach this area. It is possible to create weather phenomena that start at ground level, but they are often very unnatural, and the increase in level for that precisely offsets the decrease from reducing Range to Touch. A flying wizard could, of course, use Touch range to create natural weather phenomena, but such spells are not very popular in the Order.

Sigils in Creo Auram spells commonly give the air specific properties, such as special scents or colors.

Creo Auram botches may create the wrong sort of weather, or create it targeted at the caster or some other ally.

* Level 1: Create a minor weather phenomenon: a breeze, a mist, a light drizzle.
* Level 2: Create a normal weather phenomenon: a cloud, wind, fog, rain from a cloud that already exists.
* Level 3: Create a severe weather phenomenon: deafening thunder, monsoon rain, impenetrable fog, gale force wind.
** Create a debilitating kind of air: noxious stench, mild poison, etc.
* Level 5: Create a very severe weather phenomenon: hurricane force winds, lightning strike, tornado.
* Level 25: Create an air elemental from a base amount of elemental material. (Ritual)
** Create a phenomenon in a slightly unnatural fashion: +1 magnitude (for example, indoors)
** Create a phenomenon in a very unnatural fashion: +2 magnitudes
** Create a phenomenon wholly divorced from its normal context (for example, a lightning bolt springing from the caster's hands): +4 magnitudes

Pull of the Watery Grave

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

Creates a strong undertow that pulls any object smaller than a rowboat 25 fathoms (150 feet) into the depths. Each of those caught in the undercurrent must make a Strength + Swim stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to avoid being dragged down. A roll is made each round that the spell is maintained.

TOWER OF WHIRLING WATER

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group

From a large body of water you form a waterspout that moves under your mental direction. It causes a simple die + 15 damage to anyone it hits (no Attack roll necessary). In addition, those struck must make a Quickness stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to avoid being sucked up by the waterspout. Those who fail are helplessly pulled into the spout and begin to drown immediately. When the waterspout fails, they fall up to 20 feet to the water's surface. If you direct the waterspout to move across land, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 each round to maintain it

The wave, which is only 20 feet high but up to a mile wide, is capable of capsizing ships at sea, smashing and drowning people near shore, and seriously damaging coastline communities. The tidal wave needs 5 miles of water surface to build itself up to proper proportions. The magus cannot control the wave without casting another spell.

<span id="auram-spells"></span>
== Auram Spells ==

Auram spells are powerful because the element of air is ubiquitous. Their weakness is that air is not usually violent, like fire, nor strong, like earth. Auram, however, includes in its scope most weather phenomena such as storms, lightning, rain, mist, and falling snow. Auram spells usually affect air as phenomena (winds, odors) rather than as gases.

Some target categories for Auram require some clarification. If the normal descriptions apply, they can, of course, be used.

''Individual:'' A single phenomenon: one cloud, one wind, one bolt of lightning.

Group: Several related phenomena, such as the clouds, wind, and rain in a storm.

A base Individual for Auram is a weather phenomenon that affects the area within a standard Boundary — an area one hundred paces across.

Air's GHOSTLY FORM

R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind

A thick fog forms around the magus, extending outwards for several paces. A breeze can push the fog around. The fog dissipates at its natural rate, and may be too thin to restrict sight within a minute.

(Base 2, +1 Touch, +1 Diam, +1 unnatural (the spell can be cast indoors))

CHAMBER OF SPRING BREEZES

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Creates a breeze of fresh air that continually moves throughout a room, keeping the air continuously breathable even if the room is airtight. Rose of Jerbiton's version of this spell always causes the air to smell of roses. The breeze can be created outdoors, but there it has little effect.

(Base 1, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 unnatural)

<span id="level-10-4"></span>
==== LEVEL 10 ====

JUPITER'S RESOUNDING BLOW

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Creates a thunderclap; anyone directly underneath must make a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or be deafened. If deafened, the target gets another Stamina simple roll each minute against the same Ease Factor and recovers on a success. If the first roll botches, the victim is rendered deaf for a month.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 unnatural (the spell functions indoors))

<span id="stench-of-the-twenty-corpses"></span>
==== STENCH OF THE TWENTY CORPSES ====

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind

Creates a horrible stench of rotting corpses. All those within fifty paces of the target point must make Stamina stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 or act with a –3 penalty on all rolls. Anyone who botches the roll vomits and is incapacitated for (10 – Stamina) rounds.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Diam)

<span id="wreaths-of-foul-smoke"></span>
==== WREATHS OF FOUL SMOKE ====

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind

Thick, yellow, sulfurous smoke rises up from the spot you designate, spreading and thinning naturally, but thick enough to block sight in a radius of about five paces around the point of origin. For each round anyone breathes the smoke, a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 3 must be made or a Fatigue level is lost. Once a character is Unconscious, further failed rolls result in the character taking a Light Wound each time. The area where the spell is cast will be damaged: small plants wilt and die, and tree growth is stunted. A faint stench of sulfur clings for days to anything exposed to the smoke.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Diam)

<span id="level-15-7"></span>
==== LEVEL 15 ====

BROOM OF THE WINDS

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Whips up violent, swirling winds around the target. The target must make a Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to remain standing. If the target is braced or holding onto some support, he may also make a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9.

If both rolls fail, the target is knocked in a random direction. The target may be damaged, depending on whether he strikes anything.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 unnatural)

<span id="charge-of-the-angry-winds"></span>
==== CHARGE OF THE ANGRY WINDS ====

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

A wall of wind roars away from you, starting up to 10 paces away and continuing until it dissipates naturally. The wind is confined by any existing barriers, but if unconfined it can be up to a hundred paces wide. All within the area must make a Dexterity + Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or fall down and be blown along by the winds. The rolls must be made at the start of the gale and each subsequent round that the wind is maintained. You must concentrate on the gale. Missile fire into or out of the gale is futile, and marching against the gale requires a Strength + Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 15. Failure in this attempt mandates another Dexterity + Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to keep from falling.

<span id="level-20-5"></span>
==== LEVEL 20 ====

CIRCLING WINDS OF PROTECTION

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

Req: Rego

Surrounds you with winds that circle at great speed. Since the wind picks up dust and other small, loose objects, you may be obscured. Anyone standing near enough to attack you with a hand weapon must make a Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 at the beginning of each round or be blown back. Melee Attack rolls against you are at –3, and missile or thrown attacks are at –9.

<span id="level-25-6"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

CLOUDS OF RAIN AND THUNDER

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Group

Creates a small but severe rainstorm, including lightning and winds. The storm gathers and breaks in a few seconds as the caster

concentrates, and dissipates with similar speed when he stops doing so.

Note that reducing the Range for this spell makes the storm increasingly unnatural, so versions of this spell with lower Range still have the same level.

(Base 3, +3 Sight, +1 Conc, +2 Group)

<span id="clouds-of-summer-snow"></span>
==== CLOUDS OF SUMMER SNOW ====

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Group

Creates clouds that drop snow over an area about half a mile across. The clouds gather over a few seconds at the beginning of the spell, and dissipate over the same sort of time when the caster stops concentrating. The spell does not affect temperature.

(Base 2, +3 Sight, +1 Conc, +2 Group, +1 Size)

<span id="level-30-4"></span>
==== LEVEL 30 ====

Pull of the Skybound Winds

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Makes winds rise upward, pulling one object, creature, or person up to 50 feet into the sky before letting that target drop. Even a small building can be torn from its foundation, though such a building can be no larger than 20 feet to a side, and cannot be built out of a material heavier than stout wood. Uprooted objects fall randomly, unless you make a Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to choose where the objects will fall.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 unnatural)

WINGS OF THE SOARING WIND

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Reg: Rego

Generates a massive gust of air around you that supports and pushes you along through the air at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. Hovering in place is difficult, and requires a Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 9 per round. It is dangerous for extended travel, because if you lose concentration, you are likely to sustain serious injuries (+15 damage, on average, although it may be more if the magus was very high up).

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +2, highly unnatural, +1 Rego requisite)

<span id="intellego-auram-guidelines"></span>

Intellego Auram botches normally reveal false information.

Level 1: • Make your senses unhindered by the air (for example, you can hear over a howling wind).

to breathe).

Level 4: • Learn all mundane properties of the air.

Have an intuition about some fact regarding the air.

Level 15: • Speak with air.

LEVEL 35

THE INCANTATION OF LIGHTNING

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

A lightning bolt shoots forth from your outstretched hand in the direction you are pointing, doing +30 damage to a single target it hits.

There must be nothing between you and the target. Those near the target must make Size stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 to remain standing.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +4 unnatural)

LEVEL 40

BREATH OF THE OPEN SKY

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind, Ritual

You can call up a wind capable of devastating the countryside. You must stand under the open sky to cast this spell. While you cast the spell, a breeze picks up, blowing from you in the direction you are facing. When the ritual is completed, the wind strengthens to a gale roaring over the visible countryside and beyond, strong enough to topple wooden structures and knock down trees. The wind does not weaken while it is within your sight, but loses its force naturally where you cannot see it. If you turn away from your original facing for more than a few seconds, you have to make a Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to maintain the spell. If you turn away for a minute or more, the spell ends. The air behind you is still.

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +4 size, +1 unnatural, ritual because of spectacular effect)

LEVEL 65

WRATH OF WHIRLING WINDS AND WATER

R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Group, Ritual

This spell creates an immense storm. 40 or more miles wide, of hurricane intensity. The storm builds up while you cast the ritual, and dissipates in a few seconds when the spell's duration ends. The gale-force winds and lashing waves cause immense damage along shorelines, and the winds, rain, and lightning cause extensive damage inland as well. Visibility is reduced to a few paces, missile fire is futile, and travel is nearly suicidal. Weak structures are blown over, and all but the most seaworthy ships are certain to founder unless they can be beached before the storm reaches full intensity.

The storm is not under the caster's control, and moves normally.

LEVEL 15

SAILOR'S FORETASTE OF THE MORROW

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group

You know precisely what tomorrow's weather will be, and you gain a general impression about the weather for the week ahead. This intuition only applies to the place where you cast the spell, and is based on extrapolating current conditions, so it is occasionally wrong (precise, but inaccurate). Still, it would take something like an interfering magical being, or a volcanic eruption, to throw the prediction off.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Group)

TRUE SIGHT OF THE AIR

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Vision

Lets you see clearly through all manner of obfuscation in the air nearby, including smoke, fog, and dust, even if the obfuscation is magical.

(Base 1, +2 Sun, +4 Vision)

WHISPERING WINDS

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Ind

The winds bear their tidings to your ears, allowing you to hear words spoken by any group of people within your line of sight, provided no solid barrier (including glass) intervenes. This spell is an adaptation of an effect known to Bjornaer the Founder, and fits poorly into the normal framework of Hermetic magic.

(Unique spell)

LEVEL 25

EYES OF THE BAT

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Hearing

You can move about confidently in complete darkness by sensing air and its boundaries (for example, where solid objects are). You 'hear' the boundaries of the air, so it does not permit fine discriminations. On the other hand, you can 'hear' boundaries behind you.

(Base 4, +2 Sun, +3 Hearing)

== Muto Auram Spells ==

LEVEL 20

RAIN OF STONES

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind

Reg: Terram

Turns rain into stones as it falls, causing +0 damage every two rounds (they're small stones), and maybe less if the rain is very light. People under cover are not affected. The stones revert to water when the spell expires. If it stops raining before the spell ends, no more rain is transformed, even if a different rain storm starts.

(Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)

TALONS OF THE WINDS

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind

Req: Rego

Transforms a wind into an abrasive medium that tears and claws at everything in its path. Soft materials like leaves and cloth are shredded, and people take +4 damage from innumerable bloody cuts and abrasions. This spell cannot be cast if there is not a breeze of some sort blowing, thus making it difficult to use effectively indoors. The caster is not affected by the spell, even if the wind is blowing directly at him.

In Ossium of Bjornaer's version of this spell a strange keening can be heard in the air as it cuts through targets. Ossium's wizard's sigil manifests by making many of his spells eerie or frightening.

(Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +1 Rego requisite (additional effect: protect the caster))

<span id="level-40-1"></span>
==== LEVEL 40 ====

INFERNAL SMOKE OF DEATH

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Turns normal smoke from a fire into a thick, corrosive cloud. Anyone immersed in the cloud of smoke takes +25 corrosion damage, against which armor provides only half its normal Protection value. Soft materials like cloth, fur, paper, and leather are charred and ruined by exposure to the noxious vapor. While you

concentrate, any new smoke becomes corrosive. The smoke is heavier than air, so rolls along the ground, pooling in low spots. The damage represents normal exposure to the vapor, and may be modified if characters spend unusually short or long times within it.

(Base 25, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)

<span id="level-45-1"></span>
==== LEVEL 45 ====

FOG OF CONFUSION

R: Touch, D: Year,

T: Ind, Ritual

Reg: Imaginem, Rego

Turns a bank of fog up to six miles across into a silvery mist too thick to see through. Random screams, thumps, hisses, and other noises harass and confuse anyone within the fog, perhaps even leading them into danger. People have extreme difficulty navigating through the fog, especially through unknown territory. No more than seven people, who must be present at the ritual, can see normally through the fog. The fog does not dissipate until the spell expires.

(Base 2, +1 Touch, +4 Year, +4 Size, +1 Imaginem requisite, +1 Rego requisite)

=== Muto Auram Guidelines ===

Transforming only one property of air generally lowers the level by one magnitude.

Muto Auram botches could change the caster temporarily into air, or change the air in an undesirable way.

* General: Transform air into a gas doing +level damage.
** Convert part of an air elemental's body into another type of air (wind to smoke, etc.), reducing the elemental's Might pool by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes. If the elemental is not destroyed by this effect, when the duration ends it can restore this Might by re-absorbing the matter.
* Level 3: • Transform an amount of air into another form of air.
* Level 4: • Transform an amount of air into another element (fire, earth, or water).
** Transform a gas into a harmful gas causing a Light Wound (Stamina roll against Ease Factor 6 to resist)
* Level 5: • Transform an amount of air into a mixture of elements.
** Transform an amount of air into something slightly unnatural.
** Transform a gas into a harmful gas causing a Medium Wound (Stamina roll against Ease Factor 6 to resist)

Level 3: • Make air stuffy and poor for breathing.

Level 4: • Destroy still air.

• Destroy a minor weather phenomenon: a breeze, a mist, a light drizzle.

• Reduce the intensity of a weather phenomenon by one step (for example, from very severe to severe, or from normal to minor.)

Level 5: • Destroy a normal weather phenomenon: a cloud, wind, fog, rain from a cloud that already exists.

Level 10: • Destroy a severe weather phenomenon: deafening thunder, monsoon rain, impenetrable fog, gale force wind.

RAIN OF OIL

R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind, Ritual

Req: Aquam

Turns rain into droplets of oil. Within the spell's duration, the rain of oil continues as long as the storm does, drenching the landscape with flammable liquid. The oil will evaporate at a natural rate after the rain ceases. A Creo Ignem spell can ignite the storm so that the oil burns as it falls, but this requires a Group target large enough to catch all the raindrops. Lighting the oil after it has landed is much easier.

ROOM OF STALE AIR

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Room

Makes the air in a room stuffy and uncomfortable. Any creatures that breathe air suffer a –3 penalty on all rolls involving physical exertion. In addition, for each round of exertion a character must make a simple Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6 or lose a Fatigue level. This may cause panic in some creatures or people. The speed at which the air refreshes itself depends on how well ventilated the room is.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +2 Room)

LEVEL 20

QUIET THE RAGING WINDS

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group

Stops all wind from blowing, leaving only calm air. This spell is not powerful enough to affect winds caused by Ritual magic, and only affects winds blowing on the caster when it is cast. Under normal circumstances, the winds will not pick up again for at least an hour or so.

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group)

LEVEL 45

THE CLOUDLESS SKY RETURNED

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Group

This spell clears the sky within your vision of any clouds or other meteorological activity short of a hurricane or tornado, either naturally occurring or caused by magic. The clouds take a few seconds to clear, during which time you must concentrate on them. This spell only affects meteorological activity in progress at the moment of casting, and is not powerful enough to dispel a weather condition caused by Ritual magic.

In Ferramentum's version of this spell, the clouds clear from the sky in an orderly manner, as if they were soldiers marching on parade.

CLOUDS OF THUNDEROUS MIGHT

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Group

Gathers pre-existing clouds and winds into a small storm. The storm gathers at a normal speed, but is under the caster's control as long as he can see it. The caster may use the control granted by

this spell to dissipate small storms as well. If the caster does not dissipate the storm before stopping concentrating, the storm continues as normal.

Rego Auram allows the maga to control existing weather phenomena. It is not possible to create a breeze with Rego Auram, but it is possible to direct the course of a storm. This includes starting and stopping the rain at the maga's command.

Controlling an amount of air with great strength or great precision raises the magnitude of the spell by one level.

General: • Ward against beings associated with Auram from one supernatural realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)

== ''Creo Corpus Guidelines'' ==

Many Creo Corpus spells are most useful as Ritual spells. Unless otherwise noted, a healing spell cast other than as a Momentary Duration Ritual actually suspends the healing process so that, upon the spell's expiration, wounds are as fresh as they were when the spell was cast. No Hermetic spell can restore Fatigue levels.

A spell that can heal something can also heal less serious versions of the same thing. Thus, a spell that can heal Medium Wounds can also heal Light Wounds. However, a spell to heal wounds cannot cure diseases,

no matter how high its level, and vice versa. Spells that give a bonus to Recovery rolls work no matter what the character is recovering from.

The physical characteristics are Strength, Stamina, Dexterity, and Quickness, and they can be affected and improved by Corpus magic.

Creo Corpus botches often inflict damage instead of healing it.

Creo Animal spells may be used as guidelines and examples for Creo Corpus spells.

'''Level 30:''' • Heal an Incapacitating Wound

• Increase one of a person's physical Characteristics by one point, to no more than 0.

• Cause a person to reach full physical maturity over the course of a single day or night. This accelerated maturation only applies during the spell's Duration, and thus full effect requires a Sun Duration spell cast early in the day or night. People do not learn under the influence of this spell, and for these purposes full maturity is reached around the age of twenty.

THE SEVERED LIMB MADE WHOLE

R: Touch, D: Mom,

A limb that has been detached from the body can be reattached, but any decay that has occurred on the severed limb remains after the limb is reattached. After a day of decomposition, a limb is weak. After seven days, it is nearly useless and infects the character on whom it is replaced (Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 or take a Medium Wound). If it's been severed for more than two weeks, the limb is completely useless.

INCANTATION OF THE BODY MADE WHOLE

R: Touch, D: Mom,

T: Ind, Ritual

Heals all damage to a human body at the conclusion of the ritual. The spell can only heal wounds, not such damage as missing limbs, or diseases and damage from poisons.

(Base 35, +1 Touch)

LEVEL 75

THE SHADOW OF LIFE RENEWED

R: Touch, D: Mom,

T: Ind, Ritual

Req: Mentem

Brings the semblance of life to a corpse. During the ritual, healing spells work on the corpse, which is important because the body must be physically whole or else it simply dies again once it is brought back to life. For each day that the person has been dead, roll for aging. When the ritual is complete, roll a simple die to determine the success of the attempt:

* 1: Body dissolves
* 2: Body possessed by a demon, faerie, or other supernatural entity
* 3: Mindless, useless living corpse
* 4 5: Automaton with no Abilities
* 6 7: Automaton, but Abilities as a normal person's
* 8: Person with self direction but no personality, and somehow dangerously demented
* 9 10: Person with will, but no personality. In any case, the revived person is not truly alive and is unable to gain experience points. Also, the person must make an aging roll at the beginning of each year of its existence, regardless of age. This is the closest that the Order has gotten to raising a person from the dead.

SIGHT OF THE TRUE FORM

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Vision

You see the true, original form of any person whose form has been changed or masked. This spell can see through mundane masks and disguises at level 10, and can see through the effects of other spells that are equal to or lower than the level of this spell.

PHYSICIAN'S EYE

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Determines the general health of a single person. Specific afflictions appear to you as areas of yellow coloration on the person's body. A Perception + Medicine stress roll is required to identify unusual diseases. The Ease Factor is determined by the rarity of the disease.

WHISPERS THROUGH THE BLACK GATE R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

Req: Mentem

You can speak through the barrier — the figurative &quot;gate&quot; — that stands between the dead and the living, to one corpse that has not yet decayed into a skeleton. The corpse cannot have been buried in Church burial, nor have belonged to a spirit that went straight to Heaven (for example, a saint or a crusader). The spirit that you speak with is not compelled to tell the truth; you can, of course, find ways to coerce or trick it into doing so. All those around you can hear the voice of the corpse.

THE INEXORABLE SEARCH

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Determines the location of a specific person. To cast the spell you need a map and an Arcane Connection. After casting the spell, you can move your finger over the map at the rate of one hour per square foot of map. When your finger passes over the person's location as represented on the map, you sense the person's presence. (If the person is not in the area covered by the map, no sensations result.) You can locate the person to within a thumb's width on the map. A similar spell allows you to search for a dead body (Tracing the Trail of Death's Stench).

GIFT OF THE BEAR'S FORTITUDE

Your flesh becomes resistant to physical damage. You get +3 to your Soak. Your flesh is tough and insensitive; any rolls that involve a sensitive touch (such as for picking a lock) are at -1.

(Base 15, +2 Sun)

SHAPE OF THE WOODLAND PROWLER

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Animal

You place a wolf skin over yourself or another, and the target changes into a wolf. The target may change back at will, ending the spell. Before casting this spell, you must first, of course, acquire the skin of a wolf, if you want to be able to end the spell early.

CLOAK OF BLACK FEATHERS

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Animal

You hang a small cape of raven feathers on your back and transform into a raven. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell.

(Base 20. +2 Sun)

<span id="muto-corpus-guidelines"></span>
=== Muto Corpus Guidelines ===

These spells transform people. There are beneficial spells to cast on yourself and your companions, and harmful spells to cast on your foes.

Transformations do not usually completely eradicate the original form, something of the original remains. If you turn a fat, one-armed man into a wolf, the wolf is fat, three-legged, and male.

Transformations can have subtle (or sometimes dramatic) permanent effects. Someone who spends a month or more as an animal begins to act and think like that animal. Eventually, weak-willed individuals might lose their human identity altogether. When transformed back into a human, the target might temporarily or permanently retain some feature of the other shape. Someone turned into a rabbit and back might keep a fondness for carrots or retain unnaturally big ears. Transformations are tricky things.

Muto Corpus spells cannot alter a person's mind, so they leave the transformed person's intelligence and knowledge intact. Magi can cast spells while in animal form, but they suffer the normal –15 penalty for casting without hands or voice. The transformed person gains any abilities the animal form has though it may take a day or so of experience to get used to using them.

To change accouterments along with the body involves requisites. For example, you need a casting requisite of Animal for leather worn, Aquam for any liquids carried, and Terram for metal objects worn (including studs in armor). Accouterments are transformed only if they are actually being worn, not if they are just being carried in the hand. Simply put, equipment will not be transformed for one of two reasons: either because you choose not to use the casting requisites or because the storyguide rules that the equipment is not sufficiently part of the target's worn equipment. This untransformed equipment falls to the ground.

Certain shapechanging spells allow the target to change back by concentrating. While concentrating, you symbolically remove some item to break the spell, such as a wolfskin cloak or some water in your hands. These foci are essential if you are to be able to break the spell in this way. If you cast the spell without them, you must either dispel the magic with Perdo Vim, or wait for the duration to expire.

Muto Corpus botches may lead to a spell lasting indefinitely, and proving hard to dispel.

* Level 2: Change someone to give them a minor ability.
* Level 3: Utterly change the appearance or size of a person (though they must still remain human in form).
** Change non-living human bone to have an unnatural property (requisites may be needed).
* Level 5: Make a body resistant to damage (+1 Soak).
** Add or remove human body parts from the target in such a way that he no longer looks human. These parts are normally functional, although a spell may be deliberately designed so that they are not. The Target is Part, not Individual (although Group and higher Targets work as normal)
* Level 10: Turn a human into a land animal (with an Animal requisite).
** Make a body resistant to damage (+2 Soak).
* Level 15: Make a body resistant to damage (+3 Soak).
* Level 20: Turn a human into a bird or a fish (Animal requisite)

LEVEL 35

STANCE OF THE PATIENT TREE R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

Reg: Herbam

You turn yourself into a tree about 12 feet high, with a trunk about a foot thick. You can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a tree. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While in tree form, you do not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The tree branch you use to let yourself change back determines the kind of tree you become, and you cannot cast the spell without the branch.

<span id="level-40-3"></span>
==== LEVEL 40 ====

CLOAK OF MIST R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Auram

You turn yourself into a thick, cohesive mist of approximately human size. You can float through the air at walking speed and can see and hear what is going on around you. You can also seep through cracks, but cannot move through solid objects. You may return to human form at any time, but doing so ends the spell. As mist, you are subject to the forces of the wind. In order to cast this spell, you inhale some mist, and you keep the mist in your 'mouth' until you want to end the spell.

(Base 30, +2 Sun)

Transform to Water

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Aquam

You turn yourself into water, one pint for every pound of the your weight. As water, you can hold yourself together unless someone makes an effort to separate part of you from the rest. You can roll slowly across the ground, but

cannot move uphill. You can hear sounds, feel things that touch you, and can sense temperature. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. You cannot resume human form if a significant part of your body/water is separated from the rest. You pour a small amount of water into your hands when you cast the spell.

THE SILENT VIGIL

R: Per, D: Moon, T: Ind

Reg: Terram

You can move into and become part of a rock formation that is at least twice your size. While in the stone, you can hear what is going on around you, but you cannot use other senses. The spell lasts until you come out, and you must come out where you went in. You have no need for food or drink, though you do age. Rolls to recover from Fatigue or wounds take twice as long to make while you are in the stone. Casting requisites are required for items you take with you into the stone.

==== LEVEL 60 ====

MISTS OF CHANGE

R: Voice, D: Sun &amp; Year,

T: Bound, Ritual

Req: Animal

As this spell is cast, a whipping wind arises and patches of mist begin to roll across the landscape. Sometimes, a patch of mist suddenly envelops a person for a few seconds, during which time the victim cannot move. When the mist blows away, continuing its course, the person is left transformed into a random creature. Roll a simple die to determine the result:

* 1: Wolf
* 2: Horse
* 3: Brown Bear
* 4: Large Toad
* 5: Ferret
* 6: Viper
* 7: Boar/Sow
* 8: Dog
* 9: Cat
* 0: Other (storyguide picks; be cruel).

People transformed retain their human minds, but inherit all the passions and instincts of their new forms.

The mist covers the target area, which must be in sight when you cast the spell. The mists affect the area until sunrise or sunset, and transform anyone who remains in the area during that time. For important characters, roll a simple die when the spell is cast and every half hour afterwards, and on a roll lower than the number of rolls made so far the mists envelope and transform them at some point in the next half hour. The transformations last for a Year.

Touch of the Goose Feather

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

The target lets out a loud sneeze. Spellcasters who sneeze must make Intelligence + Concentration stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 12 to maintain concentration, and others get –1 on most activities at the moment of the sneeze.

Turns a dead body or mindless undead body to dust in two rounds. The spell doesn't affect those undead possessed by spirits. To do this to an animal corpse requires a Perdo Animal spell.

(Base 5, +2 Voice)

THE WOUND THAT WEEDS

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

When casting this spell, you point at the victim and a large wound opens on his or her body. The wound is not a deep one, but it bleeds profusely. This is only a Light Wound, but it looks bad.

(Base 15, +2 Voice)

CURSE OF THE LEPROUS FLESH

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

This spell inflicts leprosy on the target, which causes a person's flesh to rot off in a matter of weeks - a truly hideous sight. Much of the target's flesh literally hangs from his or her frame, and there is a pungent rotting smell about him at all times. The target takes an Incapacitating Wound from the disease, and must roll as normal to recover. The target also loses a point of Stamina by the time the disease ends. If the victim somehow survives this curse, he is shunned by mundane communities. If the victim succeeds in a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6 when the spell is cast, he shakes off the disease, although he still feels unwell for a few days, and may have problems if an astute doctor realizes he is leprous.

(Base 20, +1 Touch)

GRIP OF THE CHOKING HAND

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

The target feels an invisible, strangling hand on the throat. Each round, the target loses a Fatigue level. Once the target falls unconscious, the spell has no further effect. The spell works by seriously constricting the target's windpipe, hence the feeling. This constriction is not quite enough to kill, however.

INCANTATION OF THE MILKY EYES

TWIST OF THE TONGUE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Twists the target's tongue into a spiral, completely destroying the ability to speak. A grave offense to a magus. The damage heals as a Medium Wound.

CLENCHING GRASP OF THE CRUSHED HEART

<span id="level-45-3"></span>
==== LEVEL 45 ====

THE KISS OF DEATH

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The person you kiss dies a sudden death. The only mark on the corpse is the black imprint of your lips. You do not need to speak when casting this spell, and thus gain no penalty from silence. (This is why the spell is higher level than the guidelines would indicate.)

(Base 30, +1 Touch, +2 for no words)

General: • Ward against creatures associated with Corpus from one realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with a Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. Note that Hermetic magi have no Might, and thus are not affected by such spells. (Touch, Ring, Circle)

Curse of the

UNPORTENDED PLAGUE

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual

Starts a plague in a city or other Boundary. Everyone within the boundary is afflicted with the disease when the ritual is complete, and suffers as described under Curse of the Leprous Flesh, on the previous page. The conditions causing the disease last but a moment, so people entering the area after the spell is cast are safe. Using, or even transcribing, this spell is rigorously discouraged by most of the Order of Hermes. (Note: the disease caused by this spell is not the later Bubonic Plague, which is unknown in Europe in 1220.)

DESPAIR OF THE

(Base 4, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)

ENDURANCE OF THE BERSERKERS

R: Per. D: Conc. T: Ind

Your body acts as though it were unwounded and unfatigued for as long as you concentrate. Keep track of the actual Fatigue levels that the body loses while &quot;berserk,&quot; because as soon as the spell wears off, you lose those levels. If you run out of Fatigue levels, the spell terminates immediately and you fall unconscious.

A character under the influence of this spell does risk worsening wounds, but he may not notice.

(Base 10, +1 Conc)

GIFT OF THE FROG'S LEGS

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Allows the target to leap up to 15 feet vertically or 25 feet horizontally (2 feet less for every Encumbrance point). The person must make a Dexterity - Encumbrance stress roll against an Ease Factor of 0 to land without injury. A miss indicates that he takes a Light Wound, and a botch indicates a Medium Wound. The target can only leap once for each casting of the spell, and that leap must be made within ten seconds. As with a frog's leap, a running start does not improve the leap.

(Base 10, +1 Touch.)

LIFTING THE DANGLING PUPPET

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Lifts a person of Size +1 or less vertically into the air. Generally, you can make the target rise or descend as fast as smoke rises, but a heavier person rises more slowly and falls more quickly.

THE GIFT OF VIGOR

Transfers bodily energy from you to any target who is at a lower Fatigue level than you. You are thus at the target's current Fatigue level, and he or she assumes your previous level. If you lose a Fatigue level from casting this spell, the loss comes after the transfer. Magi have long looked for a way to restore their energy in order to cast more spells.

Transports you to any place within seven leagues either that you can see or that vou have an Arcane Connection with. If

vou fail an Intelligence + Finesse stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9, your arrival goes slightly awry. For instance, you might fall when you appear, or just be facing the wrong way. A botch means you appear in the wrong place. perhaps even in a wall.

Praefactus of Bonisagus's version of this spell always allows him to appear in a safe, unembarrassing place (assuming he doesn't fail his Finesse roll). All Praefactus's spells make him seem as dignified as possible manifesting his wizard's sigil.

=== Oreo Derbam Guidelines ===

These spells create and heal plants. Any food created is nutritious only if the creation is a Ritual. The guideline levels given below are generally for conjuring the leafy parts of plants.

Plants may be created living or dead with equal ease. To create treated Herbam products (for example, cut timber, a vegetarian meal, or linen or cotton cloth) add one magnitude to the level necessary to create the equivalent amount of unworked living or dead plants. To create treated and processed Herbam products (for example, clothes or furniture), add two magnitudes.

A single spell generally only creates a single type of plant product.

Creo Herbam botches may create plants in the wrong place, or create the wrong kind of plant.

* Level 1: Ensure that a plant grows well for the duration of the spell. This guideline can affect a plant up to ten paces in each direction, a large tree. (That is, this guideline includes a +3 Size enhancement.)
** Create a plant product (like a fruit or leaf).
** Create a plant.
** Prevent a plant from becoming sick.
** Heal a Light Wound to a plant.
* Level 2: Create a processed plant product, like a finished plank of wood.
** Preserve a dead plant from decay.
** Heal a Medium Wound to a plant.
* Level 3: Create wood in an unnatural shape, such as a living wall or bridge.
** Heal a Heavy Wound to a plant.
* Level 4: Heal an Incapacitating Wound to a plant.
* Level 5: Heal all Wounds to a plant.
* Level 10: Heal all damage to a plant, including wounds, disease, and poison.
* Level 15: Bring a plant to maturity in a single day or night. The accelerated growth only happens during the duration of the spell, so full maturity requires a Sun duration spell cast soon after sunrise or sunset.
** Restore a manufactured wooden item that has been damaged to the peak of its capabilities. This spell can also restore decay, but the damage must be light.
* Level 20: Bring a plant to maturity in about two hours.
* Level 25: Bring a plant to maturity in about ten Diameters (twenty minutes).
* Level 30: Bring a plant to maturity in a single Diameter.
* Level 40: Bring a plant to maturity in a moment.

THE WALKING CORPSE

R: Touch, D: Year,

Herbam spells work on plants and plant matter, both living and dead. Since wood is a common material in weapons, vehicles, and buildings, Herbam spells can be useful in improving or destroying physical things. They can also be used to bring the plant world to your aid.

A base Individual for Herbam is a plant roughly one pace in each direction.

Causes strong, woody vines to grow rapidly from fertile earth. The vines cover a circle 2 paces across and reach 6 feet high. Anything caught within them is immobilized. To avoid the vines, the target must make a Quickness — Encumbrance stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9.

==== WALL OF THORNS ====

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

Within seconds, this spell creates a straight wall of woody, thorny bushes up to 20 paces long, 1 pace thick, and 4 paces high. The thorns, which are unnaturally resilient, have a + 15 Soak, are cut by edged weapons only, and cutting through requires inflicting a Heavy Wound. Bodily forcing one's way through the wall requires a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 and does +15 damage whether the attempt succeeds or fails. If the roll botches, an additional 5 points of damage are suffered. The wall grows out of existing bushes or fertile soil. A Dexterity + Athletics stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 allows a character to scale the wall, but the character takes +10 damage in the process.

THE BOUNTIFUL FEAST

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Special, Ritual

This ritual, which must be cast at noon on the day after the winter solstice, attempts to ensure that all crops that grow within its target will be healthy and fruitful. The spell protects against non-magical blight and other diseases. It can't control the weather or prevent others from harming crops, but it does cause crops to be healthier, larger, and tastier than they otherwise would be. The target of this spell is the fields owned by those present at the ritual. The spell must be

cast within the region affected by the spell, although that region need not be contiguous. Although food plants are affected most by this ritual, all plants are made healthier to some degree.

HUNT FOR THE WILD HERB

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Smell

When you cast this spell, you can smell one sort of plant, and follow the scent, as long as you continue to concentrate. You must have a sample of the type of plant you are looking for. A Perception stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 is needed to follow the scent. If there is no plant of the relevant type fairly close by (close enough to smell), you smell nothing, although the spell still works.

Intuition of the Forest

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Group

You engage in a type of communion with the woods that you are in, giving you an intuitive sense of how to get along in the forest, and how to get the most out of the forest without causing it harm. You get a +3 to all nature-oriented rolls (not including spells) when in a forest or similar area. Causing significant harm to the forest cancels this spell.

SHRIEK OF THE IMPENDING SHAFTS

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Hearing

Lets you know where anything wooden will be in the immediate future by a shriek that sounds in the air in advance of the wood's coming. A piece of wood that is controlled may change course, so the spell is sometimes wrong. You get a +9 bonus on Defense scores against wooden weapons (provided that you have the freedom to dodge), and you can automatically dodge wooden missiles fired from more than ten paces away.

The shriek is only audible to you, and it cannot be simulated by people making noises.

CONVERSE WITH PLANT AND TREE

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

You can speak with a plant for one conversation. The level of conversation depends on the type of plants; longer-lived and more noble plants have more to say. A single question and response takes ten to thirty minutes, with slower-growing plants speaking more slowly. Typically, plants can talk about the soil and about other plants around them, but have limited awareness of more momentary events, such as the passing of animals or people, unless that passing has a direct bearing on the plant (for example, a person cut its trunk). News can spread quickly through a forest when it has to, called from tree to tree on the wind. Bystanders cannot understand your conversation.

(Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter)

<span id="intellego-derbam-guidelines"></span>
=== Intellego Derbam Guidelines ===

As with most Intellego magic, Intellego Herbam botches generally give false information.

Level 1: • Gain an intuitive knowledge of a plant (for example, know whether a given action would harm a plant).

Level 2: • Locate a plant.

Level 3: • Learn general information, or a single specific fact about a plant or an item made from plant products.

Level 4: • Learn all mundane properties of a plant or an item made from plant products.

Level 15: • Speak with a plant.

<span id="muto-herbam-guidelines"></span>
=== Muto herbam Guidelines ===

These guidelines assume that when you change a plant, it's still a plant in some way. Changing a plant into something else usually involves a spell one level of magnitude higher than the guideline most appropriate to the action. To change plants into treated or finished material (for example, wooden furniture, a vegetarian meal, linen or cotton cloth) add one magnitude to the level necessary to change plants into natural, unworked plants.

Muto Herbam botches may turn the caster into a plant, or turn the target into an animated plant hostile to the caster.

Level 3: • Change a plant or item made from plant products.

Level 4: • Change a plant or item made from plant products into metal or stone (Terram requisite).

• Awaken the consciousness of a plant (Mentem requisite).

Level 5: • Cause a plant to bend or twist rapidly in place.

<span id="perdo-herbam-guidelines"></span>
=== Perdo Herbam Guidelines ===

These spells destroy plants and plant material. Since many items are made of wood, these spells can be quite destructive. The guidelines given are for destroying dead wood. Destroying live wood is usually a bit harder — add one magnitude.

Perdo Herbam botches normally destroy the wrong thing, possibly including some of the caster's clothing.

Level 2: • Cause the leaves to fall off a plant.

Level 3: • Spoil an amount of food.

Level 4: • Destroy an amount of dead wood.

Level 5: • Destroy a plant.

TRANSFORMATION OF THE THORNY STAFF

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Causes a length of wood (up to 6 feet in length) to grow thick, sharp thorns at whatever spots you touch. If the spell is cast on a staff, the thorns add +4 to the damage done by the staff.

(Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

PIERCING SHAFT OF WOOD

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Req: Rego

Turns a piece of wood into a sleek, barbed, strong shaft that flies through the air at a target. Damage depends on the size of the item from which the shaft is formed: staff (upper size limit) +10, 2-foot branch +8, wand +5. This spell cannot miss, but it is resisted.

STIR THE SLUMBERING TREE

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Mentem

Raises any tree into a state of consciousness resembling that of a human. Such a tree can see and hear what is going on around it, and at a normal human level of perception. Such a tree may share some mental attributes or personality traits with the caster. The tree can rearrange its branches over the course of several hours, though too slowly for people to observe the movement from second to second. Most trees in magical areas are already awake.

Curse of the Haunted Forest

R: Touch, D: Year,

T: Group, Ritual

Req: Perdo

Turns a previously normal small forest into a haunted and dangerous place. The trees become gnarled and hideous, and the imaginative can see menacing faces in them. The trees also become conscious and cruel; capable of sight, hearing, and limited movement. While they cannot uproot themselves, they can move their branches about, and can reach the ground in an hour or two. Only ill-tempered animals, such as boars and crows, live in these woods, and nothing in them is edible. The only knowledge of what might happen should this ritual be attempted in a faerie forest comes from ancient and disputed legends of the Order of Hermes.

Curse of the Rotted Wood

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Causes a non-living wooden object to rot and fall apart. Objects up to the size of a single door can be affected, but things that size take up to two rounds to decay. Usually, large chunks of wood start falling off the target, and slowly crumble to smaller and smaller pieces, until only dust is left.

Ferramentum of Verditius's version of this spell is very orderly as per his wizard's sigil. The decay of the object starts from the top and continues to the bottom, leaving only dust as it goes.

As you walk through a forest after casting this spell, all the plant material 10 paces in front of you and 5 paces to either side withers and dies. Trees are reduced to bare trunks, while their leaves and all smaller plants turn to ash. You can walk for 7 miles with each casting of this spell. Use of this spell in faerie woods is not recommended. This spell was originally invented by a magus of House Flambeau, and he was awarded a prize for it by his primus.

DANCE OF THE STAVES

Deflects a single blow of any weapon made of wood, up to the size of a twohanded club.

<span id="tangle-of-wood-and-thorns"></span>
==== TANGLE OF WOOD AND THORNS ====

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Takes a length of wood that you designate and hurls it at a target (a Targeting roll is required). The wood wraps around and immobilizes the target (assuming that there is enough wood), who must make a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to break free (one attempt per round). If the victim ever botches, he cannot escape without outside help. If the length of wood has thorns, it does +6 damage when it hits, and again each time the target tries to break free, whether successful or not. When the caster stops concentrating, the target can escape on a Strength roll against an Ease Factor of 6.

The plants grab and wrap themselves around the people nearest to them (Strength stress roll of 9+ to break free, rolled once per minute). If a roll to break free ever botches, the victim cannot escape on his or her own. With a Concentration roll of 6+, you can release one individual a round.

LORD OF THE TREES

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

THE TREACHEROUS SPEAR

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind

This spell animates a wooden or wooden-hafted melee weapon in someone else's hand, and makes that weapon attack its holder until the wielder is dead or the weapon is destroyed. When the spell is cast, the weapon tries to break its wielder's hold (Quickness - Encumbrance stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to hang on). On subsequent rounds, the wielder hangs on by making Strength stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 6, allowed once per round. If a roll to hold on ever botches, the wielder loses control of the weapon. and is hit by it automatically (see below). While still in its wielder's grip, the weapon does not strike him or her, but does not strike on the wielder's behalf either. Once the weapon breaks free or is released, it attacks its wielder, using his Attack and Damage scores.

The former wielder may fight the rebellious weapon. The weapon uses its defense rating as its Defense total. It has no Soak, and is 'killed' after it takes a wound depending on its size. One-handed weapons must take a Medium Wound, while two-handed weapons must take a Heavy Wound. The damage of thrusting and missile weapons is halved when attacking the renegade weapon.

(Base 10, +2 Voice, +1 Diam)

TWIST THE LIVING TREE

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

You make a living tree bend into unusual positions. Depending on your needs, you can make a cage, a shelter, or a wall. Even the leaves can be commanded, maybe to form

a solid roof that sheds rain. Takes one to ten minutes to complete (depending on the complexity of the new shape), during which time you must maintain concentration.

CALLING THE COUNCIL OF THE TREES

R: Touch, D: Moon,

T: Bound, Ritual

Req: Intellego

You call all magical and potentially mobile trees within the woodland where you cast the ritual to the site of the ritual. The trees are compelled to come, and will likely be interested in whoever has called them. The attitude of the trees depends on the forest and the nature of the one who called. Once gathered, the trees hold meetings, summon ancient powers, and discuss the problems facing their kind. You may speak, and understand what the trees are discussing. The results of the conference may not be entirely in your favor. The trees remain animated for a month and may seek to return home before the end of that period.

As fire is volatile and dangerous, so are these spells. Magi who pursue the Art of fire do so with fine regard for the dangers and powers involved, for fire is both dangerous and mighty, to friend and foe alike. Storyguides should make Ignem botches particularly deadly.

Light and heat also fall within the domain of this Form. It's important to remember that heat also includes relative absence of heat, so spells that result in cold temperatures are possible through Ignem.

Heats a piece of metal so that it is too hot to touch. Something the size of a breastplate or helmet does +5 damage if in direct contact with the skin for one round. For each additional round, more damage is done, the amount dropping by two points each round (+3 damage on round two, then +1). Smaller objects do less damage. Most metal armor has leather or cloth underneath that gives the victim a +3 Soak bonus against the heat.

==== LAMP WITHOUT FLAME ====

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

This spell creates a steady light as bright as daylight on a cloudy day. The light has no apparent source, but illuminates an area about ten paces across, centered on a point indicated by the caster. This point may be a mobile item.

==== LEVEL 15 ====

BLADE OF THE VIRULENT FLAME

R: Touch, D: Diameter, T: Ind

Forms a fire along the length of a metal blade. This flame doubles the weapon damage score for the blade (or adds +5, whichever is greater), and can start fires as well. If the spell is cast repeatedly on the same blade, the blade gets hot enough to melt after half an hour, which ends the spell. Letting the blade cool for half an hour between castings avoids this.

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +1 Diameter)

<span id="flash-of-the-scarlet-flames"></span>
==== FLASH OF THE SCARLET FLAMES ====

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

A brilliant red flash explodes in the air where you designate. If you target a person's face the target needs a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to avoid temporary blindness. If the target botches the roll, he is permanently blinded. If temporarily blinded, he can try to make a simple Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 each minute to recover. The flash is equivalent to looking straight at the sun.

In Rose of Jerbiton's version of this spell, there is a faint odor of roses in the area where the flash explodes.

PILUM OF FIRE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

A 2-foot, thick, spear-shaped jet of fire flies from your palms, doing +15 damage to the individual it hits.

<span id="level-25-16"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

ARC OF FIERY RIBBONS

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group

A dozen multi-hued ribbons of flame leap from your hands and fly out as far as your voice carries, covering a 60-degree arc. All those in the arc take +10 damage.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +2 Group)

COAT OF FLAME

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind

Req: Rego

The target is swathed in fire, and takes +5 damage every round while the spell is in effect. That is, the damage must be rolled against Soak twenty times during the spell. The Rego requisite ensures that the fire does not spread.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +1 Rego requisite)

<span id="level-35-3"></span>
==== LEVEL 35 ====

BALL OF ABYSMAL FLAME

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

A ball of flame shoots from your hand to strike a single target, doing +30 damage.

Marius of Tremere's version of the spell causes the ball to make a loud bang when it hits the target. His sigil is a gaudiness in his spells.

(Base 25, +2 Voice; the ball appearing to shoot from your hand is a cosmetic effect)

CIRCLE OF ENCOMPASSING FLAMES

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Creates a circle of flames 6 feet high. The circle begins at a 1-pace radius, but you can make it shrink to a pillar or grow to a 3-pace radius as you concentrate if you cast with a Rego requisite. Anyone moving through the flames takes +20 damage. You cannot move the center of the circle.

=== Creo Ignem Guidelines ===

Spells that create fires are versatile weapons — destructive to living things, undead, buildings, and morale. Those who depend on fire spells, however, risk botching. Fire is an unforgiving element for those who lose control of it, and self-incineration is always a possibility.

Typical sigils seen in Creo Ignem spells involve the flame being a specific color or shape, or giving off an unusual smell.

Level 1: • Create light equivalent to moonlight.

Level 2: • Create light equivalent to candlelight.

* Heat an object to be warm to the touch.
* Ignite something extremely flammable (like oil or a wick).

Level 3: • Create light equivalent to torchlight.

* Heat an object to be hot to the touch.
* Ignite something very flammable (like parchment).

Level 4: • Create a fire doing +5 damage.

* Create light as bright as a cloudy day.
* Ignite something flammable (like dry wood or charcoal)
* Heat an object enough to boil water.

Level 5: • Create a fire doing +10 damage.

* Create a fire doing +5 damage in an unnatural shape, such as in a ring or sheet, or covering an item. (Purely cosmetic shapes are free.)
* Create light as bright as direct sunlight on a clear day.
* Ignite something slightly flammable (like leather or damp wood).
* Heat an object enough to make it glow red-hot. This is hot enough to melt tin or lead.

Level 10: • Create a fire doing +15 damage.

* Create a fire doing +10 damage in an unnatural shape.
* Ignite something barely flammable (like a human body).
* Heat an object enough to make it glow white-hot. This is hot enough to melt almost all metals, and many rocks.

Level 15: • Create a fire doing +20 damage.

Level 20: • Create a fire doing +25 damage.

Create a fire doing +20 damage in an unnatural shape.

Level 25: • Create a fire doing +30 damage.

• Create a fire elemental from a base amount of elemental matter. (Ritual)

The intensity of a fire also affects the difficulty of changing it. For every five points by which the fire's damage exceeds +5, add one magnitude to the level of the spell.

* General: Convert part of a fire elemental's body into another type of fire (clear to sooty flame, etc.), reducing the elemental's Might pool by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes. If the elemental is not destroyed by this effect, when the duration ends it can restore this Might by re-absorbing the matter.
* Level 1: Change one characteristic of a fire within the target area (for example, make a fire burn more brightly, or produce more smoke).
* Level 2: Totally change a fire into another natural fire (changing any or all of its characteristics).
* Level 3: Change a fire so that it is slightly unnatural (for example, make the flames colored, or make the smoke smell of roses). May require requisites.
* Level 4: Change a fire so that it is completely unnatural (for example, multicolored flames that form images while the popping of the fire plays music). Often requires requisites.
* Level 5: Change a fire into a natural example of another element, with an appropriate requisite.
* Level 10: Change a fire into an unnatural example of another element, with an appropriate requisite.

SHADOWS OF THE FIRES PAST

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Vision

WORDS OF THE FLICKERING FLAME

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Allows you to converse with a fire, commonly very chaotic and distractible. Promising a fire more fuel might keep its interest. Fires are mostly aware of what they've burned, but they have a limited awareness of what goes on around them as well.

Show of the Flames and Smoke

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Causes smoke of different colors, streams of flame, and strange popping and sizzling noises to come from a fire. The effect is so spectacular that onlookers are either entranced or horrified, depending on the circumstances. The pyrotechnics might ignite nearby flammable objects and cause minor burns to those within 2 paces of the fire.

Eradicates the heat of a bonfire, which, however, continues to burn until the fuel already covered in flame is consumed. The flames do not spread, or harm anything

beyond what they were already burning. If the fire is extinguished and relit, it will burn hot again, as it is now a different fire.

(Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +3 Str)

Conjuration of the Indubitable Cold

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Cools the air within ten paces of the target, leaving it slightly below freezing. All nonliving things are chilled thoroughly, not just on the surface. All living things (except you, if you cast with a Rego requisite) lose one Fatigue level. House fires become as small as campfires, bonfires become as small as torch fires, and campfires and smaller fires go out.

The intensity of a fire also affects the difficulty of destroying it. For every five points by which the fire's damage exceeds +5, add one magnitude to the level of the spell.

Perdo Ignem botches might create fire instead of destroying it, or freeze the caster.

General:

• Destroy sufficient matter to reduce a fire elemental's Might Score by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes.

Level 2: • Greatly reduce the amount of light in an area.

Level 3: • Completely extinguish all light in an area.

• Reduce the size of a fire without destroying it completely.

Level 4: • Extinguish a fire, cooling the ashes to merely warm.

· Chill an object.

Chill a person so that they lose a Fatigue level.

Level 5: • Strongly chill an object. (For example, freeze water.)

• Chill a person so that they take +5 damage.

Level 10: • Destroy one aspect of a fire (for example, heat or light).

• Chill a person so strongly that they take +10 damage.

The intensity of a fire also affects the difficulty of controlling it. For every five points by which the fire's damage exceeds +5, add one magnitude to the level of the spell.

Rego Ignem spells can control heat or light as well as fire.

Rego Ignem botches normally result in the fire doing exactly what the caster does not want.

* General: Ward against beings associated with Ignem from one supernatural realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)
* Level 3: Control a fire in a natural fashion (for example, control its direction of spread).

Move a fire quickly through space while leaving it burning naturally.

* Transport a fire instantly up to 5 paces. Add 1 magnitude to increase the distance to 50 paces. 2 magnitudes for 500 paces, 3 magnitudes for 1 league, 4 magnitudes for seven leagues, and 5 magnitudes to a place for which you have an Arcane Connection.
* Level 4: Control a fire in a slightly unnatural fashion (for example, stop it from burning a person).
* Level 5: Control a disembodied spirit associated with Ignem.

TREMULOUS VAULT OF THE TORCH'S FLAME

R: Voice, D: Mom T: Ind

Causes a fire to guiver a few seconds and then make a leap of up to 10 feet in any direction. A Targeting roll is required to hit a specific target. The flame stays at the spot it hits if it can burn there (see rules for fire damage on page 407). Otherwise, it simply scorches the spot and goes out (doing +5 damage).

(Base 3, +2 Voice)

LEVEL 10

LEAP OF THE FIRE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Causes a bonfire to make a leap of up to 10 paces in any direction, where it catches if there is fuel, or burns out if there is none. Make a Targeting roll to hit a target; the flames do +10 damage.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 size)

LEVEL 20

LIGHT SHAFT OF THE NIGHT

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Group

Collects moonbeams and starlight into a single vertical shaft of soft, silvery light that moves under your control. It illuminates an area 15 paces across with light nearly equal to sunlight (if the moon is out) or moonlight (if the moon is not out). If the sky is overcast, the spell does not work. Can only be cast under the night sky.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 Group)

LEVEL 25

BURST OF THE SWEEPING FLAMES

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

This spell causes a fire to explode outwards from its source along the ground, as if a giant wind were blowing on it from above. The fire travels for no more than 10 paces, but it ferociously ignites anything in its

path. The original fire is left dead, but in all probability a number of new fires will be started. The flames cause +5 to +15 damage, depending on the intensity of the original fire.

(Base 10(4 + 2 magnitudes for the)intensity of the fire), +3 Sight)

WARD AGAINST HEAT AND FLAMES

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Keeps heat and fire at bay, unable to approach within a couple of inches of the target. This renders the target immune to damage from flames or heat of intensity less than that of molten iron. The target gets a +15 Soak against all fire-related damage. Any fire doing less than +15 damage per round doesn't penetrate the ward. Such fires simply dim at the protected person's passing and flare back up after he or she is gone.

== Imaginem Spells ==

Imaginem is the Form of sensations and illusion. By using Imaginem, you can alter what others perceive. Imaginem, however, means &quot;image,&quot; not &quot;illusion.&quot; Thus, one creates, transforms, perceives, destroys, and controls images, not necessarily illusions. A clairvoyance spell, therefore, is Intellego Imaginem because it detects real images. By manipulating sensations, however, you can create effective illusions. The Art of Imaginem rewards the creative magus by fooling people into actions they would otherwise shun: for instance, they might walk off a cliff, while their eyes tell them there is a bridge over the chasm. Imaginem cannot affect light, as that is part of Ignem, but it can affect the things that light allows you to see.

Stenches and perfumes, tints and stains, color and shadow, melody and cacophony, sweet and sour; all these are perceptions, and so can be manipulated by the Art of Imaginem. An image works on the senses, not on the mind, so an unthinking beast is as likely to believe an image as an imaginative human. Similarly, everyone can sense an illusion created by Imaginem magic. Nevertheless, Imaginem spells are still most effective at fouling the communication on which human society depends. Beasts are likely to be fooled by illusions, as are the simpler undead. Demons are very hard to deceive, while faeries often see through illusions and manipulate them to fool you in turn.

Certain members of the Church have proven remarkably adept at discerning truth from illusion, though the talent is not dependable.

It is more difficult to mimic a specific object or person using an Imaginem spell than it is to mimic a general image. and requires a Perception + Finesse stress roll. For example, it is easier to imitate a generic gold ring than it is to reproduce the gold ring with inscriptions that the baron presented to his wife on the occasion of their tenth wedding anniversary. The higher the roll, the better you can fool people. You get a bonus to your roll for familiarity with what you are mimicking (-3 for an unfamiliar object, +3 for highly familiar objects or for having the subject available for modeling). For mimicking people, a roll against an Ease Factor of 6 lets you fool acquaintances of the person, an Ease Factor of 9 lets you fool friends, and an Ease Factor of 12 lets you fool close friends and relatives. Use a similar scale for mimicking objects. If you botch the Finesse roll, you may think the image is satisfactory, but it's immediately seen through once in use.

A base Individual for Imaginem is the equivalent of an adult human being, whether a visual image of about that size, an auditory illusion making that much noise, or whatever.

PHANTASMAL ANIMAL

R: Voice. D: Diam. T: Ind

Creates an image of any animal or beast up to the size of a pony (Size +1). Under your direct mental command, it moves about (within range) and makes

appropriate noises. You need to be able to concentrate, and be within range, whenever you wish to direct the illusion to move in some manner. If you move out of range or stop concentrating, the illusion just freezes in place. The image does smell like an animal, but it has absolutely no effect on the sense of touch. Of course, a magus may not use this spell to create the image of an animal he or she does not know exists.

Makes an image of a fire (up to the size of a large campfire) that dances, illuminates, crackles, and (apparently) warms. It does not spread, burn, or protect against cold. Makes a great joke at gatherings of House Flambeau, although creating a real fire is even more popular.

Haunt of the Living Ghost

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

Req: Intellego

With this spell, you can instantly project your own image and voice to any designated spot that you have an Arcane Connection to (though troupes may wish to limit this range to some absolute distance like 300 miles). You can see and hear through the image. The image must appear in some medium, such as a fire, mirror, or pool.

<span id="creo-imaginem-guidelines"></span>
== Creo Imaginem Guidelines ==

These spells create and restore images. It is important to note that Creo Imaginem spells only create the images of things, not the things themselves. An image of a bucket will not hold water poured into it, nor will the image of a horse be able to carry a rider. This is often the first (and most important) clue that the image is just an illusion. On the other hand, the illusion of a wall may feel solid, but will present no resistance if someone pushes a hand through it.

Increasing the complexity of a sensory perception, such as making a moving visual image or making clear words instead of noise, adds an additional level of magnitude. Making an image move or make noise at your direction as you concentrate adds two levels of magnitude. In addition, very intricate images (for example, an intricately ornamented bridge) are generally one level of magnitude higher as well.

Wizard's sigils can be very obvious in Creo Imaginem spells. The illusions commonly have some small quirk that marks them as belonging to a certain magus. For example, illusions cast by Fortunatus of Jerbiton often have some small religious icon worked into their structure, due to the manner in which he invents his spells.

Creo Imaginem botches might create obvious illusions which are clearly linked to the caster, thus marking him as a wizard.

Level 1: • Create an image that affects a single sense.

Level 2: • Create an image that affects two senses.

Level 3: • Create an image that affects three senses.

Level 5: • Create an image that affects five senses.

<span id="intellego-imaginem-guidelines"></span>
== Intellego Imaginem Guidelines ==

Generally, these spells have the least to do with illusions of all the Imaginem spells, because one detects an image without altering or controlling it. These spells improve upon your senses by bringing in images (usually sounds and sights) not normally available.

Note that seeing or hearing into another room or a hundred miles away does you no good if there is no light or sound there. As in CrIm spells, each additional sense you wish to perceive increases the level of the spell by one magnitude.

As with most Intellego magic, Intellego Imaginem botches normally give false information.

* General: Discern illusions caused by spells of equal or lower level than the level of this spell (Vision target).
* Level 1: Use one sense at a distance. Memorize or perfect your memory about an image you have encountered.

Some magi use this spell to attend inter-covenant councils without traveling the intervening distance. Because other magi can see you, this spell is not held to constitute scrying by magic. Using it through another covenant's Aegis counts as showing off, however.

THE SHADOW OF HUMAN LIFE R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

The human image created (as in ''Phantasm of the Human Form'') has limited freedom and simulated intellect. It functions as an independent human, albeit a stupid one, capable of interpreting general orders in new situations.

DISCERN THE IMAGES OF TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision

You can tell whether an image has been created or altered through a spell, seeing both the original and false images in the case of alterations. This spell must be at least 1 magnitude higher than an illusion in order to discern it. If you botch the spell, you mistake illusions for the real thing and reality for illusion. Your discernment is not limited to visual illusions, although you can only tell that a sound is illusory if you are looking at the apparent source.

You can see inside a room, as long as you can touch one of its walls. If the room is unlit or poorly lit, you can only see as much as you could if you were inside, but magical enhancements of your senses do apply. You may change your viewpoint within the room throughout the duration of the spell.

EYES OF THE EAGLE

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Vision

You see distant things clearly. No matter how far away something is, you can make out details as if it were only a foot or so from you. Things do not all appear to be a foot away; you can simply make out details as well as if they were. You can still judge distance accurately; in fact, more accurately than normal, to within an inch or so at a distance of several miles, since you can see as clearly as if you were judging distance a foot away.

AURA OF ENNOBLED PRESENCE

The target appears more forceful, authoritative, and believable. Numerous subtle changes in appearance bring about this change, including a slight supernatural illumination of the face, a more erect posture, and a louder and smoother voice. The character gets a +3 on rolls to influence, lead, or convince others.

IMAGE PHANTOM

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Any one thing, including a living thing, can be made to appear as if it were something else of approximately the same shape and size. The illusion cannot be cast on things that have a shape or size improper to the final appearance. If the target moves or is moved in such a way that the illusion is inappropriate, it looks very strange indeed.

(Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

<span id="muto-imaginem-guidelines"></span>
== Muto Imaginem Guidelines ==

These are useful and powerful illusion spells, altering the visual image, noises, smell, or taste of some object or being. The image remains altered without your concentration and adapts itself appropriately to the medium. The accuracy of duplication depends on your knowledge of the subject. For instance, if you want to make a voice like that of a specific person, you must be familiar with the voice that you want to mimic. Those more familiar with the face, voice, body, or other aspect being mimicked might see through an illusion by mundane means (&quot;Duke Tybol, isn't your scar on your left cheek?&quot;).

Muto Imaginem, or indeed other Imaginem magic, cannot overcome the effects of The Gift, although it might offset them a little.

Muto Imaginem botches often change the caster's appearance in dangerous or embarrassing ways.

Level 1:

• Change one sensation of an object (for example, make a leaf look like a coin), but not its type (i.e. not from sight to sound).

Level 2:

Change two sensations of an object.

• Transform species that affect one sense into those that affect another. (For example, transform audible species into visual species, so that sounds can be seen.)

Level 3:

Change three sensations of an object.

Level 4:

• Change four sensations of an object.

Level 5:

Change the appearance of an object completely, in all things except solidity.

<span id="perdo-imaginem-guidelines"></span>
== Perdo Imaginem Guidelines ==

In addition to destroying created images, these spells dull the sensual properties of things — making wine tasteless, sneaks silent, and magi invisible. Destroying changing images is more difficult — add one level of magnitude to spells that do so.

Note that images are naturally generated constantly, so that a Perdo Imaginem spell with Momentary duration merely makes an object seem to flicker for a moment. Longer durations are required if the image is to stay gone.

Note also that shadows are due to the physical body blocking the light. Destroying something's shadow is thus Creo Ignem, or possibly Rego Ignem, not Perdo Imaginem. Mirror images, however, are caused by the species bouncing off the mirror, so a spell destroying (or changing) the species also changes mirror images.

Perdo Imaginem botches might make the image more intense, or destroy the wrong image.

Level 2: • Destroy an object's ability to affect taste or touch.

Level 3: • Destroy an object's ability to affect smell or hearing.

• Destroy an object's ability to affect taste and touch.

Level 4: • Destroy an object's ability to affect sight.

Destroy an object's ability to affect any three of taste, touch, smell, or hearing.

Level 5: • Destroy an object's ability to affect any four senses.

ILLUSION OF COOL FLAMES

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind

A source of heat, such as a fire, seems to lose its heat and drop to the surrounding temperature. It still, however, has its normal beneficial and harmful effects (that is, glowing coals still cook meat or burn a person's hand, though they do not feel hot).

REMOVAL OF THE CONSPICUOUS SIGIL

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part

Grooves, runes, writings, and similar markings are obscured so that they are not visible, but the overall shape of the medium remains constant. For example, runes carved into a sword blade can be made invisible, making the sword appear normal.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 Part)

SILENCE OF THE SMOTHERED SOUND

(Base 2, +2 Voice, +2 Sun)

<span id="wizards-sidestep"></span>
==== WIZARD'S SIDESTEP ====

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind

Your image appears up to 1 pace from where you actually are, so attacks aimed there are likely to miss you. Whenever the image is successfully struck, it disappears and reappears in another spot.

In combat, early attacks are aimed at the image, and so automatically miss you. Once the image has been hit once, you have a +9 bonus to Defense, as attackers must try to find you in a fairly large area.

THE CAPTIVE VOICE

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Part

Captures a person's voice and places it in a bag. The person may not speak unless the bag is open, in which case the voice comes from the bag, not the victim's mouth. If the victim screams while the bag is shut, the bag vibrates visibly.

The target of the spell sees everything vibrate back and forth at varying high speeds. In addition, sounds are displaced and seem to come from the wrong areas. Anyone trying to fight in these circumstances suffers –3 on Attack and Defense scores, and must roll two extra botch dice. The target is likely to become desperate and terribly confused. Navigation is exceedingly difficult. The visual effects of this spell are negated if the target is in complete darkness or if they close their eyes.

IMAGE FROM THE WIZARD TORN

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind

Req: Intellego

Your image separates from your body. It can speak whatever you say and do so in your voice, and you can see through its eyes. You must make an Int + Concentration stress roll for each solid object the image passes through and for each mile it travels. If you wish the image to be able to leave your sight, you must use an Arcane Connection to yourself (for example, a fingernail or a lock of hair) when you cast the spell. That connection becomes an integral part of the image, and when the spell ends, it falls to the ground wherever the image was located.

As your image is away from your body, you are invisible and silent at your actual location. The image is your image, so while you may move it in space you may not have it sit down if you are standing. Further, it appears as if illuminated by whatever light is falling on you, no matter what the level of illumination is at the image.

(Base 10, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +4 Bound)

<span id="rego-imaginem-guidelines"></span>

These spells make things appear to be somewhere other than where they actually are. As with Crlm and Pelm, it is slightly harder to affect changing images. Add one level of magnitude to spells that do so. Add a further level of magnitude if the image is to change along with the object. Add one level of magnitude to the guidelines for each additional sense to be affected.

Rego Imaginem botches might control the wrong image, or do something completely inappropriate to the targeted image.

In addition to healing minds, these spells can also create thoughts, emotions, and memories in another person's mind. These creations interact normally with the target's other thoughts, and may be changed in the process.

Typical sigils for Creo Mentem spells involve some small quirk in what is created. A specific idea may lie in the background of all memories created, for example.

Creo Mentem botches might create inappropriate emotions in the caster's mind.

== Mentem Spells ==

Mentem spells govern thoughts, emotions, and memories. Intelligent minds are affected by Mentem spells, while the minds of beasts are affected only by Animal spells and those of elementals, in so far as they have them, by the appropriate elemental Form. The mental Characteristics are Intelligence, Perception, Presence, and Communication, and they can be affected by Mentem spells.

Since the effects of Mentem spells are not usually visible, they give you a great deal of power when dealing with the common folk. Even spells requiring eye contact are relatively inconspicuous when cast without voice or gestures, but only powerful magi can cast spells this way in the Dominion.

Minds do not have a size, so size modifiers do not apply to Mentem effects with Individual targets. However, minds can be counted, so for Groups you still need to boost the size to affect more people. Similarly, Mentem spells affecting everyone in a Room, Structure, or Boundary have size modifiers in the normal way.

WORDS OF THE UNBROKEN SILENCE

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

(Base 3, +3 Sight)

LEVEL 15

PANIC OF THE TREMBLING HEART

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Creates an overpowering fear in one person of a specific object, person, or place.

(Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

RISING IRE

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Makes the target furious at someone or something of your choice. A stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 using an appropriate Personality Trait (like Calm) can hold the anger in check, but it is felt strongly regardless of the roll.

(Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

LEVEL 20

MEMORY OF THE DISTANT DREAM

R: Eye; D: Sun, T: Ind

Inserts a full and complete memory into a person's mind. If the target gives the memory some thought and concentration, and makes an Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the memory is revealed as false. When the duration expires, the memory vanishes, although the subject may remember remembering it.

(Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

PAINS OF THE PERPETUAL WORRY

R: Eye; D: Moon, T: Ind

Gives someone a nagging, taunting, painful emotion — a recurrent sense of anxiety, a fear of something he or she does not know, a fear of everything, and a fear of nothing. To have this spell cast on you is truly a curse.

(Base 4, +1 Eye, +3 Moon)

LEVEL 25

WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND HELLS

R: Eye, D: Moon, T: Ind

Causes the victim to feel the despair, anguish, pain, and sorrow of a thousand sinners in Hell. This is a horrible spell, for the victim loses almost all motivation and earthly cares. All he can feel is his own pain – endless, inexorable, and searing. Appropriate Personality Trait rolls suffer a harmful adjustment of –5, and the target suffers –2 on any rolls that require thought or concentration. The target has a strong tendency to do nothing but brood.

SIGHT OF THE TRANSPARENT MOTIVE

Detects the general motive most powerfully influencing the target at the moment. General motives are such things as fear, anger, and greed, not specific things like the desire to look good before one's superiors.

<span id="level-15-22"></span>
==== LEVEL 15 ====

Perception of the Conflicting Motives

R: Eve, D: Mom, T: Ind

You can detect the conflicting motives behind one target's actions. Thus you might learn that a guard feels conflict between fear and duty. This spell is often used before application of a Muto or Rego spell, since it is usually easier to change a target's emotions after you've sensed them than it is to create emotions.

<span id="level-20-23"></span>
==== LEVEL 20 ====

FROSTY BREATH OF THE SPOKEN LIE

R: Eye, D: Conc, T: Ind

For as long as you maintain this spell, the target exhales a misty breath with each spoken lie. Small bits of ice form on the person's lips if the lie is particularly severe. In winter, when breath is visible anyway, lies produce a greater than normal amount of mist (the mist actually billows out). A target who makes a Communication + Guile stress roll against an Ease Factor of 15 can

determine whether any given statement will be taken by the spell as a lie. The spell can be defeated through extensive and judicious application of Creo Auram and Perdo Auram spells, and a demon is able to manipulate it in any way it wishes, as demons are the embodiment of deception and are never caught in a lie if they do not wish to be.

House Guernicus brought the Order this spell, and it is a very poor Quaesitor who is without it.

<span id="posing-the-silent-question"></span>
==== Posing the Silent Question ====

R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind

You can ask one silent mental question of the target, then detect the answer. The truth of the answer is limited by the knowledge of the target. Questions to the effect of &quot;What would you do if ...?&quot; often receive inaccurate replies. You are likely to get what the target thinks he would do, not necessarily what he would really do. The target of this spell does not notice the questioning unless he or she resists the spell, in which case they notice the attempt.

(Base 15, +1 Eye)

<span id="level-25-22"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

THOUGHTS WITHIN BABBLE

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Hearing

You can understand the speech of those within the target area. Perception or Communication stress rolls are needed for difficult exchanges. You also understand people who misuse a language that you do speak; you know what they meant to say, as well as hearing what they actually said.

(Base 5, +1 Conc, +3 Hearing)

<span id="level-30-13"></span>
==== LEVEL 30 ====

PEERING INTO THE MORTAL MIND

R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind

You can thoroughly probe and understand the contents of the mind of the target, including his or her immediate and long-term motives, personal strengths and weaknesses, and other pertinent information.

(Base 25, +1 Eye)

<span id="intellego-mentem-guidelines"></span>
=== Intellego Mentem Guidelines ===

These spells are superb for cutting through the confusion of social interaction and the endless banter of the rabble. The InAn spells that deal with the mind may also be used for ideas and guidelines for this section.

Note that writing does not contain any information of itself, and is generally Animal and Herbam or Terram, for the materials, not Mentem. To translate writing, you need someone who can read it, although you could read the translation from their mind.

In general, a momentary Mentem spell can answer a single question, although it is not necessary that the answer be expressible in a brief form. A Momentary spell could, for example, tell you exactly how the target felt about his father, no matter how complex the feeling, but it wouldn't tell you why he felt that way. Finding out a lot of information takes time.

Sigils for InMe spells usually involve information being transmitted in unique ways.

Intellego Mentem botches normally supply false information.

Level 4: • Sense the state of consciousness of one intelligent being (for example, asleep, awake, meditating, dead, drugged, insane, or comatose).

Level 5: • Sense a single emotion in a being.

Understand the meaning behind spoken sounds.

Level 10: • Sense all of the emotions in a being.

• Discover the truth of a statement.

Level 15: • Speak with any one human.

• Read a person's surface thoughts.

• Pick a single answer from the mind of a target.

Level 20: • Read the last day's memories from one person.

Level 25: • Learn all the information you wish from a person's mind.

<span id="muto-mentem-guidelines"></span>
=== Muto Mentem Guidelines ===

Muto Mentem spells give a mind properties it could not naturally acquire. These fall into three main categories.

First, changing memories. While memories may decay over time, they do not naturally change radically, so making them do so is Muto.

Second, emotions and thoughts that people cannot normally feel. This includes the thoughts of animals and similar.

Third, non-mental properties. This covers making a mind physical, and is very difficult.

Muto Mentem botches might change the mind of the caster, thus making this magic potentially very risky.

While Intellego spells can grant magical senses to a single person, granting a magical sense to multiple people is a function of Muto Mentem. The base level is one magnitude higher than the level of an Intellego spell to grant that sense at a Range of Personal and Duration of Momentary, and the Muto Mentem spell has requisites of Intellego and the appropriate Form or Forms. As for all base levels, this is for a spell with Range Personal, Duration Momentary, and Target Individual.

* Level 1: Make a minor change in a person's memory of an event.
* Level 2: Make a major change to a person's memory of an event.
* Level 3: Make a major change to a person's memory of a series of events. Make a major change to a person's emotion.
* Level 4: Make major changes to a person's memory of a period of their life. Completely change a person's emotions.
* Level 5: Turn a single memory or emotion into a solid object. (Requisite of the Form of the shape.) The person whose memory or emotion was transformed must be touching the item to feel the emotion or recall the memory. Other people touching the object do not experience its mental aspects.
* Level 10: Completely rewrite a person's memories.
* Level 15: Make a mind or spirit visible. (Imaginem requisite)
** Utterly change a person's mind.
* Level 25: Make a mind or spirit solid. (Requisite of the Form of the shape.)

LEVEL 4

RECOLLECTION OF MEMORIES NEVER QUITE LIVED

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Changes the target's memory of a detail into a similar, though different, memory. The target is no more sure of this manufactured memory than of the authentic one, so he may discover strange fabrications to be false.

(Base 1, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

LEVEL 30

MIND OF THE BEAST

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Animal

You turn the mind of the target into that of an animal of your choice. The victim acts and thinks like that animal as much as possible, a person who thinks he is a bird will try to fly, but will not be able to. This can be dangerous for the target.

(Base 15, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

LEVEL 35

PAST OF ANOTHER

R: Eye, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual

The target's memories are completely rewritten, and he is unable to remember his actual life until the effect is dispelled or expires.

(Base 10, +1 Eye, +4 Year)

LEVEL 40

INMOST COMPANION

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Req: Animal

The target's mind is made physical as a bird. This bird normally stays close to the target's body, but need not. If the target has Magic Resistance, it protects both his body and mind, as normal. No matter how far it travels, the target's mind controls his body, as well as

the bird's, as normal. In particular, it can see through both sets of sense organs. If the bird is killed, the target also dies, as his mind has been killed.

(Base 25, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

VISION OF THE HAUNTING SPIRITS

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Room

Req: Imaginem

All spirits within the target area become visible, although they might remain unseen if hiding behind something. This includes the spirits of living people, which appear as the person normally does. If the person is invisible or otherwise changed from his normal shape, his normal appearance is superimposed on his current appearance.

(Base 15, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 Room)

Perdo Mentem Spells

'''GENERAL'''

LAY TO REST THE HAUNTING SPIRIT

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

If your spell Penetrates the resistance of a ghost or similar spirit, it loses a number of points from its Might equal to the level of this spell. If this reduces the spirit's Might to zero, it vanishes, apparently destroyed. Philosophers concur that the spirit goes to the afterlife, or is perhaps weakened to helplessness, but is not actually destroyed. Souls, after all, are immortal.

(Base effect)

LEVEL 5

TIP OF THE TONGUE

R: Eye, D: Diam, T: Ind

Causes the target to forget one word of your choosing. The target cannot remember that word for the spell's duration, but afterwards he can come up with the word without assistance by making an Intelligence + Concentration stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9. If the target fails he may try again, but each additional roll adds +1 to the difficulty.

(Base 3, +1 Eye, +1 Diam)

<span id="level-10-18"></span>
==== LEVEL 10 ====

TRUST OF CHILDLIKE FAITH

R: Eye, D: Diam, T: Ind

The target loses judgment and believes almost any passable lie for the duration of the spell. An Intelligence stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 is allowed to resist. Truly incredible lies allow easier resistance rolls.

(Base 4, +1 Eye, +1 Diam)

<span id="level-15-23"></span>
==== LEVEL 15 ====

CALM THE MOTION OF THE HEART

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Removes one emotion from the target until it appears again naturally. An angry person stops being angry, and a curious one stops being inquisitive. Many a magus finds this spell useful for keeping his apprentice's nose out of his immediate business.

(Base 5, +2 Voice)

ENCHANTMENT OF DETACHMENT

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Calms and greatly lowers the intensity of the target's current emotions.

(Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

Loss of But a Moment's Memory

R: Eye, D: Mom, T: Ind

Removes up to five continuous minutes from a target's memory, leaving a blank. You target the loss of memory to a specific event or time. With an Intelligence stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9, the target realizes that memories of a certain period are missing. This Ease Factor can change, depending on how important the missing memory is and what sort of circumstances surrounded the event. Careful introspection over a period of time can allow reconstruction of much of the memory, but some details are lost forever.

(Base 10, +1 Eye)

<span id="level-25-23"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

BLESSING OF CHILDLIKE BLISS

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Reduces an adult mind to a child's level. The target solves problems, reasons, and expresses emotions as would a three-year-old. Magi affected cannot cast spells. At first, anyway, the target is

likely to be happy at having lost a world of cares and troubles that are no longer imaginable.

(Base 10, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

Passion's Lost Feeling

R: Eye, D: Conc, T: Ind

The target is unable to feel any sort of emotion and acts listlessly, without motivation or cares.

(Base 15, +1 Eye, +1 Conc)

<span id="level-40-6"></span>
==== LEVEL 40 ====

BLACK WHISPER

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind

You whisper a magic sentence in the target's ear. It takes several seconds to speak the sentence, so an unwilling, able-bodied target can stop you. If you speak the whole sentence, the target must make a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 15 or go completely insane. You need not use your hands for this spell, but you must be able to speak.

(Base 15, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +1 for not needing to gesture)

<span id="level-65"></span>
==== LEVEL 65 ====

POISONING THE WILL

R: Touch, D: Moon,

T: Bound, Ritual

You curse a place, be it a valley, town, city, or covenant. The curse gradually saps the will and vitality from the people there. They become less energetic, and slowly stop caring about the place, what happens there, other people, and finally themselves. Colors seem more drab and the days longer, and there is an all-pervading sense of boredom and lassitude. Strong-willed individuals and those with strong Personality Traits are less affected, but still suffer to an extent. All Personality Trait rolls while in the area suffer a -3modifier. This spell affects only those who are within the cursed area, including visitors to it. Those who leave the area are overwhelmed by the return of their vigor and sense of purpose.

(Base 4, +1 Touch, +3 Moon, +4 Bound, +5 size)

<span id="perdo-mentem-guidelines"></span>
=== Perdo Mentem Guidelines ===

Emotions naturally reappear in a person, so spells that destroy them must have a continuing duration to ensure that they do not come back. Memories do not naturally return, so Momentary Duration spells remove them forever, although a person could be told what he had forgotten, or reconstruct the memory from things he does remember. A continuing spell would prevent a person from relearning that information, however.

Perdo Mentem botches can destroy more than intended, or destroy elements of the caster's mind.

Level 3: • Remove a minor detail from a person's memory.

Level 4: • Remove an important detail from a person's memory.

• Diminish a single mental capability in a person.

• Reduce the intensity of all of a person's emotions.

Level 5: • Quell an emotion in a person.

Level 10: • Remove a minor or short memory from a person's mind.

• Reduce all of a person's mental capabilities.

Level 15: • Remove a major or long memory from a person's mind.

• Remove all emotions from a person.

• Drive a person insane.

Level 25: • Leave a person a mindless husk.

<span id="rego-mentem-guidelines"></span>
== Rego Mentem Guidelines ==

The Rego Animal spells that deal with the mind may also be used as good guidelines for levels of Rego Mentem spells. Many changes to the mind are Rego effects, because the mind could naturally assume that state.

Rego Mentem botches can change the target's mental state in the wrong way, or change the state of mind of the caster.

* General: Ward against beings associated with Mentem from one supernatural realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)
** Ward against spirits belonging to one realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with a Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)
* Level 3: Make a subtle difference to the target's mental state.
* Control a target's mental state (for Level 4. example, awake, asleep, or confused)
* Level 5: • Control a natural emotion (for example, calm, fear). The target must feel the emotion before you can control it.
** Control a disembodied spirit associated with Mentem, such as most ghosts.
** Incline a person to a particular sort of response.
* Level 10: Control an unnatural emotion (for example, cultivate a person's feelings of bravery where he is usually cowardly).
** Imbue all of a person's responses with a particular emotion.
* Level 15: Control a person as long as you can see them.
** Summon a disembodied spirit associated with Mentem, such as a ghost.

Level 20: • Give a person one complex command, which he tries to carry out to the best of his ability.

RING OF WARDING AGAINST SPIRITS

R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle

Only ghosts and spirits with current Magic Might higher than the spell's level can enter the ring you create. At certain angles, the ring may be seen as an orange-hued dome. This spell does not affect ghosts or spirits associated with the other realms.

(Base effect)

<span id="level-10-19"></span>

THE CALL TO SLUMBER

R: Voice D: Mom, T: Ind

The target becomes sleepy and falls asleep within a few seconds.

(Base 4, +2 Voice)

<span id="snap-of-awakening"></span>
==== SNAP OF AWAKENING ====

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

When you snap your fingers you instantly awaken the target from sleep to alert consciousness. Does not work on someone unconscious from Fatiguelevel loss, wounds, or magic.

(Base 4, +2 Voice)

<span id="level-15-24"></span>
==== LEVEL 15 ====

CONFUSION OF THE NUMBED WILL

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Confuses a person, who must make an Intelligence stress roll to take any direct action. A roll of 12+ ends the spell, while a roll of 9+ lets the character take the intended action, but the spell remains in effect. Any lower roll means the character is confused and takes some other type of action. When it is imperative for the victim to take an action, the storyguide should allow an appropriate modifier to the roll. While under this spell, a character always strikes last in combat and gets at least a -1 on all attacking and defending rolls.

(Base 4, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

<span id="level-20-24"></span>
==== LEVEL 20 ====

AURA OF RIGHTFUL AUTHORITY

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

The target of the spell is strongly inclined to obey you, as if you were his natural superior.

(Base 5, +1 Eve, +2 Sun)

<span id="coerce-the-spirits-of-the-night"></span>
==== COERCE THE SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT ====

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Makes a ghost obey you as long as you can coerce it with threats, such as a threat to defile its grave or to banish it to Hell. The more lurid and dramatic the threat, the more cooperative the ghost is. If the spell penetrates the ghost's Magic Resistance, roll Communication + Leadership to see how effective your threats are. The storyguide should always give a bonus or penalty that depends on the potency of the threat, and any roll other than a botch will compel at least minimal obedience.

(Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)

<span id="scent-of-peaceful-slumber"></span>
==== SCENT OF PEACEFUL SLUMBER ====

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Room

Everyone in the room falls asleep over a few seconds, with the smell of lilacs in their nostrils.

<span id="level-30-14"></span>
==== LEVEL 30 ====

VISIONS OF THE INFERNAL TERRORS

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind

Causes everything the target sees to look and sound terrifying. The world looks basically the same, save that everything is hideously transformed somehow. The target must roll a stress die, adding his Stamina and adding or subtracting an appropriate Personality Trait to see what the effects are. The nature of the Personality Trait used determines how it affects the Stamina roll. A Trait like Brave makes you resistant to fear, while one like Cowardly reduces the result of your roll.

ENSLAVE THE MORTAL MIND

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind

Enables you to completely control the loyalty, emotions, desires, interests, and activities of any person. People revert to normal when the spell ends, and may be extremely angry with the magus.

(Base 25, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)

INCANTATION OF SUMMONING THE DEAD

R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind, Ritual

Calls up a person's ghost. You must be on the spot where the person died, or must have the corpse (either of these constitutes an Arcane Connection). Alternatively, you can summon any ghost that haunts the area you are in, if you know the ghost's full name, according to the Law of Names. Those buried by Church ceremony and those have who gone straight to heaven (that is, saints and crusaders, as opposed to the normal folk who must wait for a time before going on) are not available for summoning. This spell is a ritual because it can summon those who are beyond the mortal world, as long as they are not in heaven.

If the ghost has Magic Resistance, you must penetrate that resistance in order to summon it.

(Base 15, +4 Arc, +1 Conc)

terrain is unsuitable for this spell. Once a searcher spots the hidden place, the spell does not prevent approach. Those who are present for the ritual are unaffected by the spell. This spell mimics the properties of many faerie forests.

<span id="level-55-1"></span>
==== LEVEL 55 ====

EXCHANGE OF THE TWO MINDS

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Group, Ritual

This spell switches the minds (but not the souls) of two creatures. A new body greatly confuses those who are unprepared for the shock, and even those who are ready take a day to adjust completely. Magi who transport their own minds into younger, healthier bodies usually find that having a strong body entails having powerful passions that interfere with the clear thinking needed to pursue the magical Arts. Both people involved must make a Stamina stress roll against an Ease Factor of 3, rolled before the switch is made, to survive the transfer. If only one person fails the roll, that person dies and the spell fails. The other target is unaffected.

<span id="orco-terram-guidelines"></span>
==== Orco Terram Guidelines ====

Creating earth in an elaborate shape or, with a Muto requisite, with some unnatural property is one level of magnitude higher than the listed guidelines.

Wizard's sigils commonly visible in Creo Terram spells involve the object created being bizarre in some way, such as dirt being a specific color or texture.

Creo Terram botches can entomb the caster in earth or stone, as well as creating the wrong sort of material, or creating it in the wrong place.

Level 1: • Create sand, dirt, mud, or clay.

Level 3: • Create stone or glass.

Level 5: • Create base metal.

Level 15: • Create precious metal.

• Repair a crafted item, returning it to an &quot;as new&quot; state.

Create an earth elemental from a base amount of elemental matter. (Ritual)

<span id="intellego-terram-guidelines"></span>
=== Intellego Terram Guidelines ===

Intellego Terram spell levels are not affected by the material of the thing affected, except as explicitly noted in the guidelines.

Intellego Terram botches normally provide false information.

Level 2: • Learn one visible property of an object (a property that someone with appropriate skills could determine just by looking).

<span id="terram-spells"></span>
== Terram Spells ==

Terram spells, in addition to covering earth, stone, clay, metal, and glass, can sometimes affect inanimate objects in general. For instance, Wielding the Invisible Sling (ReTe 10) throws all manner of nonliving things.

Though Terram spells affect all manner of solid objects, it is harder to affect certain materials: Here, in increasing order of difficulty, are the materials Terram spells affect: earth (sand, dirt, mud), clay, stone, glass, metal, gemstones. Each level of difficulty does not necessarily represent an increase in one level of magnitude.

The base Individual for Terram depends on the material involved. For sand, dirt, mud, clay, or similar substances, it is about ten cubic paces of stuff. For stone, it is a single cubic pace. For base metals, it is a cubic foot, while for precious metals it is a tenth of that. For gemstones, the base individual is one cubic inch in size.

Tracks of the Faerie Glow

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision

Causes even faintly perceptible tracks of a specific being to glow with a faint magic light, making them stand out when you are within 30 paces of them. The glow provides a bonus to Tracking rolls, which depends on the relationship between the target being tracked and the terrain. If the target is magically related to the terrain, +2; native to the terrain, +4; neutral to the terrain, +6; inimical to the terrain, +8. Tracking at night without a light source doubles the bonus. The more faint the tracks are, the more dimly they glow, so the storyguide may also modify the bonus based on the length of time since the target passed.

You touch the earth and feel what is moving along the ground within a mile of where you stand. You can tell the direction, distance, weight, number, and manner of movement of moving things. For instance, you

might sense &quot;a single 50-stone creature slithering toward us, a hundred rods in that direction.&quot; This spell is derived from the Terram tradition from which Guernicus the Founder came, and does not fit well into Hermetic theory.

DREAM OF THE MIND THAT SITS R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Reg: Creo

Allows you to probe the memories of a spirit within a natural stone object. The spell also perfects those memories. Probing the memories of such a spirit is extremely slow. A typical session lasts between six and twelve hours, during which the caster is oblivious to the outside world. The spell allows the caster to perceive the memories of the spirit. The spirit's senses are limited and slow, but its memory of them is very long. Using this spell the caster can relive events witnessed by the spirit, as it recalls them. Larger stone objects have more powerful spirits and so have better perceptions. Precisely what level of detail an individual spirit can perceive is up to the storyguide.

THE CRYSTAL DART

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Req: Rego

The spell transforms a stone into a 10-inch crystal dart that rises from the ground at your feet, floats into the air, and speeds off like an arrow at a target that is within Voice range. It does +5 damage (because of the sharp edges of the crystal as much as its speed), and always hits its target, although it must Penetrate Magic Resistance to have any real effect.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Rego requisite)

<span id="muto-terram-guidelines"></span>
=== Muto Terram Guidelines ===

The targets below are for changing dirt. To change to or from sand, mud, or clay, use the same level of magnitude as for dirt. To change to or from stone or glass, add one level of magnitude. To change to or from metal or gemstone, add two levels of magnitude. These adjustments only apply once, so that changing metal to metal is only two magnitudes higher.

The amount of material you can change is limited by the guidelines for each end. Thus, you can turn a cubic pace of stone into a cubic inch of gemstone with a base Individual.

Serious Muto Terram botches have a tendency to turn the caster to stone or metal, but lesser botches transform the wrong thing, or transform things in the wrong way.

General: • Convert part of an earth elemental's body into another type of earth (soil to dust, etc.), reducing the elemental's Might pool by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes. If the elemental is not destroyed by this effect, when the duration ends it can restore this Might by reabsorbing the matter.

Level 1: • Change one property of dirt.

Level 2: • Change dirt to another type of natural earth (for example, sand to loam).

Level 3: • Change dirt so that it is slightly unnatural (requisites may be required).

• Change dirt into a liquid or gas (with requisites).

• Change dirt to stone, or vice versa.

Level 4: • Change dirt so that it is highly unnatural (requisites will often be required).

• Change dirt into a mixture of liquids, solids, and gases (with requisites).

• Change dirt into a plant (with requisites).

• Make something grow to ten times its previous volume.

Level 5: • Change dirt into a slightly unnatural liquid or gas (with requisites).

• Change dirt into an animal (with requisites).

Level 10: • Change dirt into a highly unnatural liquid or gas (with requisites).

Perdo Terram botches, as well as destroying the wrong thing, can destroy the ground that the caster is standing on, or metal objects that he is holding.

General: • Destroy sufficient matter to reduce an earth elemental's Might Score by the level of the spell +2 magnitudes.

Level 2: • Weaken dirt.

Level 3: • Destroy dirt.

Level 5: • Destroy one aspect of dirt, such as its weight or its

==== SUPPLE IRON AND RIGID ROPE ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Makes a flexible object stiff or a stiff object flexible. Casting requisites of Forms appropriate to the materials affected are required. Note that, despite the name, this spell is not high enough level to affect iron.

==== LEVEL 15 ====

<span id="rock-of-viscid-clay"></span>
==== ROCK OF VISCID CLAY ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Part

Softens rock enough that it may be dug out, molded, and otherwise manipulated in the same way that hard river clay can be. The rock is slightly sticky. The spell affects rock in a roughly spherical shape with a three-foot diameter.

==== LEVEL 20 ====

<span id="edge-of-the-razor"></span>
==== EDGE OF THE RAZOR ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Sharpens any metal edge to a degree unequaled by manual methods. An edged or pointed weapon gains a +2 bonus to Damage. Good-natured magi reward grogs by enchanting their weapons in this way, although since the resulting sword is resisted by Magic Resistance they rarely do this for all their grogs.

<span id="object-of-increased-size"></span>
==== OBJECT OF INCREASED SIZE ====

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

This spell enlarges an inanimate object originally no bigger than a large chest. The object doubles in each dimension and increases its weight eight times. The size increase is based on the object's original, natural size, so casting the spell more than once on an object has no effect. Noble elements like gold, silver, and gems, are not affected by this spell. If any part of the item resists growth, the item as a whole does not grow. Casting requisites are required for the appropriate Form for the target.

==== LEVEL 35 ====

<span id="teeth-of-the-earth-mother"></span>
==== TEETH OF THE EARTH MOTHER ====

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

You cause twenty pointed pillars of white marble to spring up from the ground to a height of 12 feet, forming a circle 3 paces in diameter. At their tops, the pillars are thin and as sharp as spears. At the base, where they touch, they are 18 inches thick. When the pillars spring up, they can be used to cage people, to form a wall, or simply to skewer enemies. Climbing to the top of the pillars requires three Dexterity + Athletics stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 12, and the tops break away when the target reaches them, causing

the victim to fall. Skewering a target does +25 damage, possibly more on following rounds if the victim struggles or is exceptionally heavy. When the spell ends, the pillars crumble to dust.

<span id="rusted-decay-of-ten-score-years"></span>
==== RUSTED DECAY OF TEN-SCORE YEARS ====

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

After the spell is cast, the metal of the target becomes so thoroughly rusted that it breaks if used in any demanding way (for example, used to strike a blow in combat or to pry open a door). It also loses any sharpness it might once have had.

(Base 2, +2 metal, +2 Voice)

==== LEVEL 15 ====

<span id="pit-of-the-gaping-earth"></span>
==== PIT OF THE GAPING EARTH ====

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

The dirt in a circle 6 paces across recedes into the ground, leaving a pit 9 feet deep. If the target area contains material other than dirt, that material is not affected.

==== OBLITERATION OF THE METALLIC BARRIER ====

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Reg: Rego

Shatters a barrier of metal or stone up to one foot thick. Those within one pace of the barrier, on the opposite side from you, take +10 Damage. Alchemically refined and magical metals may be able to withstand this spell.

(Base 3, +2 metal, +1 Touch, +1 size, +1 Rego to fling the fragments away)

<span id="stone-to-falling-dust"></span>
==== STONE TO FALLING DUST ====

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind

One solid non-living object turns to a pile of dust. The object must be a base Individual or smaller, so a stone item can be a pace across while a metal item can only be one tenth that size in total. A casting requisite may be required, of the Form appropriate to the target.

(Base 3, +2 metal/gems, +3 Sight)

<span id="level-25-26"></span>
==== LEVEL 25 ====

END OF THE MIGHTY CASTLE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Str

A single stone structure, such as a castle keep or manor house, crumbles to dust and small pebbles. Anyone inside at the time takes +10 damage from falling and having stones land on them, possibly more if the structure is particularly large.

(Base 3, +1 stone, +2 Voice, +3 Str)

<span id="level-40-8"></span>
==== LEVEL 40 ====

CASCADE OF ROCKS

R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Part

Makes a cliff collapse, causing an avalanche. The effects depend on the size of the cliff and what lies below it.

WARD AGAINST FAERIES OF THE MOUNTAIN

R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle

As Ward Against Faeries of the Waters (ReAq Gen), but for faeries of earth and stone. At some angles at night, the ring may be seen as a dark brown dome.

LEVEL 5

UNSEEN ARM

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Slowly moves a nonliving thing, like a mug, instrument, or small pouch of coins; it cannot oppose intentional resistance. Magi use this spell to manipulate things at a distance, but the spell cannot be used to pull something from a person's hand or to move something that is held. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for the target are required.

(Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)

<span id="rego-terram-guidelines"></span>
=== Rego Terram Guidelines ===

The guidelines for controlling dirt, sand, mud, or clay are listed below. Add one magnitude to control stone or glass, and two for metal or gemstones, unless the item is simply being moved from one place to another (as in ''Unseen Arm or either Invisible Sling''). Manipulating objects with great precision may also be higher, depending on the level of precision.

Rego Terram botches often result in the caster being struck by large amounts of flying stone.

General: • Ward against beings associated with Terram from one supernatural realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)

Level 1: • Control or move dirt in a natural fashion

Level 2: • Control or move dirt in a slightly unnatural fashion.

• Keep dirt away from you, under your conscious control (that is, you must be aware of its presence).

• Shape and form dirt, as if a craftsman had worked it.

Level 3: • Control or move dirt in a very unnatural fashion.

Level 4: • Transport a non-living object instantly up to 5 paces. Add one magnitude for 50 paces, two magnitudes for 500 paces, three magnitudes for one league, four magnitudes for seven leagues, and five magnitudes for a place to which you have an Arcane Connection. Casting requisites may be needed if the item is primarily not under the Form of Terram.

Level 5: • Keep all dirt away from your body, or ward a target against dirt.

• Control a disembodied spirit associated with Terram.

• Completely control an earth elemental.

Hurl a hard projectile with enough force to do +5 damage (range increment of 20 paces). This applies magical force to the projectile at the moment of casting, and the projectile then moves naturally.

Level 10: • Hurl a hard projectile with enough force to do +10 damage (range increment of 20 paces).

This applies magical force to the projectile at the moment of casting, and the projectile then moves naturally.

Level 15: • Summon a disembodied spirit associated with Terram.

Hurl a hard projectile with enough force to do +15 damage (range increment of 20 paces). This applies magical force to the projectile at the moment of casting, and the projectile then moves naturally.

<span id="level-10-21"></span>
==== LEVEL 10 ====

TRACKLESS STEP

R: Touch, D: Special, T: Part

You leave no tracks in the earth until you come to a stop, such as to rest or fight. This spell draws on pre-Hermetic traditions, and does not perfectly fit the categories of Hermetic magic.

(Base 2, +1 Touch, +2 Special (based on Concentration), +1 Part)

INVISIBLE SLING OF VILANO

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Hurl a stone (of a size that could be thrown with a mundane sling) at a target within range. Unlike Wielding the Invisible Sling, this spell hurls the stone as a projectile. An aiming roll is required to hit the intended target, but if it succeeds, Magic Resistance offers no protection. The stone inflicts +5 damage on impact and has a range increment of 20 paces.

(Base 5, +1 Touch)

WIELDING THE INVISIBLE SLING

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Hurls any nearby object that could normally be thrown by a person at any target within range. The object must not be held down or otherwise restrained. Damage depends on the object thrown, up to +5 for a fist-sized stone. The object always hits, but it is resisted by Magic Resistance. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for the target are required.

(Base 4, +2 Voice)

THE FORGIVING EARTH

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Loosens earth in a 15-pace-by-15-pace area to a depth of one foot, making packed dirt as loose as plowed ground.

(Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +1 size)

THE UNSEEN PORTER

R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

Like ''Unseen Arm'' (ReTe 5), but it can carry large objects such as crates. Roughly speaking, it has

the capabilities of a very strong person (Str +5). The heavier the object is, the slower the unseen porter moves. If delicacy is required, high Finesse stress rolls (Ease Factor 12 or so) are needed. The spell can only carry inanimate objects, and cannot carry you. It also cannot lift things more than 6 feet above the ground. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for the target are required.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Conc)

UNYIELDING EARTH

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Compacts the surface of the ground in a 15-pace-by-15-pace area to a depth of one foot, making it more solid. Mud becomes as soft earth, and soft earth becomes as packed dirt.

(Base 2, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +1 size)

LEVEL 15

THE EARTH'S CARBUNCLE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Req: Muto

Causes a 1-pace circle of ground to become jagged stone, just under the surface, and those fragments burst into the air. Anyone standing on the circle is thrown into the air and hit with flying debris. Damage is +10.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +1 Muto requisite)

HANDS OF THE GRASPING EARTH

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Part

Reg: Muto

Earthen hands from beneath the target rise out of the ground, and grasp the target's ankles. To break free requires a Strength stress roll of 15+. (One attempt is allowed per round, and each requires a Fatigue roll.) Each hand can be destroyed by beating its +25 Soak roll (hacking weapons do double normal damage) and inflicting a Light Wound.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +1 Part, requisite free)

LEVEL 20

CREST OF THE EARTH WAVE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Creates a wave in the earth that starts at your feet and travels out to the range of your Voice in a designated direction. It starts as a narrow ripple and within 5 paces reaches its full size of 5 feet high and 30 paces wide. It moves about 50 paces per round. Those caught in its path must make Dexterity stress rolls against an Ease Factor of 12 to leap over the wave, or they are tossed aside and take +10 Damage. The wave overturns trees and damages buildings in its path.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +2 size)

LEVEL 30

CREEPING CHASM

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Creates a chasm that runs from the ground in front of your feet towards some target within range that you designate. The chasm travels about 4 paces per round, growing wider as it travels, reaching a maximum width of 20 feet at a distance of 30 paces. The chasm is 20 to 30 feet deep, and the sides are likely to collapse, so any caught in it are in a bit of a bind. To avoid the growing chasm, a target must make a Quickness stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9. The spell effect lasts a moment, creating the stresses that then open the chasm over a few rounds. The normal forces of the earth tend to close the chasm in a week or so, but may not in some locations.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +3 size, +1 fancy effect)

EARTH SHOCK

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part

Shakes the ground in a 100 pace radius. All affected by this spell must make a Quickness - Encumbrance stress roll against an Ease Factor of 10 or fall. Apply these modifiers: standing still, +2; on solid stone, +2; moving slowly, +0; on earth, +0; running, -2; standing on a narrow bridge, -6.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Part, +4 size)

THE EARTH SPLIT ASUNDER

R: Voice, D: Spec, T: Part

Creates a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long, 10-foot-deep crack in the ground. It opens on one round, stays open for another round, and closes at the start of a third round, crushing all within it for +25 damage. You must maintain concentration for all three rounds, or the pit slowly closes, over an hour's time, rather than shutting quickly and violently. To avoid the pit, those in its vicinity other than the caster must make a Quickness stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Falling in incurs +5 damage. To escape, another such roll is made. Unless outside help is provided, people in the pit only get one chance to escape.

(Base 3, +2 Voice, +1 Special based on Mom, +1 Part, +2 size, +1 fancy effect)

==== LEVEL 75 ====

HERMES' PORTAL

R: Arc, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual

Creates a magical portal through which people, animals, and objects can travel almost instantaneously. The ritual must be cast twice, simultaneously at two different locations, and after the rituals are performed, there is a magical connection between them. The magi conducting each ritual must have an Arcane Connection (such as a clod of dirt) to the other location when they are conducting the ritual. The portal is activated by some command word or ritual determined when the portal is enchanted. Inanimate things and unwilling creatures may be transmitted if someone else says the command word, and pushes the subject through.

(Mercurian Ritual)

<span id="vim-spells"></span>
== Vim Spells ==

Vim spells are very useful. They help you use your spells to better effect, and since using spells efficiently is what being a master magus is all about, these spells are very important. With imagination, you can use these spells to make wards, alarms, one-use magic items, and other interesting things. Many Vim spells are meant to be cast along with other spells, and modify or change their effects.

Vim magic also encompasses dealing with demons. Summoning and dealing with demons is prohibited within the Order, but fighting them is allowed.

Magi often use Vim to counteract magical phenomena. Storyguides should assign spell levels for all magical phenomena that those using Vim counterspells will have to match.

Most Vim spells are of General level, because the magic that Vim spells affect varies widely in power. A spell to dispel a first magnitude spell needs to be much less powerful than a similar spell to dispel a fifth magnitude effect. The guidelines provided for Vim spells take account of this, and rather than giving an absolute level for a corresponding effect, they give the relationship that the level of the Vim spell must bear to the level of the target.

As usual, these guidelines refer to a spell with the basic Range, Duration and Target. When changing these parameters the change in level should be taken account of before multiplying or dividing the spell level to get the effect. Thus, a version of ''Wind of Mundane Silence'' (PeVi) with Sight range would dispel a spell with a level of up to half (spell level – 5 + stress die). Ten levels of the spell's power are devoted to increasing the Target to Room, and 15 to increasing the Range to Sight, and only the remaining power is available for the spell.

The Individual target for a Vim spell can refer to either an individual spell, or an individual object or person, and similarly for Group. If the target is an object or person, the Vim spell will affect any suitable magic affecting that

<span id="oren-vim-guidelines"></span>
==== Oren Vim Guidelines ====

There are few Creo Vim spells known throughout the Order.

Creo Vim botches often give the caster additional Warping Points, as the raw magic runs out of control.

* General: Create a magical shell which looks real to Intellego spells with a level less than or equal to twice its level, plus one magnitude (this aura is generic 'magic' only — no misleading information can be supplied).
** Create a magical shell which prevents Intellego spells with a level less than or equal to its level, plus one magnitude from learning any details about the magic on the target.
** Create a magical shell which gives false information about the target to Intellego spells with level less than or equal to half its (level plus one magnitude).
** Refreshes all spell traces within the target that are less then the magnitude of the guideline -1, in negative magnitude. This restores them to their initial strength, generally half the magnitude of the spell (see the Intellego Vim guidelines)

<span id="level-3-1"></span>
==== Level 3: ====

• Taint something with magic.

<span id="level-4-1"></span>
==== Level 4: ====

• Create a temporary Arcane Connection to a target within range. This Arcane Connection cannot be fixed in a laboratory, and does not itself give a bonus to Penetration. It does, however, allow the magus to use other methods to boost Penetration, and to use other spells on the target even if the magus can no longer perceive it. Note that this spell must Penetrate the target's Magic Resistance, if any, like any other spell.

<span id="level-5-19"></span>
==== Level 5: ====

* Create a burst of magic that gives the target one Warping Point. Spells that grant Warping cannot have a duration of greater than Momentary. Note that doing this to a magus is an attack, and clearly against the Code.
* Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were one step higher on the table on page 220. If this increases the Duration to Years or greater, the duration of the connection continues to be measured in a period of years. Hermetic magic can not make an Arcane Connection last indefinitely without fixing the connection as described in the Laboratory chapter (page 250). Note that the range is the range to the Arcane Connection, and you must know what you are targeting just like any other spell.
* Level 10: Give the target two Warping Points.
** Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were two steps higher on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above.
* Level 15: Give the target three Warping Points.
** Decrease the rate of decay of an Arcane Connection as if the connection were three steps higher on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above.

person, not just one spell. Most such spells can only be cast on either other spells or individuals, but, if the description suggests that they could be cast on either, then they can. For example, Mirror of Opposition can only be cast on other spells, while The Phantom Gift can only be cast on people.

Spells and magical effects do not have sizes, so size modifications do not apply to the levels of Individual Target Vim spells. However, Vim spells affecting areas, or number of spells, must be increased in level for large areas or large numbers, as normal.

The guidelines below refer mainly to spells. This is for the sake of brevity, as Vim spells can affect magical effects proceeding from magical items, magical creatures, or demons. However, unless specifically stated otherwise, the spells do not affect magical items, only the effects that they produce. Thus, Wind of Mundane Silence could dispel a stone wall produced by a magical item, but Disenchant is needed to dispel the magic of the item itself.

It should be noted that Hermetic magi, and most non-Hermetic wizards, do not have Might scores, and thus are not affected by wards or other spells that act against Might scores.

R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Circle

Once a spell trace has been found or suspected, this spell is used to make it examinable. This spell temporarily restores spell traces to a fresh state (as if they had just expired). The spell will restore spell traces of negative magnitude up to the magnitude of this spell -3. The trace must still be existent to be affected (magnitude -9 or greater).

Versions of this spell also exist for all standard Targets. Diameter duration is normally long enough to conduct Intellego Vim investigations of the spell traces.

<span id="shell-of-false-determinations"></span>
==== SHELL OF FALSE DETERMINATIONS ====

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

Creates a &quot;shell&quot; of magic on an item, helping to shield it from investigation by other magi. All attempts to investigate the magic item give false information about its powers unless half of the level of the shell is exceeded by the magus's Investigation roll.

==== SHELL OF OPAQUE MYSTERIES ====

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

This spell is similar to Shell of False Determinations (above), but it causes all attempts to investigate the magic item to utterly fail, unless the level of the ritual is exceeded by the magus's Investigation roll. Once a magus determines the presence of a particular shell (that is, by overcoming it), it has no more power against him or her.

The target of the spell becomes tainted with magic as most magi are. Beasts and people react to the target as though he were a magus. Those who normally associate with the victim do not become hostile, but do give him or her a wider berth. The spell has no effect on those who already have The Gift, including those blessed with the Gentle Gift.

Although the burst of magic that causes the Warping lasts but a moment, the resulting Warping is permanent.

THE INVISIBLE EYE REVEALED

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Touch

The caster can feel any magical means currently being used to spy on him. The representation varies in a way that depends on the spell, but it often feels like something touching the magus's back. For example, a magus being spied upon with Enchantment of the Scrying Pool might feel wet fingers, while a magus who is being tracked by The Inexorable Search might feel a finger running over his skin. This spell detects the use of Intellego spells of up to double the level of this spell. A special spell is required because most Intellego spells are designed to be subtle, and they are more subtle at higher levels.

Scales of the Magical Weight

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

When casting this spell, you typically hold your hands straight out from your body, place a known amount of Vim vis in your left hand (usually one pawn), and then place an unknown amount of vis in your right hand. After casting the spell, you may sense how heavy the unknown vis is in relation to the known, determining the number of pawns present. If you cast the spell without anything to measure the unknown vis against, you only have a very general idea of how valuable it is. The spell cannot be used to determine the amount of raw vis invested in an enchanted item.

(Base 4, +1 Touch)

<span id="intellego-vim-guidelines"></span>
=== Intellego Vim Guidelines ===

Since magic is a tricky thing to understand, spells that detect magic are at once difficult and important. Although demons deal in Vim, they are made of the essence of deception itself. If a demon does not wish to be detected, it cannot be (at least to the common knowledge of the Order), and for this reason there are no demon-locating magics. Magic items cannot be investigated with simple magic spells. Investigation requires that you spend at least one season in the laboratory to discover what magic an enchanted item contains (see the Laboratory chapter). A spell will suffice to tell you that an item is magical, however, and may give you some idea of its powers. Spells will never tell you how to use an item.

The base level of a spell to detect magic also gives a fairly good idea of the strength of the magic (within a magnitude). The addition of one magnitude will say whether the effect is Hermetic, and a magus familiar with other types of magic will be able to identify them as well. The addition of two magnitudes will give information about Technique and Form, or nearest equivalent for other types of magic. The addition of three magnitudes gives the rough details of the effect and the sigil of the caster, and reveals whether a Hermetic effect was created by a spell or invested device. A magus with extensive experience of a particular kind of non-Hermetic magic can do the same for that, the spell reveals the information, but the caster may not be able to interpret it. Further increases in level yield further information, depending on the design of the specific spell.

Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects.

Different spells may be invented to detect Faerie, Divine, or Infernal effects. Each spell only affects one realm, and storyguides may wish to disallow spells to

detect the Divine or Infernal.

As a general rule, residues of magic decline as follows. As soon as the magic finishes, the magnitude halves. It then drops by one for every duration of the spell that passes. Once this reaches zero, the residues decline more slowly. Residues of non-Ritual Momentary, Concentration, and Diameter Duration drop by one every month, while residues of other effects drop by one every year. A 'negative magnitude' of 10 indicates that the residue has disappeared completely, and no longer exists to be detected.

Magical items have an effective residue magnitude equal to the number of pawns of vis used to open the enchantment (or the total pawns used for lesser enchanted devices). Magnitudes of non-Hermetic items must be set by the storyguide. A spell to detect items will not also detect effects or creatures, and vice-versa. Variants will detect items enchanted by different Realms, as above.

Magical creatures can also be detected. Treat their Might as the level of the effect; for Hermetic magi, use their highest Art. Divide Might or highest Art by five (rounding up) to get the effective residue magnitude. Again, this requires a dedicated spell, and variants may detect Faerie and possibly Divine creatures. Demons may not be detected. Troupes may, at their option, allow spells that detect other Infernal creatures, such as diabolists and undead.

Raw vis will show up as magical, simply as raw vis, under any magical detection. The level of the detecting spell is irrelevant, as is the realm of power that it was designed to detect. However, only specially designed spells will yield any information other than that it is raw vis.

Intellego Vim botches generally give false information.

* '''General:''' Detect the traces of magic of negative magnitude up to the magnitude of the guideline used -2.
* Level 1: Detect magic of tenth magnitude or higher.
** Detect the presence of a supernatural aura.
** Detect the presence of vis. As concentrated magic, vis is not hard to spot.
* Level 2: Detect magic of eighth magnitude or higher.
** Determine the power of a supernatural aura.
* Level 3: Detect magic of sixth magnitude or higher.
** Detect regio boundaries. If cast with a Vision target, this provides enough information to find a way between levels, for regiones that allow that sort of entrance. Otherwise, it reveals the presence of a regio, and possibly its rough shape.
* Level 4: Detect magic of third magnitude or higher.
** Judge the amount of vis present.
** Discern the Art of vis.
* Level 5: Detect any active magic.

= Muto Vim Spells &amp; Enchanted Devices =

Muto Vim spells affect other spells, and can also affect spell-like effects instilled in enchanted devices, as long as certain conditions are met.

A Muto Vim effect can be put into a magical item, as long as it affects another power instilled in the item. If spell-like powers in a magical item can be manipulated by Muto Vim effects, then spell-like powers can also be manipulated by Muto Vim spells. The reverse is not true; a general purpose Muto Vim spell-like effect cannot be instilled in a magical item with the intent to affect spells that the wielder desires to target. Muto Vim spell-like effects can only affect other spell-like effects in the same magical item.

If the magus casting the Muto Vim spell is the same person activating a magical item, then the standard rules for casting a Muto Vim spell apply. The caster must succeed with an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9.

If the magus is not the same person activating the magical item, the rules governing a Muto Vim spell cast on another magus' spell apply. If an ally activates the magical item, and the magus and item-activator have worked out the timing issues before hand, the two are considered to be cooperating. The caster must succeed with an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9.

If the caster and the item-activator have not worked out the timing issues beforehand, then they are not cooperating. An enemy using a magical item falls into this category. In this case, the magus must fast cast the Muto Vim spell. He must also beat the magical item's Penetration with his Muto Vim spell's Penetration. Because most Muto Vim spells are Form specific, he must also correctly identify the Form of the device's spelllike effect. Use the Determining Form of Magical Effect formula (page 217) to determine whether the magus is successful. If the magus correctly identifies the Form, succeeds with a fast cast defense roll against the item-activator's Initiative roll, and casts his spell with higher Penetration than the device's Penetration, his Muto Vim spell affects the device's spell-like effect.

All other Muto Vim spell rules apply. The magical item must be Hermetic. The Muto Vim spell can have Range Touch if the magus is holding the magical item, but must have Range Voice, at least, if someone else is holding the magical item or he triggers it from a distance.

SENSE THE NATURE OF VIS

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

You can tell what Art a supply of raw vis is connected to. To you, the vis appears to glow with an aura that is appropriate to the Technique or Form that the vis is associated with. Creo is white, Intellego gold, Muto constantly fluctuating, Perdo black, Rego purple, Animal brown, Aquam blue, Auram violet, Corpus dark red, Herbam green, Imaginem pearly blue, Ignem bright red, Mentem orange, Terram dark brown, and Vim silver. Some of the colors are very similar, but are easy to distinguish if the item is held steadily and studied for a few seconds.

PIERCING THE FAERIE VEIL

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision.

This spell allows the caster to see through the boundaries of Faerie regiones, and therefore divine the path to the next level (more details about regiones are given on page 420). There are separate but related spells for Divine, Magical and Infernal regiones.

SENSE OF THE LINGERING MAGIC

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Hearing

This spell can detect the presence of many magical residues, even from weak spells, as well as giving the presence and power of active spells. It does not grant any information apart from the power, however. The residue must be of at least zero magnitude.

==== LEVEL 40 ====

SIGHT OF THE ACTIVE MAGICS

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Vision

You can see spells as &quot;auras&quot; around things and people. The color of the aura indicates the Form of the spell working on a subject, the color matching the appropriate one described in Sense the Nature of Vis (page 367). The Technique of a spell working on the subject is recognized by the aura's shape, not color. Creo and Rego are both very orderly auras. Muto is constantly shifting, and Intellego usually is as well, but more slowly. A Perdo aura is usually in fragments. Thus, a magus with both Endurance of the Berserkers and The Invisible Eye Revealed upon him has a very controlled, orderly aura of deep red around his or her entire body, and the magus's eyes are surrounded with slowly shifting auras of a silvery hue. You should be warned: Imaginem or Vim spells may be used to disguise auras. Also note that this spell will detect the residues of some spells.

MIRROR OF OPPOSITION (FORM)

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Cast on another spell while the other spell is being cast, this causes the targeted spell to have the exact opposite of its normal effects. This effect works on spells up to half the (level – 5) of the ''Mirror of Opposition'' spell. The effects of the inversion are up to the storyguide to determine, but the target of the inverted spell usually remains the same as that of the original spell. The inverted spell cannot overcome any limitations of Hermetic magic. For example, if a Momentary Perdo Corpus spell is cast, the inversion is probably a Creo Corpus spell of Sun duration. There are ten versions of this spell, each affecting spells of one of the Hermetic forms.

<span id="shroud-magic"></span>
==== SHROUD MAGIC ====

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

This spell allows a magus to suppress or alter the sigil in a spell that is currently being cast. The spell to be shrouded can be up to double the Shroud's level, and ''Shroud Magic'' has the same sigil (or lack of) as that given to the shrouded spell.

<span id="the-sorcerers-fork"></span>
==== THE SORCERER'S FORK ====

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

This spell splits another spell (whose level must be less than or equal to the level of this spell) into two or more identical spells of reduced power, which may be cast against two or more separate targets. Each resulting spell has the same Range and Target (target category, that is — the actual target may be different) as the original spell, but the power of the effect is divided by the number of resulting split spells. The precise effect is at storyguide discretion. One casting die is rolled, and the Penetration total is split between the spells. The Sorcerer's Fork must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell that is to be split. The split spell has a targeting penalty as for multiple casting (see page 225). If the casting magus is not cooperating, all the split spells will strike the original target.

<span id="wizards-boost-form"></span>
==== WIZARD'S BOOST (FORM) ====

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

You cast this spell as another spell of a level less than or equal to this one is cast. The effect of the other spell increases 5 levels in power, but not past the level of the Wizard's Boost. The effects of the extra 5 levels of power are for the storyguide to determine. A Wizard's Boost may never affect a single spell more than once. There are ten versions of this spell, one for each Hermetic Form.

<span id="muto-vim-guidelines"></span>
=== Muto Vim Guidelines ===

These spells let you change other spells.

These meta-magical spells have certain special restrictions, which apply to all Muto Vim spells invented according to Hermetic theory. First of all, they cannot be cast on Spontaneous spells. Such magic is being manipulated at whim-any attempt to alter it further would make the caster lose control. (This is necessary for game balance.)

Second, you must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 9 if you are casting both spells (that is, the MuVi spell and the spell it is affecting). If this fails, the spells do not go off. If it botches, they botch. (This is slightly easier than normal.)

If you wish to cast one of these spells on a spell being cast by another magus, you must either be co-operating, or you must fast cast the MuVi spell. There is no other way to get the timing right. In addition, your Penetration total for the Muto Vim spell must beat the other magus's Penetration total for the spell to be changed, unless you are co-operating.

Touch range is sufficient to affect your own spells, but Voice range, at least, is needed to affect another magus's casting. You cannot touch the spell itself.

These spells can only be used on Hermetic magic, as they depend on a good understanding of the processes involved.

You may only put a Muto Vim effect into a magical item if it is to work with another effect in that item. All Muto Vim spells require some tailoring to the specific use, and a magical item effect cannot be so tailored.

Note that a spell invented according to one of the guidelines below will change another spell in a specific way: it is not possible to invent a single spell which changes another spell however the caster wants. See the example spells for ideas on how specific this should be.

It is not possible, for reasons that Hermetic theorists do not well understand, to use Muto Vim to affect another spell after it has been cast.

If the parameters of an effect after it has been changed by a Muto Vim spell would normally require a Ritual, then at least one of the original spell and the Muto Vim spell must be a Ritual. For example, a Formulaic or Spontaneous Muto Vim effect on a Formulaic spell cannot produce an effect that would normally require a Ritual.

Muto Vim botches can have any conceivable effect, as they alter the

other spell in unpredictable ways.

Muto Vim spells work by altering the magical energies that create the spell as it is being cast. The spell is the result of the combination of the base casting and the Muto Vim effect, and has its effect once both the casting and the Muto Vim effect have finished. This means that a Muto Vim spell must have a duration at least as long as the casting of the target spell, but need not last for as long as the spell itself. For normally-cast formulaic spells, a Momentary Duration is sufficient, but if the casting time is longer for any reason, the Muto Vim spell must also have a longer Duration; Sun is sufficient for any practical Ritual.

An increase in power or parameters may not raise the level of the

target spell above the level of the Muto Vim spell.

<span id="general-13"></span>
==== General: ====

* Superficially change a spell of less than or equal to twice the (level + 1 magnitude) of the Vim spell. This may not change the primary effect of the spell, or its power.
* Significantly change a spell of less than or equal to the level + 1 magnitude of the Vim spell. This may not change either the Technique or Form of the target spell. A change in power of plus or minus one magnitude is a significant change, as is a change of target, if the target was possible for the original spell.
* Totally change a spell of less than or equal to half the (level + 1 magnitude) of the Vim spell. This may change the Technique, Form, or both of the target spell, and needs no requisites for those Arts. The Vim spell affects the structure of the spell, not the things that the spell targets. A change in power of up to two magnitudes is a total change. Any greater change requires either Creo or Perdo to create more magical energy or destroy some.

<span id="perdo-vim-guidelines"></span>
==== Perdo Vim Guidelines ====

Most Perdo Vim spells are specific to one of the four Supernatural Realms. If you want to cast a Perdo Vim spell on a character who has Magic Resistance, you must overcome the Magic Resistance.

General:

* Make something (including a magical item) seem non-magical to any Intellego spell of less than or equal to twice the (level + 2 magnitudes) of this spell.
* Dispel effects of a specific type with a level less than or equal to the level + 4 magnitudes of the Vim spell + a stress die (no botch). A specific type could be Hermetic Terram magic, or Shamanic spirit control magic. A magus must have some knowledge of a type of magic (although not necessarily ability to use it) to invent a spell to affect it. All Hermetic magi have some knowledge of all Hermetic magic.
* Reduce a target's Might Score by the level of the spell + 2 magnitudes, as long as the spell penetrates the creature's Magic Resistance.
* Reduce a target's Might Pool by the level of the spell + 2 magnitudes, as long as the spell penetrates the creature's Magic Resistance.
* Dispel any supernatural effect of one realm with a level less than or equal to half the (level + 4 magnitudes + a stress die (no botch)) of the Vim spell.
* Reduce the casting total for all supernatural powers of one realm cast by the target by half the (level + 2 magnitudes) of the spell. If two or more such spells affect one target, only the highest has any effect: the penalties do not add. The spell must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance in order to have any effect.
* Reduce the casting total for a specific type of supernatural effect (such as Hermetic magic) cast by the target by the (level + 2 magnitudes) of the spell. If two or more such spells affect one target, only the highest has any effect: the penalties do not add. The spell must penetrate the target's Magic Resistance in order to have any effect. A maga must be familiar with a type of supernatural effect to invent a spell to affect it.
* Age a spell trace to a negative magnitude equal to the guideline used (for example, -2 for a level 10 guideline).
* Dispel a Hermetic enchantment with a level less than the guideline level used + 1 magnitude + a stress die (no botch). The spell must be a Ritual.
* Dispel a specific type of enchantment with a level less than twice the guideline level used + 2 magnitudes + a stress die (no botch). The spell must specify a particular Hermetic Form or a specific type of enchantment, such as Talismans, Familiars or Longevity Rituals. More general enchantments do not qualify. Spell must be a Ritual.
* Dispel Hermetic Form Resistance aligned to a given Form with a level less than or equal to the level of the Vim spell + 2 magnitudes + a stress die (no botch). Spell must penetrate the Vim-based Magic Resistance of the target.
* Dispel Magic Resistance from a Might score aligned to one Realm with a level less than or equal to the level of the Vim spell + 4 magnitudes + a stress die (no botch). Spell must penetrate the Vim-based Magic Resistance of the target.
* Destroy an amount of raw vis equal to the level of the spell.

Level 5:

• Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by one step on the table on page 220. If this reduces the duration below Hours, the connection expires immediately. Does not work on connections that naturally have Indefinite duration, but can make an Arcane Connection that was fixed in the laboratory expire. Note that the Range is the range to the Arcane Connection, and you must know what you are targeting, just as for any other spell.

Level 10:

• Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by two steps on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above.

Level 15:

• Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by three steps on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above.

Level 20:

Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by four steps on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above.

Level 25:

• Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by five steps on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above.

Level 30:

• Reduce the duration of an Arcane Connection by six steps on the table on page 220, subject to the same limits as above. This level of effect is sufficient to make almost any Arcane Connection expire instantly.

<span id="wizards-communion"></span>
==== WIZARD'S COMMUNION ====

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Group

This spell lets magi combine their power to cast spells. The group of magi work together to cast a specified spell through the unified power of the Communion. Only one extra magus may join the Communion for each 5 levels of the specified spell being cast. One of the magi in the group must also know the specified spell, or cast it from a Casting Tablet (page 263).

Only one magus in the group needs to cast the spell. The magus who casts the Wizard's Communion need not be the one who casts the main spell, and normally it is better for them to be different. More than one magus in the group may cast this spell. In this case, add the total levels of successfully cast Wizard's Communion to get the effective level of the Wizard's Communion for this casting. This combined total must be at least twice the level of the specified spell being cast.

One magus must roll for success as if casting the specified spell himself. However, the target number for the spellcasting roll is the spell's level divided by the number of magi participating in the Communion. So if five magi participate to cast a 50th level spell, the caster would have to successfully cast a 10th level spell — with all the relevant requisites, of course. This method of casting adds one botch die per magus participating. If the spell botches, all participants gain Warping Points and must check for Twilight if they gain two or more.

Communion is a remnant of Mercurian rituals, so it does not perfectly fit into the guidelines of Hermetic theory.

(Base effect)

WIZARD'S REACH (FORM)

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

The range of the targeted spell increases by one category. You may not affect a single spell more than once with this spell, and the targeted spell must be at least one magnitude lower in level than this spell. There are ten versions of ''Wizard's Reach'', one for each Form.

(Base effect, +2 Voice)

WIZARD'S VIGIL

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group

This spell functions as ''Wizard'''s ''Communion'', except that the longer duration allows it to be used with Ritual spells. For the purposes of its effect, treat it as a ''Wizard'''s ''Communion'' of two magnitudes lower.

'''GENERAL'''

DEMON'S ETERNAL OBLIVION

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

Weakens and possibly destroys a creature with Infernal Might. If the spell penetrates the creature's Magic Resistance, the creature loses Might Score equal to the spell's level.

(Base effect, +2 Voice)

DISENCHANT

R: Touch, D: Mom,

T: Ind, Ritual

You make a Hermetic magic item lose all its powers permanently if the level of this spell + a stress die (no botch) equals or exceeds the highest level of the enchantments in the item. The enchantment is utterly destroyed, as is all of the vis that was used in the magic item. The object left is in all ways a mundane item, but could be invested with enchantments again at a later time.

(Base effect, +1 Touch)

Masking the Odor of Magic

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

Prevents the detection of a magic spell, or of a magic power in an item or being, by InVi magic, unless the level of the InVi spell exceeds twice the level of this spell – 5 (for example, exceeds 20 for a level 15 version).

(Base effect, +1 Touch, +2 Sun)

UNRAVELLING THE FABRIC OF (FORM)

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind

This spell will cancel the effects of any one spell of a specified Form whose level is less than or equal to (spell level + 10 + stress die (no botch)). There are 10 variants that cover each Hermetic Form, and a number of much rarer

variants for different kinds of non-Hermetic magic.

(Base effect, +2 Voice)

WIND OF MUNDANE SILENCE

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Room

You raise a metaphorical &quot;breeze&quot; that blows the magic away from an area, canceling the effects of any spell there. You can cancel the effects of any spell if, with this spell, you can double the level of the spell on a stress die + the level of your spell. The spell must Penetrate to affect effects on a creature with Magic Resistance, including Parma Magica. If the spell penetrates, and its level + the stress die is double Parma Magica x 5, then this spell dispels the Parma Magica. Wind of Mundane Silence does not affect spells of Momentary duration. Magical things near the area of the Wind wave slightly from the &quot;breeze.&quot;

Aegis of the Hearth

R: Touch, D: Year,

T: Bound, Ritual

This ritual protects a covenant in a way similar to the way in which a Parma Magica protects a magus. It provides very strong protection against supernatural effects and creatures that originate from outside the boundary of the Aegis, and much weaker and less consistent protection against supernatural effects originating within the Aegis. The ritual also allows certain individuals to be excluded from the effects of the Aegis, so that it does not hinder their supernatural powers at all. These individuals are referred to as &quot;natives&quot; of the Aegis in this description, and other individuals, and the effects they create, are referred to as &quot;foreign&quot;. &quot;Native&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot; are determined for a particular casting of an Aegis. Each casting of Aegis of the Hearth determines who and what is native and foreign without reference to any

<span id="rego-vim-guidelines"></span>
== Rego Vim Guidelines ==

Rego Vim spells repel demons and other supernatural creatures. Theoretically, it is possible to conjure and control demons through Rego Vim spells, but this knowledge and its use are forbidden by the Hermetic Code. Any who find and dare to use this knowledge face dangers from both the beings they deal with and those in the Order of Hermes who strongly object to such practices.

Rego Vim would also be the combination of Arts that granted Magic Resistance, but not even Bonisagus was able to turn Parma Magica into a spell. ''Aegis of the Hearth'' is the best that has been managed, and that spell is not fully integrated into Hermetic theory.

General:

* Ward against all supernatural beings from one realm (Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic) with Might less than or equal to the level of the spell. (Touch, Ring, Circle)
* Sustain or suppress a spell you have cast whose level is less than or equal to the level + 2 magnitudes of the Vim spell. This, and the similar guidelines below, cannot make a spell last longer than it could have naturally, and so the sustaining version is only useful with Concentration Duration, among the standard Hermetic Durations. Similarly, a spell that has been suppressed still ends when its original duration expires.
* Create a conduit or container for spells with level less than or equal to the level + 5 magnitudes of the Vim spell. A conduit puts you in mystical contact with the target (effective Touch range), while a container will hold a spell for a specific length of time before releasing it.
* Sustain or suppress a spell cast by another with level less than or equal to half the (level + 5 magnitudes) of the Vim spell. This guideline may be used to target the spell itself or the caster of the spells.
* Sustain or suppress a spell or spells of a specific type cast by another with level less than the level + 2 magnitudes of the Vim spell. Examples of specific types include Hermetic Terram magic and Shamanic spirit control magic. This guideline may be used to target the spell itself or the caster of the spells.

Level 5:

Control any disembodied spirit associated with one of the four supernatural realms. (A different spell is needed for each realm.)

Level 10: • Move raw vis from one physical object to another, without needing

a laboratory.

Level 15: • Summon any disembodied spirit associated with one of the four supernatural realms. (A different spell is needed for each realm.)

other Aegis, even if it is a new Aegis being cast, by the same group of magi on the same boundary, to replace their covenant's old Aegis.

No foreign supernatural creature with Might, of any type, can cross the boundary of the Aegis unless its Might exceeds the level of the Aegis. The Aegis of the Hearth must Penetrate the creature's Magic Resistance in order to have this effect. A foreign supernatural creature that is within the Aegis when it is created is not expelled, although it does suffer the limits to its powers described later. If the creature were to leave the Aegis, it would need to have a higher Might than the Aegis, or resist the Aegis, in order to enter again. A spirit with Might that is capable of possessing another creature may enter the Aegis inside that creature, as long as it remains entirely passive. It is aware of what is going on, but cannot act in any way, including to end the possession. If the vessel becomes a native of the Aegis, the possessing spirit also does. The spirit can, however, have its invitation revoked (see later) separately from that of its vessel, if the person revoking the invitation knows that the spirit is there.

Any foreign supernatural effect that originates from outside the Aegis and would affect anything inside the Aegis must Penetrate a Magic Resistance equal to the level of the Aegis of the Hearth to take effect. If it fails to Penetrate, the effect fails completely and harmlessly. This applies to all effects, including Intellego effects that would not normally be blocked by Magic Resistance, and effects that would move something across the boundary of the Aegis.

This also applies to an existing foreign supernatural effect that tries to cross the boundary. If the effect cannot Penetrate the Aegis, it is dispelled. However, if the spell is cast on someone with Magic Resistance, for example an invisibility spell on a magus, then the Aegis must Penetrate the magus's Magic Resistance in order to dispel the effect. This includes such effects as the Parma Magica, Hermetic Longevity Rituals, Familiar Bonds, and Talisman

Bonds. However, the last three of these are automatically sustained by the underlying magic, and so immediately come back into effect once the magus has entered the Aegis. Parma Magica must be raised again, in the normal way.

Any foreign supernatural effect originating within the boundary of the Aegis must subtract half the level of the Aegis from any Casting Total or equivalent. If the effect does not have a Casting Total, as for an effect from an enchanted item, then half the level of the Aegis is subtracted from its Penetration. If the effect has neither a Casting Total nor a Penetration, like the Parma Magica, it is not hindered by the Aegis once it is inside. The supernatural powers of creatures with Might that have been able to enter the Aegis are affected in the same way as any other foreign supernatural effect; this effect does not need to Penetrate Magic Resistance, unlike the exclusion effect.

Anyone who participated in the ritual to cast the Aegis is a native of that Aegis. Entirely mundane people can participate in the Aegis ritual. At most covenants, only the magi participate in the ritual, to avoid the risk of making disguised demons into natives of the Aegis, but this is a custom rather than a feature of the ritual.

Participants who have The Gift and have been opened to the Hermetic Arts are referred to here as &quot;participating magi&quot;, although they may, for example, be apprentices. Participating magi, and only participating magi, can invite other individuals into the Aegis. This involves giving the individual a token that was designated as part of the ritual. Individuals that are invited in this way become natives of the Aegis. Any participating magus can also revoke an invitation, whether issued by themselves or by someone else. They do not need to retrieve the token in order to do this. Invitations and revocations can only be issued to specific individuals — it is not possible to revoke &quot;all invitations&quot;, for

example — but the individual does not need to be present. Invitations and revocations are effective even if the participating magus is mistaken about the identity of the individual. A participating magus can attempt to revoke an invitation even if they do not know for sure that a particular individual has been invited into the Aegis. If they were, then the invitation is revoked, but if they were not, this obviously has no effect. A creature with Might whose invitation is withdrawn is affected in the same way as a creature with Might who was within the Aegis when it was created. Individuals who participated in the ritual, including participants who are not participating magi, cannot be cast out of the ritual; they are native until the Aegis expires, or is dispelled.

Enchanted items can also be native to the Aegis. There are three main classes. The first is items that were within the boundary at the time the Aegis was raised. Unlike creatures with Might, non-sentient items become native to the Aegis simply by being present. The second class is items created within the Aegis by someone native to the Aegis. The third is items deliberately and directly activated by a native of the Aegis. Covenfolk who will use enchanted items may, therefore, participate in the Aegis ritual, but many enchanted items do not need Penetration, and thus can be used within the Aegis without any problems. The set of native items, like the set of native people, resets every time the Aegis is recast. Items, however, cannot be invited into the Aegis.

The Aegis is often cast on the Winter Solstice, as the Magic aura may be slightly higher, and this gives it a full year of duration. It is common for the covenant to hold a celebration for all the covenfolk, and a full council meeting for the magi, immediately after the Aegis is cast.

Aegis of the Hearth was created by Notatus, the first Primus of House Bonisagus. It was a Major Breakthrough (see page 277), incorporating Mercurian rituals as well as Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was chosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is more powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo requisite. By 1220, Notatus's discoveries have spread, and any magus in the Order is capable of inventing versions of the Aegis with the above parameters, but different levels or sizes, or both. Inventing a version with different parameters, however, would require at least a Minor Breakthrough, and vears of research.

<span id="circular-ward-against-demons"></span>
==== CIRCULAR WARD AGAINST DEMONS ====

R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle

All creatures with Infernal Might equal to or less than or equal to the level of the spell are unable to enter the circle or harm those within it. If you cast the spell again, the stronger ring dispels the weaker, regardless of the order of casting. Some magi cast this spell before going to sleep at night. At night, from certain angles, the ring may be seen as a silver-hued dome.

(Base spell)

<span id="maintaining-the-demanding-spell"></span>
=== Maintaining the Demanding Spell ===

R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind

You cast this spell on a spell that you have already cast and are maintaining through concentration. The spell that requires concentration is then automatically maintained for the duration of this spell, whether you concentrate or not. You cannot change the effects of the first spell without concentrating on it again. For instance, you can use The Unseen Arm (ReTe 5) to hold an object in the air without concentrating, but to move the object still requires concentration. A Stamina + Concentration stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 must be made in order to cast this spell while keeping the first one going (a lower roll than normal because this is what the spell is designed for). This spell only works on spells of equal or lower level.

(Base effect, +1 Touch, +1 Diam)

<span id="opening-the-intangible-tunnel-r-arc-d-conc-t-ind"></span>
== OPENING THE INTANGIBLE TUNNEL R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind ==

You can open a magical channel from yourself to some target, allowing you to cast any spell with a range greater than Personal on that target. The tunnel does not, of itself, grant any sense impressions of the target — you must cast appropriate spells through it if you wish to see.

Spells cast through the tunnel cannot be of higher level than that of this spell. You must make standard Concentration rolls to maintain concentration on the Opening spell as you cast other spells.

A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through ''The Invisible Eye Revealed'' or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the tunneling spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the tunneling spell.

If the target of the spell has Magic Resistance, you must Penetrate that resistance to open the tunnel. Spells cast through the tunnel must also Penetrate Magic Resistance normally.

(Base effect, +4 Arc, +1 Conc)

<span id="suppressing-the-wizards-handiwork"></span>
== SUPPRESSING THE WIZARD'S HANDIWORK ==

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

Cancels one spell that you have cast, but only as long as you concentrate. When concentration is broken the effects of the spell return. The level of the spell to be suppressed must be less than or equal to the level of this spell. The effects of the spell being suppressed take about one round to fade out, and then another round to return after concentration is broken. The spell to be affected must be active to be suppressed — in particular, it may not be of Momentary duration.

Common uses of this spell include providing access to some place normally blocked by magic (for example, having a MuTe blocking the door to your lab, and then suppressing it to enter), and avoiding traps (such as suppressing a Watching Ward [ReVi Gen] on your rear door). This spell is designed to be held while you do something else, so the magus gets a +3 bonus to all Concentration rolls.

(Base, +1 Touch, +1 Conc)

<span id="watching-ward"></span>
==== WATCHING WARD ====

R: Touch, D: Spec, T: Ind, Ritual

Watching Ward puts another spell on a given target on hold until that spell is triggered by a simple condition, which is determined when this ritual is cast. The target of the Watching Ward must be

present for the entire casting ritual. When the conditions you specify come to pass, the suspended spell takes effect.

Only one Watching Ward can be placed on any one person or object. The level of the Watching Ward must at least equal the level of the spell held in suspension. You can put multiple spells in the Ward, provided that its level at least equals the sum of the levels of the contained spells. If Intellego spells are included in a Watching Ward, they may be used to trigger the other spells. Thus, if you put Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie (InMe 20) into the Watching Ward, you can also put in a spell that is cast when someone lies. An Intellego spell in the Watching Ward has no effect other than to cast other spells when the proper condition is detected. Thus, in the example, one's breath is not frosty when he or she is caught in a lie.

If someone tries to dispel the Watching Ward and fails, the suspended spell is cast. Flambeau and Tytalus magi commonly put highly destructive spells upon their persons, to be cast if they die so they may have vengeance upon their killers. The Ritual nature of this spell supports the potentially indefinite duration.

The ''Watching Ward'' is dispelled when it releases its spell.

A version of this spell with target Room, known as ''Waiting Spell'', is also well known in the Order. It can contain spells up to the level of the Waiting Spell – 10, and is also a Ritual.

(Base effect, +1 Touch, Duration is non-standard)

<span id="level-15-28"></span>
==== LEVEL 15 ====

GATHER THE ESSENCE OF THE BEAST R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

Concentrates the raw vis in a corpse into one part of that corpse, which can then be removed. This spell lets you gather all the raw vis you find without lugging around entire corpses of beasts. Note that the vis in many magical creatures is already concentrated in this manner in some specific organ, though this spell will allow you to relocate that vis if you wish.

<span id="advancement-total-source-quality--bonus-from-virtues---penalty-from-flaws"></span>
== ADVANCEMENT TOTAL: Source Quality + Bonus from Virtues - Penalty from Flaws ==

A character may only gain experience from one source (one book, one teacher, one set of adventures) in one season. In particular, a character may gain experience from exposure in all and only those seasons in which she does not gain experience points from any other form of advancement. The character may undertake other activities which do not result in experience point gain and still gain Exposure experience; this includes inventing spells in a Hermetic laboratory, or making tables for sale.

<span id="calculating-experience-points"></span>
== Calculating Experience Points ==

There are three steps in determining how many experience points a character gains in a season.

The first is determining the Source Quality. This may be set by the troupe (for practice and adventures, as described later), or by the rules, for teaching and books. There are some Virtues and Flaws that affect the Source Quality, such as Good Teacher.

Next, determine the Advancement Total. This may be the same as the Source Quality, but there are Virtues and Flaws that modify the Source Quality, such as Book Learner.

Finally, determine the number of experience points gained. This is normally the same as the Advancement Total, but there are some Virtues and Flaws, such as Affinity, that modify the Advancement Total when calculating the number of experience points gained.

Seasonal advancement always creates one or more Source Qualities, and all the steps described here apply. Other sources of experience points may create an Advancement Total, or simply assign experience points. If a source creates an Advancement Total directly, no Virtues, Flaws, or other factors that modify the Source Quality apply. Similarly, if a source directly grants experience points, nothing modifies the number.

<span id="assigning-seasons"></span>
== Assigning Seasons ==

The assignment of seasons to activities is, in most cases, an abstraction. A normal character must work for two seasons, and gets two seasons 'free'. However, he cannot leave his job for two seasons, as the free time is spread over the year. Thus, he can only undertake study that he could do in and between his job. The two seasons spent working generate Exposure experience, as described later. Characters may have genuinely free seasons, but this is a matter of character background.

Hermetic magi are among the important exceptions. Hermetic laboratory work always takes an entire, actual season, and Hermetic magi have four genuinely free seasons per year, which they may apply to study or other activities as they wish. If a magus does something other than study, he is entitled to Exposure experience, just like anyone else.

<span id="limits"></span>
==== Limits ====

Some study sources, notably teachers and summae, have a level themselves. The student may not gain a score in the Ability or Art higher than the level of the source, and may not gain any experience points towards the next level from that source. This limit is called the Gain Limit.

<span id="exposure"></span>
=== '''Exposure''' ===

A character can learn simply by being exposed to the thing to be studied. This is by far the least effective way to learn.

Exposure Source Quality: Two

These experience points may be split between any two Abilities or Arts which were being used consistently during the season. If you split the experience points, calculate an Advancement Total for each Ability or Art separately based on a Source Quality of one. Exposure includes both doing something yourself (the normal way), or helping someone else to do it, without any feedback. In particular, Hermetic laboratory activities grant Exposure experience both to the lead magus and to any assistants.

<span id="adventure"></span>
=== Adventure ===

A character may gain experience by going on adventures. This takes a whole season, even if the adventure itself does not; the character spends the rest of the season consolidating what she learned under pressure. A character may choose not to take experience from an adventure if the adventure was short enough to allow other study. Note that the Source Quality is for the whole season, no matter how many adventures happen in a season. (Multiple adventures in one season would be a good reason to set a Source Quality of 10, however.) Similarly, an adventure that takes more than one season may serve as a source of experience in each of those seasons.

ADVENTURE SOURCE QUALITY: 5–10

The Source Quality of an adventure is set by the storyguide, depending on how important the adventure was and how many opportunities for learning there were. Adventure experience may be added to any Abilities or Arts involved in the

actually used as part of the adventure qualifies, as do Abilities used 'off stage', for example during travel. Experience points can only be applied to Arts which were used 'on stage', however.

You may apply a maximum of five points of adventure Source Quality to a single Ability or Art. Calculate an Advancement Total separately for each Ability or Art, based on the assigned Source Quality.

<span id="practice"></span>
== Practice ==

A character can try to deliberately find out more about a subject, by her own efforts. This is more effective than exposure, but it is a full-time activity.

<blockquote>Practice Source Quality: 4-8, usually 4
</blockquote>
In almost all cases, the Source Quality for practice is four.

There are four cases which merit higher qualities.

* First, practicing a language in a community where it is the native tongue merits a Source Quality of eight, until your score in the language reaches 5. At this point, the Source Quality drops to four.
** Second, practicing Area Lore by traveling around or living in the area merits a Source Quality of five to seven, depending on how thoroughly the character can explore the area. A character living in a city while working in a trade could claim one of his nominal free seasons as a Source Quality five practice in Area Lore for the city, while a character with a genuinely free season in the city, or working as a messenger, could claim a Source Quality of seven.
** Third, being forced to practice a trade or craft in an environment with immediate feedback as to how well you are doing has a Source Quality of five. An example would be someone forced to help on a ship.
* Finally, practicing a spell for mastery by casting it repeatedly is worth a Source Quality of five. This can even be done for Rituals or destructive spells, without spending vis or devastating the area, as the magus can abort the spell before fully casting it and still get the practice.

Otherwise the Source Quality is always four.

Experience points from practice may be split between several Abilities. If the Source Quality would be different for the different Abilities, the total number of experience points gained is based on the lowest of the Source Qualities.

Hermetic Arts cannot be increased by simple practice; see Vis Study on page 378 for the equivalent.

<span id="training"></span>
== Training ==

Training is one-on-one training where the master shows the trainee what to do. A character must have a minimum score of two in an Ability before she can serve as a master, and at that level simply yelling at the apprentice when he does something wrong is equally helpful.

TRAINING SOURCE QUALITY: Master's score in Ability being taught + 3

TRAINING GAIN LIMIT: Master's score in Ability being taught

The master must have a higher score than the apprentice. However, the master may work at earning a living while training an apprentice. The apprentice may only be taught an Ability which the master is using to earn a living over the whole season. The apprentice may not earn a living or produce anything useful. Master and apprentice do not need a common language in most cases.

The master gains Exposure experience in the Ability being trained, just as for the normal use of an Ability to earn a living. However, the master only gains experience from Exposure in the seasons spent training the apprentice.

Hermetic Arts cannot be increased by training.

<span id="corship"></span>
== Corship ==

Worship is a seasonal activity (conducted during a free season) and is available to any Christian character with access to a chapel or church. This is different from the normal worship of God performed by virtually everyone in Mythic Europe (attending Mass, religious festivals, etc). This special sort of worship involves a demanding daily routine that includes fasting, prayer, and meditation.

Worship has a Source Quality equal to the Divine aura in the church.

Experience Points from worship may normally be spent on Church Lore, Concentration, Music, or any Supernatural Ability or Art aligned to the Divine that the character already has a Score in. Note that most Supernatural Abilities and the Hermetic Arts are not Divine aligned. The points may be split between several Abilities or Arts; generate separate Advancement Totals for each, based on the assigned worship Source Quality.

Similar activities are available to followers of other Divine faiths, but the details vary depending on the faith.

<span id="teaching"></span>
== Teaching ==

Characters can be taught by other characters.

Teaching Source Quality: Teacher's Communication + Teaching

* 3 + bonus

Teaching Gain Limit: The teacher's score in the Art or Ability

A character must have a score of at least two in an Ability, or at least five in an Art, before she can teach anyone. The teacher and the students must share a common language. The teacher must have a higher score in the Ability or Art than the student.

A character may teach several students. The maximum number of students is equal to the teacher's Teaching Ability times five, or one student if the teacher has a score of zero in Teaching. If a teacher has a single student, whether for an Art or an Ability, the Source Quality gets a +6 bonus. If she has two students, the bonus is +3. If there are more students, there is no bonus.

A teacher may gain exposure to Teaching or the language of instruction, but cannot do anything else in a season when she is teaching.

Hermetic Arts can be taught, but only one-onone. The normal +6 bonus for having only a single student applies.

<span id="books"></span>
=== Books ===

Characters can learn by studying from books, and practicing if the subject of study requires it. It is not possible to study from a book unless you are fluent (have a score of four or higher) in the language in which it is written, and can read and write the writing system used (which requires a score in Artes Liberales).

There are two types of books, summae (singular summa) and tractatus (singular also tractatus). A summa contains an organized account of a topic, taking it from the basics up to a certain level. It can be studied as long as the student's level in the subject of the book is less than the level of the book. A tractatus contains an in-depth treatment of one aspect of the subject. A tractatus is useful to students at any level of ability, because you can never know everything about your subject.

Summae: Source Quality and Level Summa Gain Limit: Summa Level Tractatus: Source Quality

See Writing Books, page 379, for the rules for calculating the Source Quality for a book. However, in most cases the quality, and level for a summa, will simply be noted as features of the book.

Books can be written about any Hermetic Art or any Ability, including Supernatural Abilities and Spell Mastery Abilities. A character can only study a Supernatural Ability from a book if he already has a score of at least one in that Ability.

Reading Summae: A student may continue to study a summa as long as his score in the Art or Ability that it concerns is lower than the level of the text. Thus, a summa may be studied for several seasons with profit.

Studying Tractatus: It takes one season to study a tractatus, and a given student may only study a given tractatus once, with benefit. A person gains nothing from studying a tractatus they wrote themselves.

<span id="vis-2"></span>
=== Vis ===

Magi can study the Hermetic Arts from raw vis. This requires one pawn of vis of the appropriate Art for every five levels or part thereof that the magus has in that Art, and a minimum of one pawn, all of which are consumed during the season's study.

VIS SOURCE QUALITY: Stress Die + Aura Bonus

If the stress die double botches, the maga may enter Wizard's Twilight (see page 228). The number of botch dice equals the number of pawns of vis used in study.

Studying from raw vis does not require a Hermetic laboratory; it can, in principle, be done anywhere. Most magi do study raw vis in their laboratory, though.

<span id="distractions"></span>
==== Distractions ====

Sometimes characters are distracted from study by outside events, like a dragon attacking the covenant. In most cases, a distraction has no game impact, unless the distraction is an adventure and the character chooses to take Adventure experience.

Long distractions, of more than a month, reduce Advancement or writing totals. For every full month lost, reduce the total by one third of its original amount. Round any fractions up.

ooks are of great importance to the Order of Hermes, as they are almost always the best and fastest way for a magus to increase his power and improve

his knowledge.

<span id="standard-texts"></span>
== Standard Texts ==

For nine of the Arts, there is a basic text that, over time, has come to be accepted as the preferred primer for a magus seeking the competence necessary to train an apprentice. These texts, called the Roots of the Arts, are widely and cheaply available. A Redcap can arrange the delivery of any of these texts, for a very small consideration. These texts vary, but all have a Level of at least 7, and a Quality of at least 21. Each troupe should decide which Arts have Roots based on the needs of their saga.

In eight of the Arts, there are summae that are widely accepted as the finest works yet produced. These works, called the Branches of the Arts, can be purchased by young covenants from those with established libraries, but this is unusual. In the ritual of the Order it is accepted that these, purest, expressions of the Art should be given as gifts, because the information they contain is of such great value that they cannot be met in kind. It is, however, a delicate matter for a younger covenant to convince an older one to patronize them with such a valuable gift and, surreptitiously, they often offer payments and services in exchange for the gift of one of the summae.

Many magi seek to pen a standard text, but fail to produce a work that gains this highest level of acclaim. Many libraries contain these informative, but non-definitive, works. Some are excellent but lack the historical romance that has made foundational texts definitive in the minds of magi. Two Roots of the Arts have been superseded, each time by a magus of renown and intelligence. The Branches of the Arts have changed over time, as Hermetic magic gradually increases its reach. For example, the Branch of Terram in 1220 is De Lapii, by Jeremias filius Guernicus, a Summa on Terram, Level 17, Quality 14. Some of these titles hold such awe, however, that the works that replace them retain their titles and nominal authors.

There are no standard tractatus, but dedicated students of various subjects consider certain texts worthy of particular note. These books are far rarer than the Roots and Branches, but can be accessed in libraries that specialize in the book's theme.

Certain magi consider the root and branch symbolism employed in the advertising of standard texts to be a vestigial druidical practice, and they refer to the Foundations and Pillars of the Arts.

<span id="uriting-books"></span>
== '''Uriting''' Books ==

A character must have a score of at least five in an Art, or at least two in an Ability, before she can write a useful book. She must also have a score of at least five in the language she wants to write the book in.

Books may be written about any Ability, including the Mastery Ability of an individual spell. Learning from books about practical Abilities requires the reader to practice as well as read.

Summa Source Quality: Author's Communication + 6 + bonus Summa Gain Limit: Level of summa Tractatus Source Quality:

Author's Communication + 6

<span id="summae"></span>
=== Summae ===

Each summa is described by two factors: its Level, which represents how much knowledge is contained in it, and its Quality, representing how well it is written.

When a summa is started, the Level of the finished book is determined. The Level may be chosen freely by the author, up to half of her score in the appropriate Art or Ability. The quality of the summa is equal to the author's Communication + 6.

If the author chooses to set the Level of the summa below half her score, there is a bonus to the Quality. For an Art, the bonus is one point for every Level by which the summa is dropped. For an Ability, the bonus is three points for every

Level. This bonus cannot exceed the base Quality of the summa, so the final Quality cannot be more than twice the sum of the author's Communication + bonuses from Virtues + 6.

Once the level is determined, writing commences. For every season spent writing, the character accumulates a number of points equal to his Communication + Language. When the total of points equals or exceeds the Level of the summa, for Arts, or five times the Level of the summa, for Abilities, the summa is complete. The Level of the book may not be changed midway through the writing (if the character improves the Art or Ability, for example). Once begun, the book must be finished at the initial Level or not finished at all.

For example, Quintus, who has a score of 24 in Ignem, a Communication of -1 and a Language of 5, wants to write an Ignem summa. He decides that the Level of the summa will be 12, the maximum that he can select. During the first season of writing he accumulates 4 points (bis Communication + Language). He accumulates another 4 in the second season, taking him to 8, and 4 more in the third, for a total of 12. This equals the Level, so the book is completed at the end of the third season. The Quality of the summa is 5. If he had chosen to write a summa at Level 6. it would have taken him 2 seasons, and the Quality of the summa would have been 10, because the bonus from dropping the Level by six points is capped at 5 by the base Quality of the book.

<span id="tractatus"></span>
=== Tractatus ===

It takes one season to write a tractatus. The Quality of a tractatus is equal to the author's Communication + 6.

A character may only write a total number of tractatus equal to half her score in an Ability or one fifth of her score in an Art, rounded up in both cases.

<span id="copying-books"></span>
=== Copying Books ===

A character may copy books carefully or quickly. Copying a tractatus carefully takes one season. Every season that a character spends copying a summa carefully, she accumulates points equal to 6 + her Profession: Scribe score. When she has accumulated points equal to the level of an Art summa, or five times the level of an Ability summa, it has been copied. A careful copy has the same quality as the original book.

A character may copy books quickly at three times the rate. That is, she may make three copies of a tractatus (or one copy of each of three tractatus, and so on) in a season, or she gains 18 + 3 times her Profession: Scribe score points towards copying a summa. Books copied quickly have a quality one lower than the book copied.

COPYING CAREFULLY:

1 tractatus per season, or 6 + Profession (Scribe) points towards a summa.

COPYING QUICKLY:

Three times as fast as careful copying, copy Source Quality is 1 lower than copied book.

<span id="corrupted-copies"></span>
=== Corrupted Copies ===

Books copied by people lacking particular skills become corrupted. In the simplest case, the scribe omits small marks that are a vital part of the meaning because he thinks they are merely ink blots. In more

<span id="definition-of-categories-of-value"></span>
== Definition of Categories of Value ==

It is, theoretically, possible for a peerlessly capable Hermetic teacher, writing in the best of circumstances, to create a summa with a Quality score of approximately (41 – Level). In the history of the Order, this has never happened, but it might during your saga.

A very few summae, those most prized in the Order, are those that have been created by exceptionally powerful magi, with excellent Reputations, later in life. These books can have a Quality of (35 – level), particularly when techniques described in ''Covenants'' are used to enhance a particular copy.

Most of the summae traded within the Order are written by specialists in an Art, with no particular skill in teaching. These summae have a Quality somewhere between (31 – Level) and (28 – Level).

A few books are written by magi with weaker skills than these authors. These books are called &quot;vain summae&quot;, because immodest people do not understand why their book, poor and weak as it is, should not sit alongside better work. These Summae have a Quality of (25 – Level) or below.

Discarded summae are usually damaged versions of the books above. They are stripped of their resonant materials before sale and usually have a Quality of between (18 – Level) and (15 – Level).

A tractatus written by a legendary teacher could, theoretically, have a Quality of around 17, but generally an excellent tractatus will have a Quality of around 14, a sound tractatus approximately 11, and a vain tractatus around 6. Damaged tractatus may have Quality scores as low as 1.

complex cases, he 'corrects' parts of the text, creating gibberish. A corrupted text is useless.

A character must be able to read and write the language in which the book is written to copy it without corrupting it. However, a score of 3 in the language is sufficient to allow accurate copying.

A character must have a score of at least 1 in the relevant Realm Lore, or the appropriate Ability, to copy a text about a Supernatural Ability without corrupting it.

A character must have a score of at least 1 in Magic Theory in order to copy a book about the Hermetic Arts or Parma Magica without corrupting it. Scores in the Ability in question are no substitute in this case.

<span id="acquisition"></span>
== Acquisition ==

The Order of Hermes supports a vibrant book trade with two main branches: sale of finished books, and scribal hospitality. Sale of books occurs through the Redcap system, supplemented by exchanges that occur at Tribunal meetings. The use of magic to support the Redcap network is considered more fully in Houses of Hermes: True Lineages, page 101. Scribal hospitality occurs when a magus is allowed to copy from the library of a covenant to which he does not belong. Hospitality is usually offered in exchange for a payment or service.

<span id="the-sale-of-hermetic-books"></span>
== The Sale of Hermetic Books ==

Many Hermetic books are sold through exchanges of letters, carried by Redcaps. Some Redcaps provide ancillary services to the book trade. Some assess goods for sale on behalf of distant clients, or act as neutral parties between a pair of interested vendors. A few act as procurers, finding desired materials for a small fee. House Mercere's covenants also sometimes act as scribal centers. There are four main methods of postal sale.

Sale by public offer occurs when covenants make known the catalog of books they have available, and invite buyers. Public offers often persist over lengthy periods. Some covenants, for example, provide their sodales with a list at each Tribunal meeting. Some public offers specify the price the seller requires, others invite negotiation.

Sale by tender occurs when a covenant circulates the desire to possess a certain work, or books of a particular type, and invites contact by potential suppliers. These offers are usually accompanied by an indication of the price the covenant would consider fair, but it is not unusual for a potential seller to contact the tendering covenant and suggest an alternative method of payment. Negotiation for sales by tender can be complex and protracted. It is common for several covenants to answer each call, and the tendering covenant may hold a glacial auction by mail, pressuring the sellers to reduce their price. Covenants who do not wish to advertise their requirements can usually hire a Redcap to discreetly ask nearby covenants if they have a suitable book available.

Sale by exchange occurs when a covenant advertises that it wishes to trade one class of text for a second class of text. This sort of barter can lead to extended negotiations, on delivery dates and confirmation of the quality of the copies to be traded by a third party trusted by both vendors. Even the choice of quality assessor is often a matter of haggling.

Sale by subscription occurs when a magus announces his intention to create a spell or device and invites magi to pay, in advance, for access to a Lab Text when it becomes available. Some magi seeking subscriptions offer a flat price: for

<span id="prices-for-books"></span>
== Prices for Books ==

Many Hermetic books are sold under a condition called the Cow and Calf Oath. This refers to a ruling from the Hibernia Tribunal that has not been ratified by the Grand Tribunal. It is an agreement that the purchaser of the book will not sell, or freely give, copies without the seller's permission. Some magi approve of the Cow and Calf Oath, while others despise it. The prices given later, aside from that for mundane books assume the characters have sworn the Oath. Prices may be far higher for books that will rival their parents, and reduce the income of the original covenant.

<span id="mundane-books"></span>
=== Mundane Books ===

The mundane book market is a cash market. Any magus with a spare pound can obtain any standard text from a stationer in a large city. Less common books still cost a pound, but it takes a season for the stationer to arrange for a copy to be produced and delivered. Cheaper versions, unbound and written on paper, are also available, for half a pound. Commissioning books takes longer for covenants remarkably distant from civilization, or poorly served by the Redcaps.

<span id="books-concerning-the-arts-and-arcane-abilities"></span>
== Books Concerning the Arts and Arcane Abilities ==

The Hermetic book trade is essentially a barter market. Most covenants can create so much mortal money that it isn't valuable enough for them to use as a medium of exchange for rare items. This makes pricing books an art, subject to a lot of haggling. The value of the book for sale, and of the things that might be traded for it, can be disturbed by events. A second magus might offer a similar book at any time, lowering the first book's value. A covenant might decide it has too much vis for one Art, and seek to trade it for others. This lowers the value of all vis of that Art, which would make a book's seller ask for more.

<span id="least-expensive-books"></span>
== Least Expensive Books ==

The cheapest books available are damaged and discarded surplus books from major libraries. Inexpensive Hermetic books are not systematically produced for sale. Any established covenant could theoretically make them, but no established covenant needs them. There are few buyers for cheap books, and no covenant wastes the effort of creating a book on something that might not sell for years. Characters wanting damaged and discarded books can often arrange for them to be added to other trades as sweeteners. A covenant wanting to purchase damaged summae with vis can usually find a seller for about a pawn of vis per book, but could arrange other services instead. It is unusual for a seller to have a pile of damaged tractatus to sell for a pawn of vis, but after a library flood or some similar calamity, a buyer might get somewhere between three and nine to the pawn, depending on the degree of damage.

<span id="vain-books"></span>
=== Vain Books ===

Books of the second-lowest level of Quality exist because their authors chose to publish them, despite their comparative lack of worth. Such authors are usually proud of their books, and some give them as gifts to their friends and allies. Characters can usually purchase vain summae for half their level in pawns of vis, less if the author is particularly susceptible to flattery. Vain tractatus cost about a pawn each.

Characters attempting to acquire a vanity book from someone other than its author often find that they must pay for it as if it were sound. The amount of labor and material involved in copying a book does not change simply because the buyer insists on a poor title, and the time taken to copy the poor book could instead be used to copy a good one for another buyer.

<span id="sound-books"></span>
== Sound Books ==

Books of the level of Quality that make up most Hermetic libraries are

the most difficult to price. There are many possible sellers, so buyers have some opportunity to compare prices and force competition. Generally, the lowest prices can be found at covenants that have staff permanently copying books. These charge a number of pawns of vis equal to the book's level, if the purchaser is willing to wait a season for the copy to be produced. A surcharge of up to 20% is added if there is a spare copy available for the impatient. Sound tractatus cost around 2 pawns to order, or 3 for the impatient, but trade of equivalent, sound tractatus remains very common.

<span id="excellent-books"></span>
=== Excellent Books ===

Most books of the highest Quality cannot be purchased. Covenants receive them as gifts in exchange for exceptional service, and on the condition that the book will never be copied without the permission of the originating covenant, or magus. The Cow and Calf Oath limits the distribution of some material, but is difficult to enforce.

House Bonisagus does allow magi to copy books of exceptional Quality, as part of its members' obligation under the Oath of Hermes. Durenmar does not sell copies of these texts, but does limit copying to one magus at a time, selected by the Primus's representative. Durenmar uses a version of the Cow and Calf Oath to insist that copies of these finest works not be sold, because it is an insult to the authors of the book to value their work against mundane possessions. They may only be given, and with ceremony. There is little the Bonisagus magi can do to prevent the gift being a reciprocation, beyond social pressure.

House Tremere is eager to sell, or buy, copies of excellent books. A difficulty is that Coeris is an extraordinarily rich covenant, so simple offers of vis do not interest the Prima. In the past, she has accepted transfer of ownership over valuable vis sources in exchange for books. House Tremere takes the Cow and Calf Oath very seriously and sometimes champions it at the request of others.

example, a pawn of vis per subscriber. Other magi, performing more difficult and expensive research, sometimes encourage the formation of purchasing consortia by offering proportional payments. For example, a magus might agree to release his new Ritual in exchange for twenty-five pawns of vis. Covenants spread across Europe may form a buying cartel, splitting the costs in various ways. These consortia are maintained by side agreements. For example a vis rich covenant may pay a large proportion of the price, in exchange for a series of political concessions, acts of assistance with vexing problems, and payments in kind. This allows poor, Spring covenants to join purchasing consortia.

Books are often sold at Tribunal. Many of these sales are pre-arranged, by the methods that are described earlier, and completed at the Tribunal meeting, when each party has the opportunity to inspect the goods of their correspondent. Other covenants bring surplus copies to sell to whoever desires to buy. Many covenants, not wanting the possible expense of unsold stock, create exemplars and take orders during Tribunal for later delivery. These books are prepared to a series of informal standards, with the finer books, intended to be used for study, commanding higher prices than those intended as originals, from which working copies are to be made.

<span id="learning-supernatural-abilities"></span>
= Learning Supernatural Abilities =

nly characters with The Gift (see page 63) can learn Supernatural Abilities associated with the Magic realm using these rules, but

the teacher need not have The Gift (although, obviously, he must have the Supernatural Ability). Other realms have different conditions, described in the appropriate Realms of Power sourcebook.

Supernatural abilities can only be taught if they have an associated Ability, in game terms. Thus, Shapeshifter can be taught, but Unaging cannot. The initial teaching in a supernatural ability must be by Training or Teaching, as described earlier. Once the character knows the Ability, it may be advanced normally.

In order to learn a supernatural ability, the student must reach a score of at least 1 in the first season. That is, he must gain at least 5 experience points. However, he must subtract the total of his scores in other supernatural abilities from the Source Quality.

Supernatural Ability Source Quality: Normal Source Quality

* Total Score in Supernatural Abilities

If the student has had the Hermetic Arts opened (see page 206), he must subtract 15 or the sum of all his Art scores, whichever is higher, from the Source Quality.

For example, a character has Shapeshifter 3, Dowsing 4, and The Gift. He wants to learn Animal Ken. He must find a character who is willing to teach it to him, despite his Gift, and who can manage a Source Quality of at least 12. If the character has also been opened to the Hermetic Arts, but still has scores of 0 in all of them, he needs to find a teacher who can manage a Source Quality of 27 (15 for the Arts, +3 for Enchanting Music, +4 for Dowsing, +5 for the number of experience points he needs to gain). This is effectively impossible.

Mystery Cults can often avoid the penalty due to prior mystical abilities through their Initiation rituals.

<span id="training-oreatures"></span>
== Training Oreatures ==

ith the approval of the storyguide, any magical beast with an animal intellect — that is, those that have a Cunning (Cun) characteristic

— may be tamed, and then used by another character as a mount, guardian, or companion as appropriate. Taming an animal is a possible laboratory activity for a magus, but mundane animal handlers and some magical characters can also attempt to tame animals. Once an animal has been tamed, it can be further trained and taught a number of tricks.

<span id="taming-animals"></span>
== Taming Animals ==

Regardless of whether the character taming an animal is a magus, a magical character, or a mundane trainer, taming is a seasonal activity and the character accumulates a number of points each season towards taming the animal. The taming is complete when the accumulated total of points exceeds the Might of the creature. Points only accumulate between consecutive seasons, so if the character does something else in the interim then any points already gained are lost. Points for taming animals cannot be transferred between trainers.

<span id="required-points-to-tame-a-creature-might-of-the-creature-minimum-1"></span>
== REQUIRED POINTS TO TAME A CREATURE: Might of the Creature, minimum 1 ==

In all cases, the tamer must be able to interact daily with the creature throughout the season. If the creature has a violent temperament, the tamer may require some kind of protection (magical or otherwise).

If the tamer can generate enough points to tame a creature in a single season, he may split his point total between the taming of several creatures of the same species, but he cannot tame a number of additional creatures in excess of his Animal Handling Ability Score.

<span id="a-hermetic-tamer"></span>
== A hermetic Tamer ==

For a magus, taming an animal is a laboratory activity, and the creature must be housed in the laboratory. Of course, if the creature is very large this may necessitate the construction of a new laboratory. The number of points that the magus accumulates each season is based on the magus' Rego (Form) Lab Total (including bonuses, see insert), which is calculated using the Hermetic Form

<span id="taming-mundanc-beasts"></span>
== Taming Mundanc Beasts ==

Mundane beasts can also be tamed, and (for this purpose only) mundane beasts have an effective (Animal) Might of 1 + 2 x Confidence Score. Note that taming a beast is a social activity, so penalties for The Gift apply to the number of points accumulated in a season; creatures with Magic Might are often not affected by The Gift in this way.

<span id="-1"></span>
== **** ==

appropriate to the creature — Aquam for a kelpie, Ignem for a fire elemental, and so on.

Taming Points Accumulated Each Season: Re(Fo) Lab Total – Creature's Might

For example, to tame a fire elemental with an Ignem Might 25, the magus must accumulate 25 points. If the magus has a Rego Ignem Lab Total of 40 he will accumulate (40-25=) 15 points each season, and therefore take two complete seasons to tame the elemental.

During the process of taming an animal, a Hermetic magus produces a Lab Text that has a level equal to the Might of the creature that was tamed. A magus may use such a Lab Text, written by himself or another, to provide a bonus to his Lab Total when training animals of the same Form (see Hermetic Bonuses insert). In addition, a magus may spend a season replicating the instructions in such a Lab Text to tame another creature of exactly the same species, whose Might does not exceed the level of the Lab Text. To use the Lab Text in this way, the magus must have a Re(Fo) Lab Total at least equal to the level of the Lab Text. Of course, to use any Lab Text the magus must be able to read it; normally a Lab Text prepared by another character needs to be translated.

<span id="hermetic-bonuses-to-taming-lab-total"></span>
== hermetic Bonuses to Taming Lab Total ==

The following bonuses apply to the Rego (Form) Taming Lab Total for a Hermetic magus:

* Animal Handling Ability Score
* Animal Ken Ability Score
* Experimentation Bonus (i.e. a magus can use the Experimentation rules when taming an animal).
* +1 for every 5 levels of the highest level similar Lab Text the magus can consult as a guide. A similar Lab Text is an animal taming Lab Text that uses the same Hermetic Form.

<span id="a-magical-trainer"></span>
== A Magical Trainer ==

A character with the Minor Supernatural Virtue Master of (Form) Creatures may tame creatures of that Form that have Cunning statistics. For each consecutive season spent, the character accumulates a number of points equal to:

Taming Points Accumulated Each Season by a Master of Creatures:

Trainer's Might + Trainer's Animal Handling + Trainer's Animal Ken – Creature's Might

If the trainer does not have a Might Score, his Magic Lore Ability Score is substituted for his Might in this calculation (a character with Might can also choose to substitute her Magic Lore Ability Score). If the beast is connected to the same Form as the trainer, the trainer's Might Score is doubled for the calculation above.

<span id="a-mundane-trainer"></span>
== A Mundane Trainer ==

A mundane trainer can also attempt to tame a beast. He generates a number of points each consecutive season, equal to:

Taming Points Accumulated Each Season

BY A MUNDANE TRAINER:

Int + Animal Handling

* Animal Ken – Creature's Might

Generally, a mundane trainer will only be able to successfully tame beasts with a small Magic Might.

<span id="tricks-stunts-and-tasks"></span>
== Tricks, Stunts, and Tasks ==

Once an animal is tamed it may be commanded by characters with Intelligence (Int) characteristics. The animal can be commanded by any such character with the Animal Handling Ability or by a character to whom the animal is loyal (see below). Regardless of the method used to the tame the animal, once tamed he does not count as being under a continuing mystical effect.

<span id="loyalty"></span>
== Loyalty ==

Once a creature is tamed he acquires the Personality Trait (Loyal +0), directed towards the character who tamed him. If the creature already has a Loyal Personality Trait, then he does not gain a new Trait, rather the old Trait is focused towards the trainer and its level does not change. Sometimes commanding an animal calls for a Loyalty Test, and as this is a &quot;social interaction,&quot; penalties for the Gift do apply.

LOYALTY TEST: Loyal Personality Trait

* stress die vs Ease Factor

If he wishes, any character with the Animal Handling Ability may spend additional seasons with an already-tamed creature to improve or transfer the loyalty of that creature. Each additional season of training increases the Loyal trait by +1, to a maximum of +3. A character can only improve the loyalty of an animal that is loyal to himself, but instead of increasing the Loyal trait, with this season of extra training the trainer can choose to transfer the animal's loyalty to another character (who must also be present for the season). The trainer may even transfer the loyalty of the animal to himself if he was not the character who originally tamed the animal. A magus who has the Lab Text for a tamed animal (see earlier) may also transfer or improve the Loyal trait of the animal by spending a season, as long as his Re(Fo) Lab Total is at least equal to level of the Lab Text.

<span id="training-abilities"></span>
== Training Abilities ==

Any character with the Animal Handling Ability may train and therefore improve a tamed animal's Abilities using the standard training rules. As normal, the master must have a greater score in the Ability than the animal does.

Usually, an animal may only be trained in Abilities that he already has a score in, as other Abilities are beyond his capacity. But the troupe may relax this restriction on a case-by-case basis; for example, to allow a horse to be taught to swim. At the end of any season spent training for an Ability that the animal does not already have a score in, make a Loyalty test for the animal against an Ease Factor of 6. If this Loyalty test fails, then the animal does not gain any training experience and the season is wasted. Loyalty tests are not required to improve existing Abilities.

<span id="trained-groups"></span>
== Trained Groups ==

A character may lead tamed animals in combat, as a trained group. The character must have either tamed each animal himself or spent at least a season working with each animal. The character's Animal Handling Ability score is used instead of his Leadership Ability score to determine how many animals he can lead at one time (see the Obstacles chapter, page 396). Note that while the animals must all have Combat Scores that each fall within a 5-point range, the character leading them does not need to match the Combat Scores of the animals in this way (this is an exception to the normal rules). However, if the character's scores are outside the range, he does not count as part of the group when determining their combat totals. Depending upon the temperament of the animals involved, fighting as a group may require Loyalty tests against an Ease Factor of 6.

<span id="commanding-a-creature"></span>
== Commanding a Creature ==

In general, when the character commands a tamed creature make a Presence + Animal Handling roll against an Ease Factor set from the following table. The Ride Ability may be substituted for Animal Handling when the character is using the animal as a mount, and for exotic creatures another Ability might be more appropriate; the Magic Lore Ability might be used for commanding tamed elementals, for example. A botch may cause the animal to flee, mistakenly perform some other command, or attack its master — depending on the nature of both the command and the beast.

If several characters issue an animal with contradictory commands, it will preferentially obey commands issued by a character it is loyal to. Otherwise, it will obey the command of the character with the highest Presence + Animal Handling Total. For example, a magus tames a magical wolf (the wolf is now loyal to the magus) and he then commands the wolf to guard his sanctum door, the wolf will not normally obey contradictory commands to leave his post.

| The creature fears some portion of the task. Note that it is the animal's perception of fear that is important here. Most animals would fear a battle, or fire, for example. If the creature does not have a Confidence Score, a Loyalty test against an Ease Factor of 6 must also be made to follow through on this task.
|-
| 15
| The task is clearly suicidal, or at least extremely dangerous; a Loyalty test against an Ease Factor of 9 must also be made for the creature. Again, it is the animal's perception of whether a task is suicidal that is important. Some tasks that are suicidal — for example, eating poisoned food — will only concern the animal if he can actually identify the risk; that is, he perceives that the food is poisonous.
|}

<span id="animal-ken-1"></span>
=== Animal Ken ===

A character with Animal Ken (page 159) can speak to animals, including some magical beasts. Such a character can attempt to reason with any animal (regardless of whether it is tamed or not) using his Animal Handling Ability, and so convince it to perform a task. This does not result in a tamed animal, merely an animal that has decided to obey a particular instruction. If an animal is tamed, the character may issue morecomplex commands to it. The animal is no more likely to obey these commands, but it may allow the character to better utilize an animal as a scout or informant. Another important use of Animal Ken is to convince an animal that is balking at performing some dangerous task that the task is not dangerous after all.

<span id="changing-reputations"></span>
== Changing Reputations ==

character gains a Reputation, with a score of 1, by doing something noteworthy in front of witnesses who will talk. A grog might fight a dragon and

survive, or kill a demon with two blows of his dagger. A priest might preach a heretical sermon to a monastery. A magus might give the covenant's vis sources away at Tribunal. All of these generate a Reputation. Once a character has a Reputation, anything he does that draws attention to himself strengthens that Reputation, as long as it is not in direct contradiction. Treat the Reputation as an Ability, and give the character one 'experience point' in it for every noteworthy action he performs. Thus, performing ten noteworthy actions raises a Reputation from one to two.

A character may wish to get rid of a bad Reputation. This is not easy. First, he must do something spectacular enough to start a Reputation, and gain a score of 1 in the new Reputation. Then he may count noteworthy actions that specifically support the new Reputation towards increasing it, rather than the bad Reputation. General noteworthy actions still

increase the original Reputation. Once the new Reputation exceeds the old, general actions grant experience to the new Reputation instead. At this point, the character may choose to reduce the old Reputation by one point instead of raising the new Reputation when he gains enough experience points to raise it.

If a character has two Reputations, the storyguide should roll both to see whether a random person has heard of the character. A person may have heard both Reputations, in which case he may not know what to believe, or may amalgamate them. For simplicity's sake, most characters should have no more than two Reputations.

<span id="mystery-initiation"></span>
== Mystery Initiation ==

he process of Initiation into a Mystery is given a full treatment in ''The Mysteries Revised Edition'', but a summary of the mechanics is provided here.

All of the Exoteric (that is, House) Mysteries are governed by a separate (House) Lore; thus there is a House Bjornaer Lore, a House Criamon Lore, a House Merinita Lore and a House Verditius Lore. Initiates who have not been apprenticed to a member of the House need at least (House) Lore 1; the Mystagogue for any Initiate must also know the same Lore, but generally needs a high level if the Initiation is to succeed. To grant the Initiate a new mystery Virtue, the Mystagogue generates an Initiation Total, which determines the success or failure of the Initiation:

Initiation Total: Presence + (House) Lore + Script bonus

Note that the Initiation Total is based on the scores of the Mystagogue. There is no die roll; if the total is higher than the required target level the Initiation succeeds. Initiation Scripts and their bonuses are described below, and examples are given in the Hermetic Magic chapter. The target for this total is the Initiation Target Level, which depends on the kind of Virtue to be initiated, Major or Minor:

To Initiate a Minor Virtue known by the Mystagogue, the target level is 15

To Initiate a Major Virtue known by the Mystagogue, the target level is 21

The Target Level is increased in the unlikely event that the Mystagogue does not know the Initiated Virtue. This is most often the case in the event of a maga who decides to try to Initiate herself in a Mystery Virtue without a Mystagogue,

in which case the Initiate acts as her own Mystagogue and uses her own scores in the Initiation Total.

<blockquote>To Initiate a new Minor Virtue, the target level is 18
</blockquote>
To Initiate a new Major Virtue, the target level is 30

In addition, if the Initiate underwent a previous Ordeal (gained a Flaw, lost a Virtue, or increased a Flaw from Minor to Major) for a previous Initiation), reduce the Target Level as follows:

FIRST INITIATION AFTER AN ORDEAL: subtract 3 for a Minor Ordeal, 6 for a Medium Ordeal, 9 for a Major Ordeal

Second Initiation After an Ordeal: subtract 2 for a Minor Ordeal, 4 for a Medium Ordeal, 6 for a Major Ordeal

Third Initiation After an Ordeal: subtract 1 for a Minor Ordeal, 2 for a Medium Ordeal, 3 for a Major Ordeal

Only one past Ordeal counts towards a new Initiation, and there is a minimum Target Level of 9 no matter how great a reduction is applied.

If the Initiation Total equals or exceeds the Target Level, then the Initiation succeeds automatically. No die roll is made — it is required merely to be properly prepared, and skilled enough to succeed.

If the Mystagogue's Initiation Total does not exceed the Target Level, the Mystagogue may be able to vary and extend the Script, to make it more effective. If that is still not enough (for example, no Script exists) then the Mystagogue can experiment to attempt to discover a Script.

<span id="the-initiation-script"></span>
== The Initiation Script ==

This is a written text (similar to a Lab Text) which describes a successful Initiation and the process followed: the chants and methods, the places and times, and any sacrifices made. If this Script is followed exactly, the Script grants its bonus to the Initiation Total. Scripts usually detail the price of Initiation, which may take the form of an Initiation Ordeal (the acquisition of a Major or Minor Flaw, loss of a Major or Minor Virtue, or increasing a Minor Flaw to Major level), an Initiation Quest (a lengthy journey combined with a series of challenges), and/or an Initiation Sacrifice (of time, wealth, knowledge or power). The Scripts detailed in the Hermetic Magic chapter give the bonus contributed to the Initiation Total from each component of the Initiation Script involved. More details about Initiation Scripts can be found in The Mysteries Revised Edition, Chapter 2: Entering the Mysteries. That chapter includes details of the hazardous process of creating a new Script.

== Varying a Script ==

It may be necessary for a Mystagogue to modify an Initiation Script; for example, to add additional elements to it to make a difficult Initiation possible for an inexperienced Mystagogue.

To vary the Script, the Mystagogue makes a test of:

Stress Die + Intelligence + (House) Lore vs. Ease Factor

The Ease Factor is 9 to extend the Script by adding a new component, such as an additional Quest. A magus with lower Presence or (House) Lore will often try to extend a Script he has acquired.

The Ease Factor is 12 to make a change to a component, such as varying the place, the time, or the subject of a Quest. It is not possible to change which Virtue the Script Initiates; that requires a new Script.

The Mystagogue may only attempt one change in a given Initiation. If the test fails, the Initiation would fail (and the Mystagogue will

If a single change is not enough to make this Script work, then either a different Script is needed, or the Mystagogue must study more Cult Lore, or experiment.

<span id="carping-2"></span>
== '''Carping''' ==

arping is the side effect of living in a strong supernatural aura, or being subject to supernatural effects over a long period of time. Every

character has a Warping Score, which is increased like an Ability, but by Warping Points rather than experience points. To increase the Warping Score by one point, a character needs five times the new score extra Warping Points. Thus, to increase from a Warping Score of 2 to one of 3, a character must gain 15 Warping Points.

Warping Points can be gained from exposure to any of the supernatural realms, Divine, Faerie, Infernal, or Magic. The points are not distinguished based on their source.

<span id="warping-and-non-humans"></span>
== Warping and Non-humans ==

Other mundane creatures and things are also warped by mystical effects. However, keeping track of the Warping Scores of every table in the covenant is unlikely to be fun. Instead, the storyguide should just describe interesting effects, as required. The rules for humans give an idea as to when the effects should be visible, and as to how serious they should be.

Creatures with a Might score are absolutely immune to warping. They are already fully part of one of the supernatural realms.

<span id="-3"></span>
== *** ==

<span id="gaining-qarping-points"></span>
== Gaining ''Qarping Points'' ==

There are four main sources of Warping Points:

<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Living in a strong (6 or higher) supernatural aura.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Being affected by a powerful supernatural effect, unless you created the effect, or it was designed especially for you.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Being continuously under the influence of a supernatural effect, whether powerful or not.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Botching a roll to use a supernatural ability.</li></ol></li></ul>

Note that these are separate sources of Warping Points. Thus, if a magus designs a powerful supernatural effect, such as a Longevity Ritual, for himself, he doesn't gain Warping Points for being under a powerful supernatural effect, but he does gain them from being under a continuous supernatural effect.

All sources of Warping Points stack. A character continuously affected by a strong supernatural effect that wasn't designed for him and that he didn't cast gains Warping Points both from being affected by a strong supernatural effect, and for being continuously under the influence of a supernatural effect.

<span id="living-in-strong-auras"></span>
== Living in Strong Auras ==

Auras of over five points have an effect on anyone living within them, reflected in gaining Warping Points. The number of points gained depends on the strength of the aura and the length of time spent there.

A character is 'always within' an aura if she lives, works, and sleeps there. Occasional visits outside the aura do not matter. 'Half time within' applies to someone who sleeps in the aura but works elsewhere, or vice-versa. It also covers someone who spends two weeks constantly in an aura, and two weeks outside. 'Frequent visits' means that the character spends about a quarter of her time in the aura.

This time refers to the total length of time spent in an aura, even if there are several different auras involved. Time spent in higher auras may be treated as time in a lower aura if this increases the number of Warping Points gained. For example, a character who spends half her time in a level 6 aura, with frequent visits to level 7 and 8 auras, should gain one Warping Point per year, because she is always in an aura of at least level 6.

Characters with supernatural abilities arising from the same realm as the aura (for example, Hermetic magi in a Magical aura) do not gain Warping Points from living in the aura. They may gain them from other sources.

<span id="powerful-supernatural-effects"></span>
=== Powerful Supernatural Effects ===

Anyone subjected to a powerful supernatural effect gains a Warping Point, unless they themselves were responsible for the effect or it was specifically and carefully designed to work on them. 'Powerful effect' is subjective, but any Hermetic spell of sixth magnitude or higher counts. Designing an effect for a particular target requires, in Hermetic terms, that a special version of a Formulaic spell be invented. The spell has its effect on anyone, but only the designated target, and the caster, do not suffer Warping unless the effect is also continuous. Hermetic Longevity

Rituals are always designed for a specific target. If the effect is continuous, a Warping Point is gained when it begins and every season thereafter. Ritual effects with Momentary duration are not continuous, but do grant a Warping Point when first applied if they are neither cast by the target nor specifically designed for the target.

<span id="constant-supernatural-offects"></span>
=== Constant Supernatural Offects ===

A character who is constantly under the influence of one or more active supernatural effects gains one Warping Point per year for each effect. The strength of the effect is irrelevant, as is the caster, and whether or not the effect was designed specifically for a certain person.

A character is only under the influence of an effect if she is affected directly and personally. Thus, a character enchanted to fly at all times is under the influence of an effect, but a character living in a flying castle need not be, the castle is directly affected by the magic.

Wards are active mystical effects as long as they are protecting someone. Two notable exceptions are Parma Magica and the Aegis of the Hearth, which are based on the same breakthrough by Bonisagus.

Effects with Momentary duration are not continuing effects. A Hermetic Longevity Ritual is, and thus grants one Warping Point per year as a continuing supernatural effect even though it does not grant any Warping Points as a powerful supernatural effect.

The binding between a Hermetic magus and his familiar or Talisman does not grant Warping Points, nor do any powers enchanted into the bond.

An effect which is active for half the time counts as constant for these purposes. Less than that, and it does not. Further, it also counts if the character is under the influence of some supernatural effect or other for half the time, even if the particular supernatural effect changes. A character under the effect of a different Sun Duration spell from sunrise to sunset every day for a year would gain a Warping Point.

A powerful, continuous effect that is not specifically designed for an individual grants one Warping Point when first applied, and five every year thereafter: one because it is a continuous supernatural effect and one per season (four total) because it is a continuous powerful supernatural effect.

<span id="supernatural-botches"></span>
== Supernatural Botches ==

When a character botches the roll to invoke a supernatural effect (for example, a Hermetic spell or a Supernatural Ability), she gains one Warping Point for every zero on the botch dice.

<span id="effects-of-warping"></span>
== Effects of Warping ==

The effects of warping depend on a character's Warping Score, the nature of the character, and the source of the warping.

Hermetic magi are made more prone to Wizard's Twilight by their Warping Score. This replaces the normal effects.

Mundane characters gain a Minor Flaw when they reach a Warping Score of one. Note that most inhabitants of Mythic Europe have no Warping Points at all, because they live in a low aura and have never been the subject of a supernatural effect. Even those who have been affected by a powerful supernatural effect once only have one Warping Point, not enough for a Minor Flaw.

This Minor Flaw should reflect the predominant source of the Warping Points. If they are mainly due to an aura, the Minor Flaw will reflect the aura, and most characters will get the same Minor Flaw. If they are mainly due to magical effects, they will reflect the effect. For example, a character who has been repeatedly healed with powerful magic might gain a stigmatic wound, which neither hurts nor causes damage, but looks and feels real.

When the Warping Score reaches 3, the character gains a second Minor Flaw.

At a Warping Score of 5, the character gains a supernatural Minor Virtue attuned to the primary source of Warping Points. This stops any further gain of points from living in a strong aura of the same type as the Minor Virtue.

At a Warping Score of 6, and every point thereafter, the character gains a Major Flaw appropriate to the main sources of the warping.

<span id="aging"></span>
== Aging ==

Characters begin aging in the Winter after they turn 35. Every year, a character must roll on the aging table.

AGING TOTAL:

Stress die (no botch) + age/10 (round up)

* Living Conditions modifier
* Longevity Ritual modifier

As a high roll generally indicates more serious effects of age, a high Longevity Ritual modifier and a high Living Conditions modifier both indicate longer life.

A Longevity Ritual is effective until the character suffers a crisis. When the crisis occurs, the ritual assures that the character survives, but its power is spent, and the focal ritual must be performed again (see page 261).

A character under the influence of a Longevity Ritual should roll on the table no matter what his age, but treats all rolls of 10 or more as rolls of 9 until he reaches the age of 35. His apparent age may be younger than his actual age, but he is at no risk of actually aging before any other characters. At the player's and storyguide's discretion, this may also apply to characters with modifiers to the aging roll from other sources.

Apparent age increases: Particularly low rolls on the table mean that the character appears no older. Otherwise, the character's apparent age increases by one year. The modifier to rolls depends on the character's actual, not apparent, age.

Aging points: Aging points are accumulated in each Characteristic. Once a character has a number of Aging Points greater than the absolute value of the Characteristic, the Characteristic drops by one point and all Aging Points are lost.

Thus, a character with a Communication of +2 drops to +1 in the year when he gains his third Aging Point in that Characteristic. A character with a Stamina of -3 drops to -4 in the year when he gains his fourth Aging Point in that Characteristic.

If an Aging Point 'in any Characteristic' is gained, the player may choose the Characteristic.

Decrepitude: Every Aging Point also counts as an experience point towards Decrepitude, which increases as an Ability. Thus, a character who has gained seventeen Aging Points has a Decrepitude score of 2. Characters with a Decrepitude score of 4 are extremely frail, and must roll on the Crisis Table if they undertake stressful activities, such as long journeys, or any combat. Characters with a Decrepitude score of 5 are bedridden and will die within a few months at most. They cannot be saved by mortal intervention.

Crisis: Increase the character's Decrepitude first, and then roll on the Crisis Table.

Medical attention may help someone through a crisis. An Int + Medicine roll against an Ease Factor of 6 allows the character to add the attendant's Medicine score to the roll to survive the crisis. Only one doctor may usefully attend a patient, and if the doctor botches the character must subtract 3 from the survival roll.

Virtues that affect aging rolls do not affect crisis survival rolls.

Creo Corpus magic can postpone a crisis, or resolve it if cast as a Momentary Ritual. The level of spell required depends on the severity of the crisis, as noted on the table. Note that the magic required to resolve a crisis that is major or worse is powerful enough to cause warping.

A character who survives a crisis, even through magic, needs the rest of the season to recover fully, and thus cannot undertake any other activities.

<span id="xi-obstacles"></span>
== XI. Obstacles ==

he characters have goals that they want to achieve, but Mythic Europe does not always cooperate.

This chapter covers the rules for some of the most important ways that other parts of the world might get in the characters' way.

<span id="combat"></span>
== Combat ==

ombat is generally not the most important part of '''Ars Magica''' stories, but when it occurs it is both dramatic and deadly.

<span id="combat-scores"></span>
== Combat Scores ==

Characters have five combat scores: Initiative, Attack, Defense, Damage, and Soak. If a character is just using one weapon, the weapon modifiers can simply be read off the weapon table (page 400-401). If the character is using a weapon and a shield, add together the modifiers of the weapon and the shield to get the final modifier.

INITIATIVE TOTAL:

Quickness + Weapon Initiative Modifier

* Encumbrance + Stress Die

ATTACK TOTAL:

Dexterity + Combat Ability + Weapon Attack Modifier + Stress Die

DEFENSE TOTAL:

Quickness + Combat Ability + Weapon Defense Modifier + Stress Die

<span id="combat-botches"></span>
== Combat Botches ==

A botch on a combat roll reduces the total to zero, just as for any other botch. If a character botches his Defense roll, he is almost certain to be killed if his opponent is armed and at all skilled. His opponent will have a large Attack Advantage (equal to his Attack Total), which will translate into serious damage, most likely fatal. This is what should be expected, if you make a serious error while someone competent is trying to kill you, you will die. This makes Ars Magica combat potentially extremely deadly, so characters should think very carefully before wading into it.

If a combatant has a negative base Defense Total (someone with negative Quickness and no combat Abilities, for example), then a botch does not increase the Defense Total to zero; rather, it adds zero to the total, leaving it at its full negative value.

DAMAGE TOTAL: Strength + Weapon Damage Modifier

* Attack Advantage

SOAK TOTAL: Stamina + Armor Protection (+ Form Bonus, for magi)

In addition, the Attack Advantage, calculated during combat, is central to resolution.

Attack Advantage: Attacker's Attack Total

– Defender's Defense Total

<span id="combat-sequence"></span>
== Combat Sequence ==

Initiative is determined once for the whole combat, and then remains the same every round.

Each party to the combat acts in order of decreasing initiative, so the party with the highest initiative acts first. A party with a high initiative may delay its action to respond to a later action in the round. If two or more parties tie, they should re-roll to determine which goes first.

On its action, the attacker rolls a stress die, and uses the result to calculate the Attack Total. The defender also rolls a stress die, and uses the result to calculate a Defense Total. If the Attack Total exceeds the Defense Total, the attack has hit. The Attack Advantage is the amount by which your Attack Total exceeds your opponent's Defense Total.

If you hit, subtract the opponent's Soak Total from your Damage Total. The opponent suffers wounds depending on the amount by which your Damage Total exceeds his Soak Total, and the opponent's Size.

If you miss, you cannot do any damage, no matter how high your Damage Total.

Repeat until all parties to the combat have had the chance to act.

A single combat round, consisting of one attack from every party to the combat, takes about six seconds.

<span id="length-of-a-combat-round"></span>
== Length of a Combat Round ==

A combat round lasts for about six seconds, so that a Diameter Duration spell lasts for twenty rounds.

<span id="spell-damage-1"></span>
== Spell Damage ==

Spells list their damage as &quot;+X&quot;. This means roll a stress die and add X to calculate the Damage Total. The target's Soak Total + Stress Die is then subtracted from this to determine the wounds suffered. When a spell is aimed, an Attack Advantage is calculated, but it does not affect the damage dealt.

Each further +1 size adds +1 to each wound range. For every 5 + size points by which the Damage Total exceeds the Soak Total, the wound level increases by one.

On the first initiative roll A gets a total of 10, B gets 6, C, D, and E all get 4, and F gets 2. On the reroll, C gets 12, D gets 4, and E gets 1. The final order of actions is A B C D E F. The reroll only determines the relative ordering of C, D, and E; it does not over-ride the initial initiative result.

<span id="combat-simple-example"></span>
== Combat: Simple Example ==

Ignatio finds himself fighting Polandrus, the Infernal wolf from the Bestiary chapter. Ignatio is on foot, fighting with a shortsword and round shield. Polandrus fighting with his teeth. Their combat statistics are as follows:

Ignatio: Init: +1, Atk: +12, Def: +11,

Dam: +7, Soak: +11

Polandrus: Init: +18, Atk: +11, Def: +9,

Dam: +8, Soak: +6

They start by rolling for Initiative. Ignatio rolls a 2, for an Initiative Total of 3. Polandrus rolls a 6, for an Initiative Total of 24. Polandrus attacks first, to no-one's surprise.

The wolf rolls a 5 for his attack, for an Attack Total of 16. Ignatio rolls a 6 for his defense, for a Defense Total of 17. He fends the wolf off with his shield, and is unharmed.

Then Ignatio attacks, and rolls a 0. He now has to check for a botch (see page 227). The storyguide decides that the standard one botch die should be rolled, as there are no special circumstances calling for more botch dice. Fortunately for Ignatio, he rolls a 4 and doesn't botch. His Attack Total is thus 12, since the zero he rolled on his stress die just counts as a zero. The wolf rolls defense, and also gets a 0. He also rolls one botch die and gets a 1, so Polandrus also managed to avoid botching. The wolf's Defense Total is only 9, so Ignatio has an Attack Advantage of 3. This means that he does his base 7 plus his Attack Advantage of 3 = 10 points of damage. Polandrus has a Soak of +6, so 4 points get through. Since Polandrus's Size is -1, looking up the damage vs. Polandrus's Size on the Damage Table (page 404) results in a Light Wound. Polandrus now gains a -1 Wound Penalty to all actions.

In the next round, Polandrus attacks again. He rolls a 6, which, with the Wound Penalty, only yields an Attack Total of 16. Ignatio rolls a 7, for a Defense Total of 18. Safe, again.

On his attack, Ignatio rolls a 6, for an Attack Total of 18, while the wolf only manages a 2 (including penalty), for a Defense Total of 10. This gives Ignatio an Attack Advantage of 8, which after accounting for Ignatio's Damage and Polandrus's Soak works out to 9 points of damage (note that Polandrus's Wound Penalty does not apply to Soak because Soak is not an action). This inflicts a Heavy Wound on Polandrus, adding another –5 to his Wound Penalty. The wolf is now at –6 to all actions.

At this point, Polandrus realizes that he will lose this battle unless he gets very lucky. As a demon, he can escape simply by reverting to spirit form, and he does so. Ignatio is the winner.

<span id="missile-combat"></span>
=== Missile Combat ===

If only one side in a combat has missile weapons, the other side can do no damage at range.

The Attack Total suffers a -3 penalty for every range increment beyond the first between the attackers and the defenders. The range increment depends on the weapon.

If you are defending against missile weapons, only a shield's Defense Bonus adds to your Defense Total. Other weapons are no good against missiles. Your Combat Ability still adds, as this represents your ability to dodge as well as to defend using weapons.

<span id="moving-in-combat"></span>
== Moving in Combat ==

To simplify things for the game, there are three speeds with which characters can move while in combat.

A walk is rarely used in combat. More often, characters walk when they are not expecting danger.

A hurry is the usual pace on the battlefield, equivalent to jogging or marching at double cadence.

A run is very fast, but tiring. The character may be required to make a Fatigue roll.

WALK:

10 + Qik – Encumbrance paces per round Hurry:

2 x (10 + Qik – Encumbrance) paces per round

4 x (10 + Qik – Encumbrance) paces per round

<span id="length-of-a-pace"></span>
== Length of a Pace ==

LENGTH OF A PACE: 3 feet

<span id="groups"></span>
== Groups ==

Combat in Ars Magica is usually between groups rather than individuals, and there is no guarantee that a single player is controlling a single character. Thus, combatants may be divided into groups. Groups are handled together for combat purposes, and may consist of one to six characters, inclusive. Some troupes may not want to use the group combat rules, either because they hardly ever have combats against multiple enemies, or because they prefer to play with exactly one character per player at all times.

All members of a group must be of roughly comparable ability. This means that all Combat Totals must fall in a five-point range. That is, for each Combat Total, the best member of the group can be no more than five points better than the worst. This

requirement only applies when the group is formed, wounds and other penalties taken during combat do not force the group to split unless the leader or vanguard (see below) is incapacitated.

In general, player character groups will consist of grogs fighting together. Martial companions will almost invariably be fighting independently.

A group has a vanguard, the character who bears the brunt of the fighting. Trained groups also have a leader, who may or may not be the same person. The leader and vanguard may only be changed while the group is not in combat, but for these purposes a single round in which the members of the group neither attack nor are attacked is long enough. This is also long enough to merge a number of individuals into a group, or split a group.

If the vanguard or leader is killed or otherwise incapacitated, the group splits into individuals. They may reform into a new group in a single round, as long as they stay out of combat.

<span id="group-damage"></span>
== Group Damage ==

When a group inflicts damage, it inflicts the damage calculated in the combat sequence a number of times equal to the number of combatants in the group, effectively, each member of the group hits once. The blows should be spread as evenly as possible among the members of the opposing group. The vanguard must always take at least as many blows as every other member of the group.

For example, a group with four members strikes a group with three members, one of whom is Giant Blooded, although the vanguard and the other fighter are normal sized humans. After subtracting the defending group's Soak (which is equal to the vanguard's Soak), the attack does 6 points of damage. Thus, four six point wounds are inflicted. Because four blows cannot be split evenly between three characters, the vanguard must take two blows. For a normal human, a six point wound is Medium, so the vanguard takes two Medium Wounds while the other normal human takes one. For a Giant Blooded character, six points is only a Light Wound, so that character takes a Light Wound.

Wound penalties from wounds taken by the vanguard are applied to the group's statistics, but other members continue to give their full bonus until they are incapacitated.

<span id="untrained-group"></span>
== Untrained Group ==

A number of characters on the same side, of approximately equal ability (as defined above). Designate one character as the vanguard. Combat statistics are as for the vanguard.

<span id="trained-group"></span>
== Trained Group ==

A group of characters who have trained to fight together. A group can be considered to have trained to fight together if they have spent at least one season improving combat skills at the same time and in the same place (for example, last summer at the player characters' covenant).

A trained group has both a leader and a vanguard. These may be the same person, but need not be. The leader organizes the group, while the vanguard bears the brunt of the fighting.

The maximum number of fighters that can be coordinated is equal to the leader's Leadership score. If the group is larger, it is treated as an untrained group, as above, because the leader cannot co-ordinate it. As noted earlier, a group cannot have more than six members, even if the leader has a very high Leadership score.

The group's combat statistics are equal to the vanguard's statistics.

The other members of the group generate a bonus. The bonus is equal to the sum of the combat abilities of the other members of the group, but limited by three times the group leader's Leadership score. Thus, if the group leader has a Leadership score of 3, the bonus cannot exceed 9. This bonus can exceed 18 if the leader has a Leadership score of 7 or higher. This bonus can be applied to either Attack or Defense, but only to one of the two. The group can switch its application from round to round.

<span id="defender"></span>
=== Defender ===

One or more characters are defended by one or more other characters. Treat the defenders as a group of the appropriate kind. The defended character is only injured if the defenders botch or are incapacitated. The most common instance of this is a magus defended by one or two grogs, known as his shield grogs. The character being defended is not a part of the defending group, and thus does not need to be roughly comparable in ability. The defending group may undertake any normal combat actions.

The number of characters defended may not exceed the number of characters defending.

<span id="combat-options"></span>
== Combat Options ==

Most combat options are equally available to groups and individuals.

<span id="disengaging"></span>
=== Disengaging ===

A party that wants to disengage from combat generates a Defense Total instead of an Attack Total when it is their turn to act. All opponents who have attacked that party in the last round generate an Attack Total as well. If the disengaging Defense Total beats all the Attack Totals, the party has left the combat, and cannot be attacked unless another party also disengages and chases them.

Note that a party that has not been attacked since its last turn may disengage automatically.

A party that tries to disengage repeatedly gets a +3 cumulative bonus for every attempt after the first: +3 on the second attempt, +6 on the third, and so on. If the party attacks before it disengages, the bonus resets to zero.

<span id="exertion"></span>
=== Exertion ===

By expending a Fatigue level you can add a bonus equal to your Combat Ability to either attack or defense for one round. This bonus applies to a single attack roll, but to all defense rolls you make before your turn comes round again. In a group, all members of the group must expend a Fatigue level, and the bonus is equal to the vanguard's Combat Ability.

<span id="magic-1"></span>
== Magic ==

Magi may wish to use magic in combat. They may cast spells at their place in the initiative order, but since spells have no initiative modifier this is based on their Quickness alone. A magus Fast Casting a spell (see page 217) acts in immediate response to another action, and thus not at a particular initiative point.

It takes approximately one combat round to cast a spell, unless it is fast-cast. Thus, a magus cannot cast more than one normal spell in a single round, but may also cast a fast-cast spell, or cast only fast-cast spells. A very fast magus may be able to cast more than one fast-cast spell, but this is beyond most magi.

<span id="mounted-combat"></span>
== Mounted Combat ==

A mounted character adds his Ride score, to a maximum of +3, to his Attack and Defense Totals, due to higher position and control of a large animal.

<span id="non-lethal-combat"></span>
== Non-Lethal Combat ==

There are two basic types of non-lethal combat: grappling and scuffling. In a grapple, one character tries to immobilize the other, while in a scuffle one tries to knock the other out. The rules for both types of combat are closely based on the normal rules, differing only in the way the consequences are worked out.

In a scuffle, the effects of a successful attack are changed, causing the opponent to lose Fatigue levels, and take much less serious wounds. Work out what level of wound the defender would take in a normal combat, using the rules above, and read the scuffle result off the Scuffle Effects table.

Fatigue levels inflicted in a scuffle are Short-Term Fatigue levels.

A character may scuffle with no penalty when unarmed or armed with a sap. If using a real weapon, he takes a –3 penalty to his Attack Total, reflecting the need for care to avoid killing his opponent by mistake, and does not add the weapon's Damage Bonus to his Damage Total.

A character attempting to grapple another succeeds if his Attack Advantage is greater than zero. Record the Attack Advantage, as the Grapple Strength. The grappled character may make a normal attack against the grappler to attempt to escape, but may not make any other attacks or take other actions that involve moving around. If the grappled character's attack succeeds, subtract his Attack Advantage from the Grapple Strength. If this reduces the Grapple Strength to zero or less, the grappled character has escaped from the grapple, inflicting a Light Wound on the grappler.

A grappling character may make another attack in later rounds to strengthen his grip. Add the Attack Advantage from each attack to the Grapple Strength. Similarly, the grappled character may make repeated attempts to escape.

Note that the Grapple Strength is only changed by successful attacks, in which the Attack Advantage is greater than zero.

A character must use the Brawl Ability to grapple, and must have free hands. Any melee Combat Ability, including Brawl, may be used to break free from a grapple.

<span id="special-offects"></span>
== Special Offects ==

Sometimes characters want to do something that is within combat, but not an attack. This would include tripping an opponent, disarming him, or grabbing the amulet round his neck. Follow the normal combat sequence, and set an Attack Advantage needed to succeed. If the 'attacker' achieves that Attack Advantage, the maneuver succeeds.

Most maneuver attacks are based on Brawl, because the attacker is not using a weapon.

<span id="splitting-groups"></span>
== Splitting Groups ==

If two or more groups are attacking a single defending group with more than one member, the attackers may attempt to split the defending group. This is resolved as a normal attack, but if the Attack Advantage is zero or higher the attacking group splits a group off the defenders, rather than inflicting damage. The statistics for the defending groups should be recalculated as appropriate. Under these circumstances, groups may assign new leaders and vanguards in combat.

As a general rule, the group should be divided evenly when split. If two groups are attacking one, and one attacker succeeds in splitting them, the defending group should be split in half. If three groups are attacking and two or three attackers succeed in splitting the defending group, the group should be split in thirds. If, say, five groups are attacking, but only one group succeeds in splitting the defenders, the defending group should be split in half.

Groups may only try to split their opponents' groups in melee combat.

== Combat: Complex Example ==

Paul, Gerard, and Ignatio are on a patrol that takes them into a faerie forest. The faeries, deciding to have some fun, create exact duplicates of them, and send them into battle. The three grogs must now fight themselves.

Their combat statistics are as follows:

Gerard: Init +0, Atk +10, Def +9, Dam +10, Soak +6 (Single Weapon 6, Leadership 2)

Ignatio: Init: +1, Atk: +12, Def: +11, Dam: +7, Soak: +11 (Single Weapon 6, Leadership 2)

Paul: Init +2, Atk +8, Def +6, Dam +7, Soak +9 (Single Weapon 5, Leadership 3)

They qualify to form a group, and the real grogs have trained together in the covenant. The faeries haven't, though, so they can only form an untrained group. The grogs quickly adopt their fighting formation. Ignatio is the vanguard, so they use his combat statistics, and Paul is the leader. The relevant Combat Abilities add to 11, so they have the full +9 bonus allowed by Paul's Leadership. They decide to put it on Attack in the first round.

The faeries form an untrained group. Ignatio is still the vanguard.

The grogs roll a zero for Initiative, but don't botch, for a total of 1. They're probably going to go last. The faeries also roll a zero, so it's a tie. On a re-roll, the grogs get an 8 and the faeries get a 4, so the grogs go first.

The grogs roll a 4 for attack. With the group bonus, this gives them an Attack Total of 25. The faeries get really lucky, and roll a 12 for defense, for a Defense Total of 23. The grogs still hit, but only for 9 damage, which doesn't get through the faerie vanguard's Soak.

The faeries roll a 2 for attack, for an Attack Total of 14, and the grogs also roll a 2, for a Defense Total of 13. An Attack Advantage of 1, however, is not enough to get through the grogs' Soak, so no damage is done.

On their next attack, the grogs roll another 2, for an Attack Total of 23 (they are still putting the bonus into attack). The faeries also

roll a 2, and the troupe call for new dice. Anyway, they have a Defense Total of 13. This gives the grogs an Attack Advantage of 10, so 6 points of damage, enough for a Medium Wound on each of the faeries, gets through. The faeries now have –3 to all combat totals.

They roll a 4 on attack, for an Attack Total of 13, including the penalty. The grogs roll a 3, for a Defense Total of 14, holding them off.

The grogs attack again, getting a 5, for an Attack Total of 26. The faeries can only manage a 2 in defense, which now only gives them a Defense Total of 10, because of the Wound Penalty. An Attack Advantage of 16 translates into 12 points of damage getting through, inflicting a Heavy Wound, and a –5 penalty, on the faeries. Their total penalty is –8.

At this point, the faeries decide they want to run away. Thus, they generate a Defense Total instead of an Attack Total. They roll a 1, followed by a 3, for 6 in total. This gives them a Defense Total of 9, because of the penalty from wounds. The grogs roll a 2, for an Attack Total of 23, the faeries aren't getting away that easily.

The grogs attack again, and roll a 3, for an Attack Total of 24. The faeries roll a 9 in Defense, for a total of 12. An Attack Advantage of 12 means 8 points of damage, and another Medium Wound. The faeries now have -11 to all totals.

The faeries try to disengage again, and now get a +3 bonus on the roll. This, unfortunately for them, only offsets the Wound Penalty. They roll a 0, which doesn't help at all, giving them a Defense Total of 3. The grogs don't botch, and the faeries are still trapped in combat.

On their next attack, the grogs roll a 6, for an Attack Total of 27. The faeries roll a 6, but they don't get the disengage bonus on this roll, so this gives them a Defense Total of 6. An Attack Advantage of 21 translates into 17 points of damage, an Incapacitating Wound. The faeries all drop, and the combat is over. The grogs take the opportunity to thank the turb captain for insisting that they train together.

<span id="armor"></span>
== Armor ==

Armor is important — it helps prevent characters from sustaining grievous wounds in battle. Two factors describe the armor a given character wears: what it is made of and how much of it the character is wearing. The Armor Table at the end of this section lists the statistics for each type of armor available in Ars Magica.

<span id="materials"></span>
=== Materials ===

Quilted cloth, a thin layer of leather, or layers of leather-strap-wrapped fur or cloth is the most basic of armor. Using very thick leather, or hardening leather by wax impregnation or baking, makes a better material for deflecting crushing damage. Using further reinforcements to the leather through the application of studs, rings, or other metal pieces strengthens it against slashes and cuts. Breaking the leather up into a flexible array of scales allows the use of thicker pieces of leather. Replacing the leather scales with small overlapping metal plates again increases protection while retaining flexibility, although metal weighs slightly more. At the top of 1220 technology lies chain mail, a suit of flexible metal made of links of chain.

<span id="outfittings"></span>
== Outfittings ==

Partial armor covers the vital areas only, and generally consists of a hauberk (a short-sleeved armored coat that extends down to the knee), perhaps a coif to protect the head and neck, and often an open-faced helmet. Full armor adds gauntlets to protect the hands, vambraces for the forearms, chausses for the legs, a closed helm that protects the face, and perhaps additional pieces for the throat, elbows, and knees. Full armor also often includes a gambeson, a heavily padded surcoat worn over the armor. The small auxiliary pieces may be made of a different material than the main cuirass - for instance, a suit of full chain mail might have chain mail to protect the torso and leather scale on the arms and legs (or it might be entirely made of chain mail). For simplicity, only the predominant material of the suit has any effect on game statistics (Protection and Load).

== Ceapon Descriptions ==

<span id="brawling-ceapons"></span>
== Brawling Ceapons ==

Dodge: Simply getting out of the way of opponents, without trying to do damage.

Fist: This is includes any unarmed attacks made with the hands

Kick: Unarmed attacks made with the feet are more powerful, but less accurate. Characters may kick standing opponents but most often this attack is used against prone enemies.

Gauntlet: This is a heavy glove of hardened leather or chain mail. It does more damage than a bare fist, and is more effective at blocking attacks. Full armor always includes gauntlets and partial armor sometimes does (troupe's option).

'''Bludgeon''': This could be a sap (a leather bag filled with lead shot) or any heavy object like a stone or a small hammer.

Dagger: For the purposes of this table, a dagger is any knife-like weapon of length between about 6 inches and 14 inches. Daggers are commonly carried as tools, as well as for self-defense.

Knife: Any sharp knife of 6 inches or lesser length. Knives are even more common than daggers; they are everyday tools.

<span id="single-weapons"></span>
=== Single Weapons ===

Axe: This could be a common woodcutter's axe or a heavier battle weapon. It is small enough to wield in one hand, albeit sometimes awkwardly.

Club: A club could be simply a heavy stick, or an iron-shod weapon.

'''Hatchet''': Any axe with a haft shorter than about 18 inches. It does less damage than a longer axe

because of poor leverage. Some hatchets are suitable for throwing.

Lance: The lance may only be used from horseback, where it is a Single weapon. If the rider is dismounted, he may wield the lance two-handed as a Long Spear.

Mace: The mace is any heavy, bludgeoning weapon with a weighted head, usually made of iron. The head is usually spiked or flanged. Other weighted, one-handed bludgeoning weapons, like hammers, are treated identically to maces.

Mace and Chain: One or more weighted, spiked or flanged heads connected to a haft by a length of stout chain. Sometimes called a &quot;morning star.&quot;

Spear, Short: A spear short enough to wield in one hand, from 4–7 feet in length. This is a very common battlefield weapon, often used by warriors who cannot afford a sword.

Sword, Short: Any bladed weapon from 14 inches to about 28 inches long. Short swords in the Middle Ages were not uncommon and could be single- or double-edged, usually with a sharp point for thrusting. Large woodsman's knives are big enough to count as short swords.

Sword, Long: Any sword over 28 inches long. These swords are typically used by horsemen because they are long enough to reach opponents on foot. Long swords are typically straight, even in Arabia: the curved sword was introduced later than the 13th century.

'''Shield''', '''Buckler''': A small shield that buckles to the forearm, usually made of metal. It is light enough that other objects can be held in the shield hand.

Shield, Round: A wooden shield that is cheap and easy to make.

Shield, Heater: Often made of a combination of wood and metal, this shield tapers to a point at the bottom. The outer surface is not flat, but convex to better deflect blows.

<span id="great-weapons"></span>
=== Great Weapons ===

Cudgel: A heavy, two-handed club.

Farm Implement: Many farm implements such as rakes, scythes, and mattocks can be used as improvised weapons. They are characterized by awkwardness and a tendency to break under the rigors of combat. As improvised weapons, farm implements are less effective even than other Inexpensive weapons.

Flail: A two-handed, heavier version of the common threshing flail, this weapon is effective and easy to make. Treat a smaller, one-handed flail as a &quot;mace and chain.&quot;

Pole Arm: A number of bladed, long-handled weapons were in use during the Middle Ages, from the continental guisarme to the English &quot;brown bill.&quot; They vary in details but are characterized by a long cutting blade. For simplicity, they all have the same statistics.

Pole Axe: Any axe that is too large to wield one-handed. Length typically varies from four to six feet.

Spear, Long: Any spear too long to use one-handed, from about 8' to 15' or longer.

Sword, Great: A heavy, two-handed sword, designed to penetrate heavy armor

Staff: A common, inexpensive weapon often carried about the countryside for self-defense.

Warhammer: Includes other weighted, bludgeoning weapons such as a two-handed mace.

<span id="missile-ceapons"></span>
=== Missile Ceapons ===

Axe, Throwing: Can be wielded in melee as a hatchet.

'''Javelin''': Can be wielded in melee as a short spear.

Sling: Although the sling uses the Thrown Weapon skill, it has much greater range than a hand-hurled weapon.

Stone: A stone heavy enough to hurt someone, about the size of a fist.

Bow, Long: The famous English longbow, which equally famously required years of training and physical conditioning to use.

Bow, Short: The name makes it sound weak compared to the long bow, but the short bow is still powerful enough to use on the battlefield or to hunt large game.

<span id="encumbrance"></span>
== '''Encumbrance''' ==

haracters who are carrying a great deal of equipment are hindered in many of their actions. This is represented by subtracting the character's Encumbrance score

from the relevant rolls. Most athletic activities are penalized, as is spell casting (see page 213), but, in combat, Attack and Defense are not, as long as the Encumbrance is largely due to weapons and armor.

Encumbrance is calculated in two stages. Heavy or bulky items have a Load value (listed in the Armor and Weapons tables on pages 400 and 401). Add up the total Load that a character is carrying, and use it to calculate the character's Burden. Burden increases when Load reaches the level for that Burden, so that a character with a Load of 9 has a Burden of 3.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

If the character's Strength is zero or negative, his Encumbrance is the same as his Burden. If the character has positive Strength, his Encumbrance is the amount by which his Burden exceeds his Strength. Thus, if a character has a Burden of 2 and a Strength of 0 or less he has an Encumbrance of 2. If a character has a Burden of 2 and a Strength of +1, he has an Encumbrance of 1. A Burden of 2 and a Strength of +3 gives Encumbrance 0; the character does not get bonuses.

<span id="patigue"></span>
== Patigue ==

haracters who exert themselves in combat and other strenuous activities can become tired and even exhausted. This is measured using Fatigue levels. Most

characters have six Fatigue levels, and each is given a name. Listed in order from least fatigued to most fatigued, they are Fresh, Winded, Weary, Tired, Dazed, and Unconscious. Fatigue levels can be lost as Short-Term Fatigue or Long-Term Fatigue, but both kinds come off the same set of levels. Thus, a character who has lost one Short-Term and two Long-Term Fatigue levels is Tired, and takes a -3 penalty to all actions.

Each Fatigue level above Winded has a penalty associated with it (except for Unconscious, which is its own penalty). Fatigued characters must apply the relevant penalty to all rolls, including further Fatigue tests, but not Soak attempts. These penalties represent the effects of growing exhaustion, and are cumulative with those resulting from Wounds (page 404) The penalty for Weary is -1, for Tired -3, and for Dazed -5.

<span id="short-term-fatigue"></span>
== Short-Term Fatigue ==

Characters are normally Fresh until they perform some strenuous action, such as engaging in combat, casting Spontaneous spells, or sprinting. Brief strenuous actions require a Fatigue roll: roll Stamina - Encumbrance on a stress die against an Ease Factor of 6. Failure means the loss of one Short-Term Fatigue level. A botch costs two. Combat and magic use have different rules for Fatigue loss that replace those given here. See pages 213, 231, and 397.

<span id="recovery-from-short-term-fatigue"></span>
== Recovery From Short-Term Fatigue ==

A character recovers from Fatigue one level at a time, starting with the most exhausted level. The table below is a guideline to help you determine how long it will take a character to recover. Recovery from Fatigue requires quiet rest; if the character remains active, recovery time is doubled. At the storyguide's option, fatigued characters may make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 when they are recovering. Success allows recovery in half the normal time.

If characters take Fatigue levels above Unconscious, each additional Fatigue level adds one hour to the time required to recover to Dazed.

<span id="long-term-patigue"></span>
== Long-Term Patigue ==

Long-Term Fatigue levels are lost from extended tiring activities, such as hiking all day under a hot sun, or running to carry a message between cities. The levels are lost automatically, and the number of levels lost is at the storyguide's discretion. These levels are only regained after a good night's rest. One night's rest removes one Long-Term Fatigue level.

If a character has lost both Long- and Short-Term Fatigue levels, the more serious levels are treated as short term. Thus, a character who climbed a wall while being chased by dogs, losing one Short-Term Fatigue level, and then was pursued all afternoon by the same dogs, losing two Long-Term Fatigue levels, would be Tired. After half an hour's rest, he would recover to Weary, but any further improvement requires a night's rest.

<span id="counds"></span>
== Counds ==

hen characters take damage from any source, they suffer wounds. The severity of the wound depends on the amount by which the Damage Total

exceeds the character's Soak Total. (See page 394 for how to calculate these totals in combat, and page 407 for how to calculate them in other situations.)

\*The character may not undertake any actions.

Characters may have any number of any type of wound, in any combination. The character suffers a penalty to all actions (rolls and totals) equal to the sum of all penalties due to his wounds, and the activities he can safely undertake are restricted (see Activities While Injured, below). Note that Soak is not an action, and thus does not take the Wound Penalty.

For example, a grog has taken one Heavy Wound. He has a total Wound Penalty of –5. Another grog has taken two Light Wounds and one Medium Wound. He also has a total Wound Penalty of –5, but his wounds will heal more quickly (see page 405).

Each further +1 size adds +1 to each wound range. For every 5 + size points by which the Damage Total exceeds the Soak Total, the wound level increases by one.

There is no maximum limit to a character's Wound Penalty, and characters cannot die immediately from non–fatal wounds, no matter how many there are. However, less serious wounds can worsen and become Incapacitating, and an Incapacitated character can still die (see below).

<span id="activities-thile-injured"></span>
== Activities Thile Injured ==

Characters are severely limited in what they can safely do while injured. Obviously, Incapacitated characters can do nothing. Less wounded characters are also limited. Any character who does more than his injuries allow must make an immediate Recovery roll for his most serious wound. This roll can result in the wound worsening, but not in a bonus to future rolls or improvement.

Characters who are injured in a combat need not make Recovery rolls for further activities within that combat, but must make the rolls if they take excessive action afterwards.

Wound Penalty –6 or greater: The character can talk, eat, and move himself short distances given time and assistance. Productive activities (including study, Hermetic Lab work, and craft work) are impossible.

Wound Penalty –3 to –5: The character can walk, provided he is allowed to go slowly and take frequent rests. All long-distance travel rates are halved. The character may study, but his Advancement Total is halved if he is at this level of penalty for one month or more of the season. Hermetic Lab work and craft work are impossible.

Wound Penalty –1 or –2: The character can travel and study normally, but cannot undertake strenuous activities, including casting spells that cost Fatigue. Hermetic Lab work and craft work can be undertaken as normal.

<span id="recovering-from-counds"></span>
== Recovering From Counds ==

Players must make Recovery rolls for each wound that a character has. This roll generates a Recovery Total:

Recovery Total:

Stamina + Medic's Chirurgy or Medicine score

* Magical Aid + Stress Die

Recovery rolls are made at intervals determined by the severity of the wound, and there are two Ease Factors. If the Recovery Total equals or exceeds the Improvement Ease Factor, the wound improves by one level, for example from Medium to Light. If it equals or exceeds the Stable Ease Factor, the character remains at the same level of wounds, and gains a +3 bonus to future rolls. These bonuses are cumulative until

the wound improves or gets worse. If the Recovery Total is less than the Stable Ease Factor, the wound becomes one level worse due to infection.

Recovery rolls do not suffer from the Wound Penalty.

{| class="wikitable"

Characters recover from all their wounds at the same time. Thus, a character with three Light and one Medium Wounds would make three Recovery rolls every week until the Light Wounds heal, and one every month until the Medium Wound became a Light Wound, at which point he would start making rolls every week for that wound.

<span id="recovery-from-incapacitation"></span>
== Recovery from Incapacitation ==

For an Incapacitated character, the outlook is grim — death could come at any time. The player must make two Recovery rolls each day (at sunrise and sunset) that the character has an Incapacitating Wound. On a roll of 0 or less, the character dies. A roll of 9+ improves all Incapacitating Wounds to Heavy Wounds, and recovery then proceeds normally. Any other roll means a somewhat worsened condition, and all subsequent Recovery rolls are made at a cumulative —1 penalty until the wounds improve or the character dies. If the character is attended by a chirurgeon or medic, a bonus equal to the relevant Ability applies.

These are standard Recovery rolls, and magic that helps normal Recovery rolls also helps these.

<span id="medical-attention"></span>
== Medical Attention ==

As noted above, a character's recovery may be aided by medical attention. The relevant sort of attention depends on the source of the wounds. Combat wounds and similar injuries require Chirurgy, while diseases and poison require Medicine. Only one Ability can help with a given wound. An attending medic's player does not need to make any die rolls.

More detail on medicine is given in ''Art and Academe'', Chapter 4.

<span id="healing-spells"></span>
== healing Spells ==

Certain Creo Corpus rituals can heal wounds immediately, without requiring a roll (see ''The Chirurgeon's Healing Touch'' on page 332).

Other Creo Corpus spells provide a bonus to the Recovery roll (see ''Purification of the Festering Wound'' on page 332). This bonus adds to any bonus due to medical attention. These spells must be in effect for the whole of the recovery period, either because their duration exceeds the recovery period, or because they are recast. They can cause Warping (see page 389).

<span id="other-perils"></span>
== Other Perils ==

<span id="debilitation"></span>
== Debilitation ==

Characters may suffer from afflictions which drain them over time, such as diseases or poisons. Such afflictions cause wounds, but these wounds are treated with the Medicine Ability, rather than Chirurgy. The rules for recovery are otherwise the same as for injuries inflicted in combat.

Anyone exposed to a debilitating agent, whether poison or a cause of disease, must make a Stamina check against an Ease Factor set by the cause of the disease. If the check succeeds, the character suffers nothing more than minor discomfort. If it fails, the character takes a wound, the severity of which depends on the severity of the agent. This wound then recovers according to the normal rules, including the chance for it to get worse.

<span id="diseases"></span>
=== Diseases ===

Most diseases in Mythic Europe are caused by imbalances in the patient's humors. There are four humors, blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile, and in a healthy person they are in balance. When the humors come out of balance, they cause diseases. The imbalance can happen spontaneously, or be caused by an imbalance in the character's diet. Bad air can also unsettle the humors, and cause a disease to afflict an entire community at once. Diseases are not normally transmitted from one person to another, however.

Some diseases are caused by disease spirits, often minor demons. As these diseases are magical attacks, they are resisted by Magic Resistance, and their details depend on the spirit responsible. Magi are still vulnerable to mundane diseases, however.

Spontaneous diseases are covered by the aging rules (see page 391). Diseases due to an external cause are covered by the debilitation rules (see above).

Since most people do not have access to medical attention, a disease with an Ease Factor of six will afflict about half of the population, and an Ease Factor of twelve means that the disease strikes almost everyone. Potentially fatal diseases inflict Heavy or Incapacitating Wounds. Diseases should not inflict fatal wounds on first being contracted.

Note that a type of disease can have any Ease Factor and Wound type, as they come in varying strengths.

More detailed rules for diseases are provided in ''Art and Academe'', pages 45–51.

<span id="poisons"></span>
=== Poisons ===

Poisons come in many forms, derived from plants, animals, and minerals. The Ease Factor for the initial Stamina check is at least 3, as nothing weaker counts as a poison, and can range as high as 15. Poisons can inflict fatal wounds from the beginning. Poisons are treated as injuries for recovery purposes and the details of Recovery rolls. More information on poisons can also be found in ''Art and Academe'', particularly pages 64–65.

<span id="deprivation"></span>
== Deprivation ==

Characters deprived of food, water, or air suffer quite seriously. Each kind of deprivation has a check time, and the character must make a Stamina check when he has been deprived of that necessity for the specified length of time. The Ease Factor for the check starts at 3, and increases by one for every time period that passes. When the character fails a check, he loses a Fatigue level. When he has lost consciousness due to fatigue, the next failed check results in a Light Wound. This wound gets one step worse for every subsequent failed check. Wounds due to deprivation are treated with Medicine.

Fatigue levels lost due to food or water deprivation are Long-Term Fatigue levels, and can only be regained once the character has eaten or drunk. Fatigue levels lost due to air deprivation are Short-Term.

<span id="injuries"></span>
== Injuries ==

Non-combat sources of injury have a damage bonus, which is added to a stress die to determine the amount of damage done. Typically such a roll would have only one botch die, and a botch would mean no damage done. In most cases, only the bonus is written, so a fire might be described as Bonfire (+10), which means that it does a stress die + 10 damage.

Soak against other sources of injury is calculated by adding a stress die to Soak. In some cases, such as immersion in boiling water, armor may provide no protection, at the storyguide's option. Note that Hermetic magi get a bonus to Soak from their Form scores, which may well apply to non-combat sources of injury.

These rules are also used for calculating damage inflicted by spells, including during combat.

Non-combat Damage Total: Damage Bonus + Stress Die

Non-combat Soak Total: Soak Total + Stress Die.

<span id="heat-and-corrosion"></span>
=== heat and Corrosion ===

The damage modifiers for heat and corrosion depend on how much of the character is covered, and how intense the source is. If the source covers a small part of the character, such as a hand or foot, it does its base damage. If it covers an entire limb, the damage bonus is doubled. If half the character's body is within the source, the damage bonus is tripled, while complete immersion quadruples the damage bonus. (Note that spell damage already includes the modifier for amount of exposure.) These multipliers are applied before the stress die is added.

The damage is inflicted once every six seconds (once per combat round), and the wounds caused are independent, as for combat wounds (see page 404 for details). These sources of damage tend to ruin items as well, at the storyguide's discretion.

<span id="xii-realms"></span>
== XII. Realms ==

agic is the supernatural basis of Ars Magica, but it is not the only power in Mythic Europe. Four realms of power exist: Magic, Divine, Faerie, and Infernal.

There also exists the mundane, that which is not supernatural. The lines between realms are not drawn simply, with some on one side and others representing a united opposition. Rather, each has some influence over the rest.

Each realm has a distinctive aura, which covers some areas of the world. Within an aura, one realm is stronger than the others, and this local strength affects the use of the powers of other realms. These auras vary in strength, and some only appear at particular times or under particular circumstances.

Creatures can be linked to a realm in one of two ways. The closer link is referred to as 'belonging to' or 'being part of' a realm. These creatures are drawn from the realm's nature, and embody some aspect of its power. The more distant link is referred to as 'alignment' or 'affiliation'. A creature that is affiliated to a realm can draw on the powers of that realm, but is not drawn from the realm's nature. A creature that belongs to a realm cannot be affiliated with any other realm. Most creatures belong to no realm, and can affiliate to more than one. Magi, for example, are affiliated to the realm of Magic but do not belong to it. Christian, Jewish, or Islamic magi are affiliated to the Magic realm and the Divine realm, but, again, belong to neither. While it is possible for animals, plants, or even stones, to become affiliated to a realm, this is most common for human beings. All kinds of creatures belong to the various realms.

No human being belongs to a realm. It is possible for a human affiliated to a realm to transform and become part of that realm, but the person apparently loses their humanity in the process. There are faeries, demons, and spirits that were once human, but the Divine realm never transforms human beings in this world. Perhaps the saints after death become part of the Divine realm, but there is no way to know.

<span id="the-nature-of-the-realms"></span>
= The Nature of the Realms =

Il four realms are inter-related, and Hermetic theorists have debated the nature of these relations for centuries. It is generally agreed that the Divine

realm is more powerful than the other three, possibly infinitely so. As Hermetic magi make use of the power of the Magic realm, they tend to see that realm as more important than the Faerie and Infernal realms. There are two popular views of the relationship between the realms in the Order, one inspired by Platonic philosophy, the other by Aristotelian.

The Platonic view sees the Divine realm as the source of light and being for the universe. The Magic realm is the first emanation of the Divine realm, pure light as emitted from the divine being. The Faerie and Infernal realms both arise from the interaction of the divine light with human beings.

The Faerie realm is the reflection of this light from the minds and souls of humankind, while the Infernal realm is the shadow cast by humanity. Thus the Faerie realm tends to make the stories and dreams of humanity real, while the Infernal contains all of humanity's flaws made concrete.

The Aristotelian view sees things slightly differently. The Divine is pure actuality, ultimate existence. The Magic realm is the process of coming into existence, and thus always below the Divine but always getting closer. The Faerie realm is the actualization of the imagination of human beings, while the Infernal is the process of going out of existence. Thus, demons always seek to destroy.

Hermetic theorists have also come up with much more personal theories, but most magi hold some version of one of the two accounts given here, when they think about the issue at all.

Those theologians who give serious thought to the issue tend to have a slightly different view of the issue. They see the Divine as the supernatural realm, the mundane as the natural realm, and Magic, Faerie, and Infernal as together making up the preternatural realm. Opinions are divided as to whether the three components of the preternatural realm are actually distinct, and thus over whether there is really any difference between the Infernal and the Magical. Even among those who accept that the three preternatural realms are truly distinct, there is a debate over whether magic is sinful, and incompatible with a truly spiritual life, in itself

<span id="realm-auras"></span>
== Realm Auras ==

he realms exist and interact in various ways. Each has some parts of the world where its powers are strongest. Such areas are said to have an aura, which can be rated

in power on a scale from 1 to 10. Most auras rate between 1 and 5, while very intense auras may have a strength of 6 to 10. An aura rating of 10 often designates a gateway to the realm of its affiliation. The aura rating of a given area usually acts as a modifier on supernatural activities that take place there. Many areas of the world have no realm affiliation, and therefore no aura. These places are mundane.

Within a supernatural area, the aura rating is usually uniform, but occasionally energy is unevenly concentrated, causing variable aura ratings. Sometimes conditions result in the development of regiones, areas of increasingly powerful aura sharing a single physical location (see &quot;Regiones&quot; on page 420).

Two realms may have influence over the same place. When this is the case, only the stronger can hold sway at any one time. A change in the relative strengths of the two realms can cause an area to switch from the influence of one to the other. For example, a village might be built on the site of an ancient faerie mound. Normally, the area has a Dominion aura (because the villagers are followers of the Church). However, at night (when Dominion power wanes) or on the days of ancient pagan holidays the Faerie aura becomes more powerful and holds sway. Sometimes only a small area, like the cellar of a tavern, feels the touch of a power different from that of its surroundings.

<span id="realm-interaction"></span>
== '''Realm Interaction''' ==

The aura of a given place affects all supernatural activities that go on in that place. The list below defines how aura ratings affect various activities. The Realm Interaction chart that follows indicates

the degree to which realms influence powers of other realms. The modifiers shown apply to the effect an aura has on any supernatural act performed within it.

Auras also affect the number of botch rolls for an attempted supernatural act in a foreign realm. For each point of aura rating, roll an extra botch die. Use the original aura rating, not that obtained after multiplying by a factor in the Realm Interaction chart.

For example, consider a magus who also has a Faerie-based power to create illusions and a demonic gift causing sickness. His Hermetic spells are based on Magic, his illusions on Faerie, and his sickness power on the Infernal. In a town with a Dominion aura of 3, he must subtract nine from his Hermetic totals, and roll three additional botch dice, twelve from his Faerie illusion totals, with three additional botch dice, and fifteen from his Infernal sickening totals, again with

<span id="supernatural-activity-rolls-modified-by-aura"></span>
== Supernatural Activity Rolls Modified by Aura ==

Spellcasting: The aura modifier modifies the Casting Score.

LABORATORY ACTIVITIES: The aura modifier modifies the Lab Total.

ABILITY ROLLS: The aura modifier affects supernatural Abilities such as Second Sight, or Wilderness Sense. Most such abilities are Magical in origin, although in particular cases they may be Faerie, Infernal, or even Divine.

MAGIC RESISTANCE: Magic Resistance is altered by the aura modifier. This includes Hermetic Magic Resistance due to the Parma Magica and Forms, as well as the resistance of creatures with supernatural Might. Thus, a magus in a Magic aura of 4 has a +4 bonus to his Magic Resistance, while a demon has a -4 penalty.

PENETRATION: For magi and characters with mystical abilities, the aura modifies the roll to use the ability, which means that Penetration is modified. The aura modifier does not apply to Penetration twice. Thus, a magus in a Divine aura of 2 takes a –6 penalty to his Casting Score. This automatically reduces his Penetration, as that is calculated by subtracting the spell level from the Casting Score. The aura modifier is not subtracted again from the Penetration total. For supernatural creatures, there is no roll to use the ability (see page 426), so the aura modifier applies to Penetration directly.

three additional botch dice. If he moves to a forest with a Faerie aura of 4, he adds two to his Hermetic totals, but rolls four additional botch dice, four to his Faerie illusion totals, with no additional botch dice, and subtracts four from his Infernal sickening totals, again with four additional botch dice.

The Divine is not hampered by auras of other kinds. Divine powers have no penalty and no additional botch dice in auras of the other realms.

<span id="creatures-of-a-realm"></span>
== Creatures of a Realm ==

he appearance of a creature is influenced, but not determined, by the realm to which it belongs. The details on each of the realms, below, provide

further information on this. A creature's realm of origin does, however, strongly affect the way it interacts with human beings. Creatures of the Infernal are always interested in corrupting and harming human beings, while creatures of the Magic realm need have no interest in human beings for their own sake. Creatures of the Divine serve God, and thus punish, aid, and reward humanity as commanded. Creatures of Faerie all have some relationship with human beings, but the nature of this relationship can vary wildly.

A talking dog, for example, could belong to any of the four realms. As a Faerie, it might be the perfect hunting dog, leading its master on apparently impossible hunts and lending its powers to ensure success. As an Infernal beast, it would try to corrupt its master, leading him into evil. A Divine talking dog would be a companion to its master, offering guidance, but also driving him back from sin by force if necessary. Finally, a Magical talking dog might have no interest at all in human beings, being interested only in hunting for its food in the wilderness.

<span id="magic-resistance-and-penetration"></span>
== Magic Resistance and Penetration ==

Most creatures that belong to a realm have a Might Score, which represents their power. The creature's Might Score is the maximum level. Might points are also spent to invoke supernatural abilities, and Might Pool is the amount of Might that a creature has remaining. Magic Resistance and Penetration are both based on a creature's Might Score.

Creature Magic Resistance: Might Score + Aura Modifier

CREATURE PENETRATION:

Might Score – (5 × Might Points spent on power) + Penetration Bonus + Aura Modifier

Magic Resistance based on might functions like Hermetic resistance, resisting the powers of all realms, and all types of supernatural power.

Characters with supernatural abilities other than Hermetic magic also have Penetration.

CHARACTER PENETRATION: Effect Roll – Ease Factor + Penetration Bonus

* Aura Modifier

The Penetration bonus is calculated in the same way as for Hermetic magi (see Penetration, page 215). Thus, creatures and characters without the Penetration Ability have a Penetration bonus of zero.

== The Magic Realm ==

he Magic realm is often characterized as 'the way the world could be'. Magical things are simply better than the mundane versions, but they are

better versions of mundane things, not completely new things. There are often many ways in which a thing could be better, and magical things better in each of those ways exist. ''Realms of Power: Magic'' provides more detail on this realm.

<span id="magical-creatures-1"></span>
== Magical Creatures ==

Many magical creatures look like particularly fine specimens of mundane things, and although they may have surprising abilities, such as intelligence or the ability to move, these abilities are always suitable to the kind of creature in question. The abilities of magical creatures are explicable, at least after the event, in terms of the abilities of the mundane version, although those abilities may be somewhat hidden. For example, goat's blood can dissolve diamonds, but this ability is only obvious in magical goats. Magical animals, so-called beasts of virtue (see Realms of Power: Magic, pages 55-68), are the most obvious magical creatures, but there are also magical plants, most notably among the trees, and elementals, described in the Bestiary chapter. On the whole, magical animals tend to be more intelligent and have more personality than magical plants, which in turn are superior to elementals in those respects. Some magical creatures are shapechangers, and some of these can take on human form. The human form is almost never the natural form of a shapechanger who belongs to the Magic realm, however. The shapechangers are wolves who can become human,

The Magic realm also encompasses a wide range of spirits. Some are spirits of natural substances, such as water and fire. These are generally classed with elementals, although there is a difference in that elementals are essentially physical, while spirits of the elements are essentially spiritual. Since spirits of the elements can generally create the physical element, this distinction is only of importance to Hermetic magi deciding which Form to use to affect a creature. Other magic spirits include spirits of natural places and natural phenomena, such as the spirit of a mountain or of storms. Many powerful magical spirits can take on any form they wish, including human form, and some have powers based on several aspects of the Magic realm. These spirits are normally completely indifferent to human beings, but some enter into mutually profitable

arrangements, particularly with humans who are affiliated to the Magic realm in the first place.

Powerful spirits may take on forms that are completely alien to human beings, and any creature that is powerful, alien, and indifferent to human beings is part of the Magic realm. Such creatures are very rare, but they do exist.

Human beings who have been transformed to become part of the Magic realm are rare, but make up an important group of the realm's inhabitants. Some of them are undead, such as ghosts and animated corpses, although it is just as common for such creatures to be part of the Faerie or Infernal realms. Others still appear human, but are not. Still others have taken on different forms. Finally, some have become powerful spirits. These creatures of magic have more interest in humans than most others, as they were once human themselves. Some within the Order believe that Hermes was originally a great human magician, who became a spirit and was worshiped as a god by the Greeks and Romans.

It is relatively common for human beings to have supernatural powers that derive from the Magic realm, and thus to be affiliated with that realm. Hermetic magi are the most obvious example, but ''Hedge Magic Revised Edition'' and ''Rival Magic'', along with many other supplements, contain further examples. There are human shapechangers who can change into wolves, but the magical ones are affiliated with the realm, rather than belonging to it.

<span id="magical-auras"></span>
== Magical Auras ==

Magical areas are places that are more real than those around them. Sometimes, after the working of powerful magic or the death of a powerful creature, places acquire a magical aura, but most of the time it is unclear why a certain place is magical. Most magical areas have an aura from 1 to 5. Legendary places are rated around 6, while auras of strength 10 are virtually unknown.

Magical areas are intense. Colors are more striking, sounds more piercing, the day brighter, the night deeper. Magical creatures are particularly common within them, although mobile creatures can wander elsewhere. Immobile magical creatures, such as magical trees, are almost never found outside a magical aura.

Almost all covenants are located in magical areas, usually with aura ratings of 1 to 5. More powerful areas are not only rare but extremely dangerous to live in. The powerful magic there is difficult and dangerous to harness, and mundane covenfolk become warped and strange. Apprentices are often overpowered. Because of this threat, only the most powerful covenants in Hermetic history have based themselves in such places. Powerful Magic auras are even richer in vis

than normal ones, however, so magi often want to visit such places.

Magical auras do not tend to have cyclical variations in strength with time, in the way that other auras do, nor do they depend on the surroundings, like Faerie auras. Much more detail is available in chapter 2 of ''Realms of Power: Magic''.

<span id="sources-of-magical-auras"></span>
== Sources of Magical Auras ==

There are two main ways in which Magical auras arise: from the arrangement of the world, and from magical activities. Weak Magical auras arise in places where the world has naturally become a particularly fine example of something. A perfect mountain, spectacular and ancient forest, and a vigorous active volcano might all acquire a weak Magical aura, normally 1 and certainly no higher than 2. Stronger auras arise from combinations of a superb location and auspicious astrological alignments, or from a combination of excellent examples of the natural world. For example, a coastal valley hemmed in by mountains, in which great storms often happen and which faces the midsummer sunrise might have a Magical aura as high as 4. These alignments never produce an aura higher than 5, at least not by themselves, and such places are popular sites for covenants, as they are easier to find than the other kind.

Magical auras can also arise from magical activities. If a moderately powerful (Might 30 or more) magical creature takes up residence in an area, that place will, over the course of years, acquire a weak Magical aura. Similarly, a place where magicians constantly work magic slowly acquires an aura if it did not already have one. More powerful magical creatures and more powerful magical events create stronger auras, but generally no stronger than level 5.

Auras above level 5 almost always result from a combination of good location and magical activities. If a covenant were established in a location with a natural aura of 5, the aura would rise over the course of decades, but not, in general, any higher than 7. The very highest Magical auras result from spectacular magical events, such as a spectacular magical fight between two powerful magical creatures in which one of the creatures was killed, or the creation of a magical effect worthy of legend. Such events can create an aura of 2 or 3 in a previously mundane area, and if they take place in a location that already has a strong Magical aura they can push it to the highest levels.

<span id="the-magic-world"></span>
== The Magic World ==

There is great debate within the Order of Hermes over the existence of a magical equivalent to Arcadia, Heaven, and Hell. Most magi think that there must be one, and some even claim to have visited it. Others think that those magi have

either visited a powerful Magical regio, or have decided to lie. It is rather difficult to see how a magus could distinguish a large powerful regio from a part of a whole magical world, which tends to prolong the debate.

Other magi hold that, while there is a Magic world, it cannot be visited. Some say that it is the realm of Twilight, so it cannot be visited safely, others that it is the realm of the Platonic Forms, where the perfect exemplars for all earthly things are found. Still others argue that, as the Magic realm is constituted by striving towards the Divine, or by the first emanation from the Divine, the Magic world is Heaven. Some of these also believe that Twilight is the Magic world, so that Final Twilight is a way for magi to enter Heaven.

As described in chapter 3 of ''Realms of Power: Magic'', there is a Magic world, and Hermetic magi could visit it. They simply have not, in 1220. The magi in your saga might well be the first.

<span id="the-infernal-realm"></span>
== The Infernal Realm ==

he Infernal realm is the embodiment of evil and decay of physical destruction and moral corruption. Even as the Church works its divine power to protect

the soul and buoy it up to Heaven after the body's death, the forces of the Devil work to steal it away and drag it to the depths of Hell.

Human beings are subject to death and damnation through the sins of their ancestral parents. Once Adam and Eve had tasted the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, all the world came under Satan's influence.

Demons are fallen angels; they cannot and will not be redeemed because of their very natures. They comprehend the divine order completely and so can never be convinced by new arguments or perspectives to seek salvation. Their envy of humanity's place in the cosmos is without bounds, as is their capacity for evil as rejection of all that is from God. Ultimately, devils seek to weigh down souls with the baggage of sin. They have an eternity to plot and scheme, and a human lifetime is a brief moment in their eyes. Fortunately for humanity, they are completely without virtue, including the virtues of patience and self-control, which makes it hard for them to sustain elaborate plans.

Hell's most potent allies are diabolists, humans who sell their souls in return for powers and favors on Earth. Not only do devils win these souls away from the Divine, they are also able to satisfy their lust for chaos, destruction and suffering through these human agents. The powers that diabolists are

awarded can include spell-like abilities and the capacity to summon demons and use them to their own ends, among other things. Diabolists are not completely without virtue, and are indeed capable of redemption, which means that they can provide the patience and self-control that demons lack.

Not surprisingly, the Order of Hermes forbids dealings with demonkind. Any member caught engaging in diabolism is renounced and singled out for destruction. Furthermore, the Church brings down great punishments on those thought or known to be in league with the Devil.

Hell is not a remote force in Mythic Europe. Demons ruin crops, cause back pains, make the wind howl, and manipulate emotions. Some theologians suggest that it is impossible to drop a needle from the roof of a house without hitting an invisible demon in pursuit of a plan of evil.

More details on the Infernal and all its works can be found in ''Realms of Power: The Infernal''.

<span id="infernal-creatures"></span>
== Infernal Creatures ==

The natural forms of infernal creatures are almost always twisted, vile, and terrifying, the better to inspire fear and loathing in human beings. However, many demons can also take on attractive forms. Different sorts of attraction are better for different temptations, a beautiful young

woman is good for luring a man into lust, but an apparently wise old man might be better to lure someone into heresy.

The lies of creatures that belong to the Infernal realm cannot be detected by the powers of the Magic realm. Deceit is a central part of their nature, and hard to overcome. Some diabolists claim that infernal power can pierce infernal lies, but most magi believe that the demons are lying to their servants. The Divine can pierce infernal deceptions, and it seems that some faeries can also do so. This ability to lie with impunity also makes demons hard to detect; they can choose to tell the magic that they are not there, and the magic will believe them.

This does not mean that it is impossible to spot demonic lies by any means. Normal investigation will still reveal whether things are as a demon says, unless the demon has made the effort to fake mundane information as well.

<span id="infernal-auras"></span>
== Infernal Auras ==

Infernal areas are among the most vile places in the world. Growth of natural plants is stunted and warped. Decay and the stench of ill humors abound. Predatory animals kill, not for survival, but for the pleasure of inflicting pain. Most earthbound demons, and many diabolists, prefer to remain in such areas. They are also typical sites for diabolic churches and covens, and for the summoning of demons.

Travelers in or near Infernal areas often find themselves in foul moods. Outlaws on nearby roads act in particularly harsh fashion—the effects of demonic influence in high concentration. Old wounds, especially those received through malevolence, hurt anew. Old conflicts and personality clashes are remembered again, and possibly re-enacted. Of greater concern to magi, Infernal auras interfere with the use of magic.

Infernal auras can be detected by magic, unless an infernal creature is actively hiding their existence. They also tend to reduce in strength during the day, and particularly on holy days, and to increase in power at night. Infernal auras are particularly strong on Easter Saturday, the day between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. More detail can be found in ''Realms of Power: The Infernal'', pages 10–17.

<span id="sources-of-infernal-auras"></span>
=== Sources of Infernal Auras ===

Infernal auras arise from sinful activities and from the activities of demons and diabolists. Minor sins, of the sort that people commit every day, do not create an Infernal aura, fortunately. More serious sins, such as vicious murders, or elaborate schemes to corrupt someone, can leave a trace. A single sin only creates an aura if it is particularly vile. The calculated desecration of a

church, including the ritual murder of the priest on the altar, might replace the church's Divine aura with a level 1 Infernal aura. In an area with no aura, a cruel and premeditated murder can create a level 1 aura. Repeated sins in one place create Infernal auras, even if the individual sins are less serious. For example, if a pair of adulterers met every couple of days in the same room in order to indulge their sin, that room would slowly acquire a weak Infernal aura, which might reach level 2 if the affair continued for long enough. Repeated ritual sacrifices of human beings to demons, extending over many decades, could create an Infernal aura as high as 5.

Infernal auras also arise from the presence of infernal creatures or the use of infernal powers, in much the same way as for Magical auras. Combining repeated sin with the use of infernal powers can create the highest Infernal auras of all.

<span id="the-faerie-realm"></span>
== The Faerie Realm ==

aeries are creatures drawn in some way from the stories of the human race. They are thus as varied and diverse as stories, and can be found anywhere from the depths

of the wilderness to the centers of cities, from ancient pagan temples to the newest cathedral.

The realm of Faerie is as diverse and strange as those who inhabit it, and as with all faerie things, appearances can be deceiving. After dawn breaks, a pile of gold may prove nothing more than old leaves, while a single oak leaf can hold within it more magical power than the enchanted staff of a mighty magus.

Much more detail about the Faerie realm can be found in Realms of Power: Faerie.

<span id="paerie-oreatures"></span>
== Paerie Oreatures ==

The special relationship that faeries have to humanity means that all faeries are interested in people. They are interested in having humans play out their stories, because faeries gain energy, called Vitality, when this happens. Unlike demons, they do not want humans to be corrupted or destroyed for the sake of corruption, but some faeries do want humans to suffer, if the story calls for it. Other faeries live in imitation or mockery of human beings, and they respond to human intruders as appropriate to their role, bringing the visitors into their story.

Not all faeries know that they are telling a story, and the faerie may be the victim in a story. For example, a faerie may be the giant that is

tricked by a clever mortal child. In that case, the faerie, consciously or unconsciously, arranges things so that the child can trick it and survive. If it catches the child or sees through the trick, it does not get any Vitality. This close link to stories means that faeries are very hard to predict if you do not know what their story is — and very easy to manipulate if you do. Nevertheless, a faerie that tells the story of the Wild Hunt carrying people away and driving them mad may remain very dangerous even when you know exactly what it is.

Faeries cannot truly create or change without mortal assistance. However, a faerie might be able to make wine with a word and change its form from moment to moment, as the wine is actually a transformation of something, and the form of the faerie is essentially mutable. It seems to be absolutely true that faeries cannot reproduce themselves, or learn, without mortal aid, and in these cases things do not even appear otherwise.

Faerie creatures can take any imaginable form. This includes appearing as better versions of mundane animals, but also includes giants, chimerae, and humans with animal features. Since faeries arise from the stories of humanity, it is not uncommon for legends about a magical place to give rise to a faerie copy, more closely matching the beliefs that people have. However, although faeries arise from the beliefs of people, they do not always go away or change to match changing beliefs. Once the faeries exist, they are just as real as any other creature, and can, with the help of humans, develop in unexpected ways.

<span id="paerie-auras"></span>
== Paerie Auras ==

Areas of faerie power may cover ancient pagan lands, spring up about faerie monarchs, or protect valued locations. They may have only a few inhabitants, each quite powerful. On the other hand, they may be the domiciles of innumerable faeries with little power individually, but whose numbers give them strength enough to be respected and avoided.

Faerie areas with lower level auras tend to be inhabited by faeries that are merely annoying, or barely more than helpful; they are almost never capable of killing. Such places are relatively common wherever mortals have spread their influence. On the other hand, especially in rural areas, there are auras of immense power inhabited by faeries that can will themselves taller than a church spire or shake the Earth's foundation at a command.

Sites of Faerie aura take as many forms as their inhabitants. They might contain talking trees and owls, strange lights at night, and unearthly eyes peering out of the darkness. An aura may exceed the physical bounds of the locale, depending on how far the resident faeries journey or extend their power.

Regardless of the danger, magi often risk entering Faerie areas in pursuit of magical power. They are places rich in vis — reason enough to challenge many perils, particularly for a magus deprived of magical resources.

Faerie auras tend to vary in strength depending on how closely the surrounding world matches the nature of the faeries within. Thus, a Faerie aura inhabited by beautiful faeries of light would reduce in power during winter and at night, and reach its full power on bright summer days. An aura inhabited by faerie miners would lose strength if there were no miners nearby, but return to full power if a mine was opened. More details on Faerie auras can be found in ''Realms of Power: Faerie'', pages 14–18.

to say otherwise. The

combination of

Faerie auras can arise from the presence of faeries or the use of faerie powers in a way similar to the ways that Magical and Infernal auras can arise. Faerie auras also arise when stories are told about a place. The strength of the aura depends on the popularity and number of the stories, but also on what is already in a place. For example, many people in western Mythic Europe tell marvelous stories about Constantinople, but as the city is full of people and churches these stories have not created a Faerie aura there. On the other hand, stories about the strange beings who live in the depths of a forest often create auras, as no-one lives in the forest

these effects means that Faerie auras are often in wilderness areas, even though faeries depend, in some sense, on human beings.

Faerie auras tend to be higher than other kinds of aura, as the two factors reinforce one another. Faeries in an area tend to inspire stories about the area, which in turn raise the aura and attract, or create, more and more powerful faeries, who in turn inspire more stories.

<span id="the-facric-realm"></span>
== The Facric Realm ==

The most powerful Faerie sites are sometimes gateways to the Faerie Realm. Such gateways may be small and unassuming, rarely used and little known, or massive entrances traversed by the greatest of faerie entities. Mortals do not naturally belong in the land of the fay, and those who enter often fail to return. Even if they do come back, they may find a day spent in Faerie is one, ten, even a hundred years, or only a minute, in the mundane world. Magi of House Merinita say that the Faerie Realm can be divided into three &quot;regions&quot;, although they are not geographic divisions: Arcadia, Elysium, and Eudokia.

Arcadia is best described as stories made real. The impossible city paved with gold is found in Arcadia, as is the enormous forest inhabited by talking animals. Everything plays its role within a story of some sort, and all stories can be found here.

Elysium is the land of myths, the home of gods and heroes, and Eudokia is the land of tales that teach a lesson.

The Faerie Realm is a physical place, but it is also a sphere of pure enchantment and imagination. Movement is not easily described, being more like the half-remembered travels of a dream, and so magi of House Merinita (who know best) scoff at the idea of making a map of it. Like a dream state, Faerieland is often incomprehensible to mortals who go there. There is not always a logical relationship between cause and effect, and it is easy to become totally disoriented, especially as faeries enjoy using their glamor to lead intruders astray. And yet, some Merinita magi insist that the Faerie Realm is not a chaotic place, but merely has its own rules. Whether this is true or not, the realm is best left to faeries, and to the foolish among mortals.

<span id="the-divine-realm"></span>
== The Divine Realm ==

he Divine realm is the manifestation of the supernatural power of God. The most obvious agent of the Divine in western Europe is the

Church, and Divine auras, also called the Dominion, or Dominion auras, surround its buildings. The Church does not have a monopoly on Divine auras, as Jews and Muslims also live within a Dominion aura, which appears indistinguishable from that of the Church. The Church, of course, refuses to believe that Islam has anything to do with God, and has severe doubts about contemporary Judaism.

Regardless of opinions, it cannot be denied that the Divine realm has an influence over the other realms, including that of Magic. A Divine aura limits the efficiency and effectiveness of Hermetic magic, and Divine miracles can accomplish feats that magi cannot.

At its best, the Dominion allows the human soul to express its deepest beauty. At its worst, the Church is a repressive force that treads on liberal thought. It makes sense, then, that it is the Church which is the driving force behind the Crusades while it produces the most delightful music, the most enchanting art, and the most transcendent philosophy.

The power of the Church and the boundaries it imposes on the Order of Hermes cause some magi to scorn the Divine. Some magi find pagan religions, based as they are on Faerie or Magical power, more congenial, while others simply have as little as possible to do with religion. Nevertheless, many magi are Christians, with a scattering of Jews and a significant number of

Muslims in those tribunals which extend over Islamic lands. Some magi even have True Faith (see page 113), which does not seem to hinder their magic.

More detail about the supernatural aspects of the Divine can be found in ''Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition'' along with information about the three most important Divine religions in Mythic Europe: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.

<span id="divine-auras"></span>
== Divine Auras ==

The Dominion is nearly ubiquitous, and is the only supernatural power that the common folk generally have contact with. It affects magi and their fellows whenever they enter a village, town, or city where there is a place of worship, an ordained priest, and a body of believers.

Though Divine auras are almost always present in areas inhabited by believers, their strength can vary. On Sundays and holy days the power of the Dominion increases; at night and on evil days it wanes. The Dominion is also focused more strongly in places and objects that are strongly associated with faith. People, places, and things that have been blessed by an ordained priest can carry Divine auras, but these are extremely fragile and vanish once exposed to the sinful world. Divine auras somehow transported to another realm are also swallowed by the alien aura.

Entering a strong Divine aura has a definite sensory association. Non-magical people often experience anticipatory nerves and unconscious reverence. Those who are pious feel quiet peace; others feel dread and guilt. Magi and others with magical talents instantly sense a powerful presence, their Gift flickering as a flame exposed to wind. Auras of lesser power might prove a mild irritant to such magical folk, perhaps causing occasional headaches, short tempers and sporadic feelings of physical discomfort.

<span id="sources-of-divine-auras"></span>
== Sources of Divine Auras ==

Divine auras can arise from the activities or presence of holy creatures, in a manner similar to the ways in which other auras arise. The overwhelming majority of Divine auras, however, arise from the presence of faithful worshipers of the Divine. Typically, the fields around a village would have an aura of 1, while the village itself would have an aura of 2. A town or city would have an aura of 3 over most of the area, possibly lower in areas where sin and vice are common. Most places of worship have an aura of 4, while places with wider significance, such as cathedrals, important mosques, and the churches of major monasteries, have an aura of 5.

Higher Divine auras are very limited in extent. The chapel holding the relics of a very important saint might have an aura of 6, or 7 for relics of

Christ or the Virgin Mary. The site of a saint's martyrdom generally has an aura of 8, nine for the martyrdom of an apostle. Divine auras of 10 arise in places where God Himself has intervened in a direct way. The Holy Sepulcher, where Christ was buried, the ka'aba in Mecca, and the last remnants of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem are examples. There are occasional examples elsewhere; for example, the Lady Chapel at Glastonbury Abbey in England was originally consecrated by Christ Himself, and has an aura of 10.

Particular Divine auras may depart from these guidelines, as God makes them where and how He wants. However, the guidelines given here are the ones that He normally seems to follow. While He could withdraw all of the Divine aura from a cathedral, He almost never does so. For more details on Divine auras, see Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, pages 10–17.

<span id="true-faith-1"></span>
== True Faith ==

Those who give up mundane pursuits entirely and selflessly dedicate themselves to leading holy lives benefit from True Faith. True Faith is measured in Faith Points, which represent a person's connection to God. Those with True Faith may be Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, and, it seems, need not be wholly orthodox.

True Faith, like Confidence, has a Score and Points. Taking the True Faith Major Virtue grants you a True Faith Score of 1, and a single Faith Point. Only by possessing the True Faith Major

Virtue may a character have a True Faith score. Any character may possess any number of Faith Points (gained through the sacraments, a pilgrimage, or other holy endeavors) that once spent, do not return.

You may spend Faith Points like Confidence Points (and may spend as many Faith Points at once as your True Faith Score), as long as you are acting in accordance with God's will. If you do not possess a True Faith Score, then you may only spend one Faith Point at a time.

A character with Faith Points but no True Faith Score does not benefit from Magic Resistance. A character with a True Faith Score gains Magic Resistance equal to this score multiplied by ten.

<span id="true-faith-magic-resistance-true-faith-score-x-10"></span>
==== True Faith Magic Resistance: True Faith Score x 10 ====

Each dawn, you regain a number of Faith Points up to your True Faith Score, although if you already have more Faith Points than your True Faith Score, you do not gain additional Points.

For more details on True Faith, see Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition, page 56.

<span id="relics"></span>
==== Relics ====

Relics are physical objects that, in some way, house part of the power of the Divine. They are most common in Christianity, and often take the form of parts of the bodies of deceased saints. All relics have a number of common powers, listed below:

<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Faith: All relics contain a True Faith score, giving it Faith Points that may be used by its bearer as Confidence. A relic also grants Magic Resistance equal to ten times its True Faith score to its bearer. A person can only benefit from one relic at a time, any attempt to do otherwise is a sin, and means that they lose the benefits of all relics. However, a person can humbly carry other relics, while only relying on one for the benefits. A character who normally relies on a particular relic would need a very good reason to swap it for another one.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>DIVINE MIGHT: All relics have a Divine Might score, which limits how often their powers may be used (effectively preventing characters from over-using their powers). The Might score also acts as Magic Resistance for the relic against any spells or supernatural effects that target it directly. A relic's Divine Might is equal to the relic's Faith score (or highest Faith score, if more than one applies) multiplied by 10, and the Might Pool is refreshed with every sunrise.</li></ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Scourging the Infernal: As supremely holy items, relics are anathema to demons and their followers. Relics radiate an aura of hostility to such creatures that extends a number of feet equal to the Might score of the relic. Any</li></ol></li></ul>

creatures belonging to the Infernal realm that seek to enter this aura will be unable to do so if their Infernal Might does not exceed the Divine Might of the relic. Should they succeed in entering the aura, every round that they remain within it they will be assailed by divine energies causing an amount of damage equal to the Might of the relic, although their Soak still protects them as normal. The assault is accompanied by suitably dramatic visual effects, such as holy fire, lightning, or whatever the storyguide feels is appropriate. It ends as soon as they leave the aura. This power does not affect characters or creatures merely affiliated with the Infernal realm, though they will feel discomfort if they handle the relics for extended periods of time.

In addition, some relics have powers specific to them. In the case of relics of saints, these powers usually match those of the saint to whom they once belonged. In the case of other relics, the powers are conferred directly by Divine Will. Two sample powers are given here, more can be found on pages 88 and 89 of ''Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition''.

<span id="miracles"></span>
== Miracles ==

Miracles are the direct intervention of God in the world. As such, they can do anything, cannot fail, and cannot be resisted by any other power. More discussion of their role in the setting can be found in the Mythic Europe chapter, on page 505.

<span id="magic-resistance-for-church-officers-and-sovereigns"></span>
== Magic Resistance For Church Officers and Sovereigns ==

The Divine protects the ordained and anointed leaders of Mythic Europe from interference by other supernatural powers. The religious and secular leaders listed below receive a Magic Resistance score as listed here, and a Soak bonus equal to Magic Resistance / 5. Excommunication cancels these benefits (but only if the excommunication is God's will). Those listed here also have a Penetration 0 Aura of Rightful Authority extending to Voice Range. Roughly speaking, a legatus a latere is a cleric authorized to act on behalf of the Pope, with his power. A legatus missus has the same authorization, but for a single purpose. For more details, see ''The Church'', page 31.

* Pope 25
* Cardinal or Legatus a latere 20
* Legatus missus 15
* Archbishop 10
* King (once crowned) 10
* Wives gain Magic Resistance equal to their husbands'.
* Magic Resistance from relics is added to the above, but does not affect Soak.

<span id="the-mundane"></span>
== The Mundane ==

he mundane is the embodiment of all that is normal and mortal. Generally speaking, areas not occupied by another realm are considered mundane and

consist of ordinary people and places. The mundane has no aura rating — in fact, it is the absence of aura, so powers used there function without hindrance.

There is a difference between &quot;mundane society&quot; and mundane areas. Mundane society comprises the everyday folk of Mythic Europe, including peasants, townsfolk, and nobility. These people, not being supernatural, would seem to belong to the mundane. However, widespread belief in God, and the fact that most settlements are within the Dominion, means that most &quot;mundanes&quot; actually share somewhat in the Divine. Only complete outsiders who lack faith are truly to be considered part of the mundane.

<span id="regiones"></span>
== Regiones ==

ccasionally, within very special supernatural areas, special types of auras arise. These may exist within larger domains or by themselves, and may be of any type of aura.

They are called regiones (singular regio, &quot;realm&quot;, pronounced 'REH-ghee-oh' and 'reh-ghee-OH-nays', with a hard 'g' in both cases).

Regiones consist of several levels of aura, layered one on top of another in order of increasing power; the lowest level is connected to the mundane world. To picture this phenomenon,

imagine a building with multiple floors. The ground floor is the level of the regio connected to the mundane world, while the higher floors are the higher levels of the regio. To climb, you must use the stairs, and to do that you must know where they are, or wander around until you bump into them. The higher floors have higher auras, and so have more characteristics of their realm.

Just as the various floors of a building occupy the same spot of ground, so do the various levels of a regio occupy the same bit of space. It is entirely possible to pass through the bottom level of a regio without realizing that there are more levels than meet the eye.

Regiones have inhabitants, just like other areas of supernatural aura. These beings tend to cluster on specific levels, though they can cross level boundaries freely. The higher one travels in the regio, the stranger and more supernaturally aligned its inhabitants become.

<span id="example-2-and-example-3-regiones"></span>
== '''Example 2''' And '''Example 3 Regiones''' ==

Any character crossing the boundary of a regio disappears from the normal world and enters a supernatural realm. There are three ways to enter most regiones: being led, entering voluntarily, and getting lost.

Any being native to a regio and part of or affiliated to the realm can lead any number of characters to any level of the regio. Magi are affiliated to the Magic realm, and if they live in a Magical regio they count as native to that regio.

There are two ways to enter a regio voluntarily, and either or both may apply to a particular regio. The first involves seeing into the regio and then crossing the boundary. This requires some supernatural ability. Second Sight allows a character to see into any regio, as does Magic Sensitivity. Sense Holiness and Unholiness allows a character to see into Divine and Infernal regiones.

To see into a regio level, roll:

Regio Sight Roll: Perception + Appropriate Ability + Stress Die

EASE FACTOR:

5 + (2 × difference between current level's aura and sought level's aura)

If you are in an aura different from the aura of the regio, add the current aura and the aura of the regio level to determine the Ease Factor. Thus, the Ease Factor to see from a level 3 Divine aura into a level 5 Magic regio is 21, the difference between these two auras is 8. The Ease Factor may be modified by large amounts on particular days or by particular activities.

Anyone who can see the next level of a regio can lead any number of people into it.

The second way of entering involves following a particular path or ritual. Sometimes, following the path is enough by itself, and no rolls are needed. In other cases, the rolls specified for seeing into a regio must still be made, but unless the path is followed there is no chance of success. The path can be as simple as walking seven times clockwise around a hill, or as complex as desired, possibly only being available on a particular day, or to a particular kind of person. Some regiones are all but impossible to enter.

Finally, if a character gets lost near a regio boundary, he may accidentally enter the regio. Roll as normal, except that if the character does not have a relevant Ability this merely counts as zero.

At least one of these methods of entry must apply to any regio, at least if it is to have any impact on the game. There are some regiones into which you must be led by a native, and others into which you cannot be led, or enter voluntarily, but rather must get lost. Natives of a regio can almost always enter and leave freely, but even then there are exceptions. The most secure location possible for a covenant is a regio which people can only enter by being led, but getting into such a regio in the first place is very difficult.

<span id="magic-in-regiones"></span>
== Magic In Regiones ==

Supernatural powers or spells used in a regio level are affected just as in any other aura, determined by the Realm Interaction Table. Use the aura rating of the level occupied to modify spell

and other supernatural rolls. However, any power used within a regio of a realm different from that of the power attracts twice the normal number of botch dice.

<span id="the-origins-of-regiones"></span>
== The Origins of Regiones ==

Regiones arise in several ways, but two appear to be the most common. First, an inhabited aura might be surrounded by an aura of a different type, and slowly compressed. Sometimes, the aura simply disappears, but if the inhabitants are strong enough the besieged aura might move up into a regio, leaving a lower level aura in contact with the new aura. One or two Hermetic covenants have entered regiones in this way. When this happens the old contents of the aura are normally found on the new regio level, while the base level contains ruined and decaying versions of any buildings.

The other common route is through a spectacular and powerful event. Sometimes, instead of raising the prevailing aura, these events create a new regio level at a higher aura. This sort of event often duplicates all the mundane structures, and people may start scattered between the two new levels. Again, one or two Hermetic covenants have entered regiones in this way.

Hermetic magi would love to be able to create regiones at will, but they have yet to learn how. Attempts to create regiones through spectacular magical events have not succeeded reliably, and have often had very bad consequences.

<span id="vis-sources"></span>
== Vis Sources ==

aw vis (see page 212) can often be found in supernatural auras. Sometimes it is found in the bodies of creatures with Might, sometimes it is found in plants,

or rocks, or even in the breeze. Often, once the vis has been gathered, it does not get replaced naturally. Sometimes, however, it is possible to take a certain number of pawns of vis from a place every year. These places are known as vis sources, and they are among a covenant's most important assets.

A vis source can produce vis associated with any Art, but a single vis source normally produces a single kind of vis. Vis sources can also produce any amount of vis, although sources providing more than six pawns per year are rare. Some vis sources produce a varying number of pawns each year, but normally somewhere between one and ten.

The vis produced by a vis source needs to be gathered. Sometimes this is a simple matter. The vis

might be in the three golden acorns that appear on a tree, and all that is required is to pick those three acorns. Sometimes it is easy provided that you can detect vis. The vis might take the form of ordinary-looking leaves on the tree, so that you have to know which are vis to know which to pick. Finally, spells might be needed to gather the vis at all. For example, the vis might be in the breeze that blows through the branches of the tree at sunrise on the summer solstice.

<span id="sample-vis-sources"></span>
== Sample Vis Sources ==

* Golden acorns on a tree (Creo, Herbam, Terram)
* The bones of people buried in an old pagan graveyard, as long as they were buried within the last year. (Perdo, Corpus, Mentem)
* The first ice to form on a pond in winter. (Rego, Aquam)
* The chrysalis cases of butterflies in a magical forest. (Muto, Animal, Imaginem)
* The echoes of a shout in a particular valley at a particular time. (Intellego, Imaginem)
* The wind fanning a fire in a magical forest. (Auram, Ignem)
* Stones in strange shapes, found in a deep labyrinth of caves. (Imaginem, Terram, Vim)
* Crystals that diffract the light in dazzling and beautiful ways, growing on the peak of a mountain. (Ignem, Imaginem, Vim)
* Catkins that look like kittens in moonlight. (Animal)
* Dust that gathers over months on a cobweb in a particular location in the covenant. (Vim)

<span id="tainted-vis"></span>
=== Tainted Vis ===

Vis found in non-Magic auras may be tainted by its aura of origin. Faerie vis is generally safe for magi to use, although sometimes it may have strange side effects. It does not, however, tend to distort spells or have bad effects on the magi using it. More details can be found in ''Realms of Power: Faerie'', pages 18–19.

Divine vis makes most magi nervous. First, gathering it often has the potential to annoy the Church. Second, using it in magic seems somehow sacrilegious to many magi, who'd rather not invite Divine retribution.

Infernal vis is avoided by all sensible magi. It tends to twist any project to evil ends, and slowly corrupt a magus's personality as he works with it. At the very least, using Infernally tainted vis adds twice as many botch dice as usual to spellcasting, and requires a roll on the experimental results chart for an enchanted item. Magi should be very wary of discoveries made while working with Infernal vis. For information on just how bad it can get, see ''Realms of Power: The Infernal'', pages 18–19.

<span id="xiii-bestiary"></span>
== XIII. Bestiary ==

reatures in an Ars Magica game serve a variety of purposes. The simplest is something to fight, but this may not be the most

common. Most supernatural creatures are intelligent, and thus can be bargained with, talked to, or even come to the player characters for help. It's at least as interesting to have a dragon ask the characters to defeat a knight, as to have a knight ask the characters to defeat a dragon. It is best to think of creatures as characters in the game, rather than as obstacles to be overcome.

In most cases, the storyguide will want to create creatures that fit a particular role in his story, so this chapter provides a range of examples from the four realms, to help spark your inspiration. This doesn't even approach an exhaustive listing of possible creatures, and the creatures given here might well not exist in your game. Further creatures can be found in many of the supplements for Ars Magica, particularly the Realms of Power books and the regional sourcebooks.

Creature statistics are very similar to human statistics. The main differences are the Might Score, which determines the overall power of the creature and indicates the realm to which it is affiliated, and creature Powers, which work differently from supernatural abilities possessed by humans. Both of these differences are described below.

<span id="creature-might"></span>
== Creature Might ==

upernatural creatures have one of Divine Might, Infernal Might, Magic Might, and Faerie Might, depending on the realm to which they

belong. Might Score is very important, as it provides Magic Resistance, fuels the creature's powers, and determines the Penetration of those powers. The higher the Might Score, the more powerful the creature.

All powers have a Might cost, although sometimes it is zero. A creature that hasn't used any powers recently has a Might Pool equal to its Might Score. To use a power, it spends the appropriate number of points from the Might Pool. If the Might Pool doesn't have enough points in to use a power, the creature cannot use that power.

Might Pools almost always refresh to the creature's Might Score over the course of a day. Unless otherwise noted, the Pool refreshes at a constant rate, so that a creature with a Might Score of 25 regains a point in a little under an hour. If a creature's pool refreshes in a different manner, this is noted in the creature's description.

Creature Magic Resistance works against all forms of mystical power, just like Hermetic Magic Resistance. It is equally helpless against direct Divine miracles.

Creature Magic Resistance: Might Score + Aura Modifier

<span id="creature-powers"></span>
== Creature Powers ==

reature powers are not Hermetic spells, and thus are not bound by the restrictions of Hermetic magic. For a start, they do not have levels.

Instead, every power has a Might cost, which is deducted from the creature's Might Pool when the power is used. Further, creature powers need not use the standard Hermetic ranges, durations, and targets. Nevertheless, Hermetic spells are a good source of inspiration for creature powers, and 'like this spell, apart from...' is a very good way to describe a new power.

The format for a creature power is as follows:

Power Name, X points, Init Y, Form: Description.

The name is simply descriptive. X is the number of points the creature must spend from its Might Pool to use the power. Init is the Initiative modifier for the power, this determines when it is used in combat. The Form is the Hermetic Form that provides Magic Resistance against the power.

The description is everything else, what the power does, and the game mechanics, if necessary, for its effects.

The Penetration of a creature's powers depends on the creature's Might Score and on the number of points spent to use the power.

CREATURE POWER PENETRATION:

Might Score – (5 x Might Point cost of the power)

* Penetration Bonus

The Penetration Bonus is calculated in exactly the same way as for Hermetic magi (see page 219), so if the creature does not have the Penetration Ability, it is zero.

Some creature powers can be dispelled, if they have continuing effects. Their effective level is equal to the Might Score of

<span id="creature-format"></span>
== Creature Format ==

he format for a creature is very similar to the format for a character, and uses a lot of the same rules and values. In most cases, if a line does not apply,

it is omitted. Sometimes it is left in, with an explanation of why it does not apply, if that would be clearer.

(Realm) Might: The creature's Might Score. For mundane creatures, this line is omitted. The Form with which the creature is associated, for warding purposes, appears in brackets after the Might Score.

Characteristics: A list of the characteristics and values. Creatures with animal intelligence have a Cunning (Cun) score rather than an Intelligence score.

Size: The creature's size. Size 0 is the same size (volume, and thus normally roughly mass) as an adult human being. An increase or decrease of three points of Size is approximately equivalent to a factor of ten change in size.

Age: The creature's actual age, with the apparent age in brackets. (See Long Term Events, page 391, for aging rules and apparent age.) This is often irrelevant for creatures.

Decrepitude: The creature's number of Decrepitude points. These are gained from aging, and described on page 392. This is often irrelevant for creatures.

Warping Score: The creature's Warping Score, with the number of excess Warping Points in brackets. See Warping, on page 389, for more details. Creatures with Might do not have Warping Scores, as they are already part of a realm, but mundane creatures can have one.

Confidence Score: The creature's Confidence Score, with the number of Confidence Points in brackets. Important creatures, just like important characters, have Confidence.

Virtues and Flaws: All the creature's Virtues and Flaws, if it has any. These are all described in Virtues and Flaws, starting on page 61. If the creature has a Social Status, this comes first. Otherwise, the list starts with the Major Virtues, in alphabetical order, followed by Minor Virtues, alphabetically, Major Flaws, alphabetically, and Minor Flaws, also arranged in alphabetical order. A very few creatures do have The Gift, in which case it appears first, as normal. Only creatures with Magic Might can have The Gift, as it is an ability tied specifically to the Magic Realm.

Personality Traits: The creature's personality traits, and scores.

Reputations: Details of the creature's reputations, if any.

<span id="size-examples"></span>
=== Size Examples ===

Each Size category is approximately twice as heavy as the previous size category. A 1-point difference in Size doubles the weight, 2 points multiplies it by five, and a 3-point increase in Size entails a ten-fold increase in mass. Thus a pig weighs approximately the same as 50 hedgehogs, 200 rats or 2000 mice. Birds are two Size points bigger than their weight would suggest, accounting for their larger overall dimension; if you need to know the weight of a bird, subtract two from the Size before calculation. All heights and weights are approximate.

Combat: The combat statistics for modes of attack and weapons that the creature uses often.

Soak: The creature's Soak score.

Fatigue Levels: A listing of the creature's Fatigue levels and penalties, which represent how tired the creature is. A notation of 0/0 indicates that the creature has two Fatigue levels that impose no penalty, -1/-1/-1 indicates three Fatigue levels that impose a -1penalty. The penalty from Fatigue is always the penalty imposed by the least-tired remaining level, so a creature with three -1 Fatigue levels has a Fatigue penalty of -1 from when it loses its last 0 Fatigue level until it loses the third -1 Fatigue level. Fatigue is described on page 403. Not all creatures can tire.

Wound Penalties: Shows the penalties for wounds of varying severity, with the number of points of damage required to inflict a wound of that severity shown in brackets. Not all creatures can be wounded.

Abilities: All of the creature's Abilities, in alphabetical order. The format is Ability X (Y) (specialization), where X is the score in the Ability and (Y) is the number of experience points spent towards the next level.

'''Equipment''': The creature's stuff.

Encumbrance: The creature's Encumbrance, with the creature's Burden in brackets. The rules for Encumbrance are on page 403.

Powers: The creature's powers, in the format Power Name, X points, Init Y, Form: Description. (See previous page.)

Vis: The type, amount, and location of any vis in the creature. This is normally found in the corpse, rather than the living being.

== '''Oreating Oreatures''' ==

hen creating creatures for use in your own saga, you have a great deal of freedom. The first thing to remember is that, if during play you

realize that you have assigned the wrong numbers to some of the creature's statistics, you are allowed to change them during the game. Thus, you do not need to worry about getting the numbers exactly right, it's much more important to have the concept right, and have powers, Abilities, and Characteristics that do the right sort of thing.

The first step is coming up with a concept. The magical spirit that is the Rhine is very different from a faerie who mends shoes left out overnight, and different again from a demon who tempts people to blasphemy. An important part of the concept is the intended role with respect to the player characters. If the player characters are supposed to be able to defeat the creature in combat, you need to make sure its statistics are low enough. On the other hand, if the player characters are supposed to have no chance in a fight, you should make the statistics high.

Powers should be defined on the basis of what you think is interesting. If a power proves to be a problem, you can easily change it during play, so, again, you shouldn't worry too much. Creature powers can break the limits of magic, no matter what realm they are connected to, and you don't even have to explain to the other players how a particular power works. As long as you keep things interesting and fun, the players aren't likely to be worried about details anyway.

There are a few things worth bearing in mind when picking the numbers.

Might: Might Score is very important. A Might Score of 20 indicates that starting magi will have a lot of trouble affecting the creature with magic. A Might Score of 40 is enough to cause problems for a middle-aged magus, and a Might Score of 60 makes life difficult for even powerful magi. A Might Score of 75 renders the creature almost immune to Hermetic magic; casting totals over 75 are very rare indeed, even before subtracting the spell level.

A Might Score high enough to stop the player magi using spells that kill or inflict serious wounds is a good way to make sure that a climactic battle lasts more than a round, especially if combined with a good Soak score, or other strong combat abilities. A relatively high Might Score is also a good way to motivate the magi to gather Arcane Connections,

horoscopes, and images, so that they can boost their Penetration as high as possible.

Combat Statistics: If you do not intend the creature to get into a fight, you don't need to work these out in advance. If it is intended to fight, these need to be set by comparison with the player character combat statistics. In general, the creature should be a bit weaker than the force likely to attack it, if the grogs fight as a trained group, this means that the creature should be a lot more powerful than an individual grog.

Powers: The Might cost of a power is not determined primarily by how powerful the power is. Instead, it determines how good the power's Penetration is, and how often it can be used. As a rule, you will want greater powers to have lower Penetration and be usable less often, but that need not always be the case. A dragon that can breathe devastating fire as often as it likes (Might cost 0), but can only heal once or twice per day (Might cost 25), is a perfectly reasonable creature.

exaggerated for dramatic purposes. In Mythic Europe, it is not uncommon for beasts such as wolves to attack humans.

<span id="beasts-in-combat"></span>
== Beasts in Combat ==

Beasts fight much as humans do: they can use most combat options from the Obstacles chapter, including disengaging, (untrained) group combat, exertion, and non-lethal combat. Beasts are clever enough to use exertion and other combat options to their best advantage. Only a few beasts have the cooperative instincts to fight as a trained group. All others must use the untrained group rules.

Beasts with the Ferocity Virtue have Confidence Points, which may be spent in battle under certain circumstances.

Some beasts have more than one natural weapon. The best weapon is always listed first. Secondary weapons are less effective, but might be useful when the primary weapon is unavailable. For example, a bear usually relies on its claws, but might attack with its teeth while climbing with its claws after a victim. Regardless of how many weapons a beast has, it may only attack with one weapon in a given round.

Powers.

Venomous Bite: When the adder attacks, compare its Attack Advantage to the victim's armor Protection (not his Soak). If the adder's advantage is higher, the victim suffers the effects of adder venom as listed in the Poison Table on page 406, regardless of whether the bite inflicts an actual wound. The storyguide may adjust the required Attack Advantage for special circumstances: for instance, high boots might offer an effective Protection +3 against the adder's special attack even though they don't protect against normal attacks.

Natural Weapons:

Fangs: Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1.

Appearance: The common adder is a small snake, usually about a foot and a half in length. Its color varies from pale grey or yellow to red, with diamond-shaped black markings along its back. Some individuals are completely black. The adder's head is triangular in shape.

The adder is a venomous snake commonly found throughout Mythic Europe (except in Ireland). It is hardy enough to hibernate through the winter. It hunts rodents, lizards, and frogs by hiding and waiting for prey to pass nearby. Its venom is weak and can sicken, but not usually kill, a man.

The adder is prone to attack reflexively when anything stumbles across its hiding-place (see the Lightning Reflexes Virtue). Because it's so thin and flexible, it gains a +6 bonus to Defense against grapple attacks.

Natural Weapons:

Large Claws: Init 0, Atk +5, Def +3, Dam +4; Teeth: Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1. The bear's tough hide and thick fur combine to give it a Protection of +3.

Appearance: The bear is a large, shaggy beast that weighs up to fifty stone (700 pounds) and stands over seven feet tall on its hind legs. Its coat may be light brown or yellowish in color to black; most often, it is medium brown. The bear has large claws and makes a bellowing roar.

The only bear species that exists in Mythic Europe is known today as the brown bear. It can be found throughout Mythic Europe in forests, mountains, and even the northern tundra. Its range extends across North Africa and through Asia as well. It is most common in wilderness areas like the Pyrenees, the Alps, and Scandinavia and Russia.

The bear makes its lair in the earth, either in a cave or in a den it digs with its mighty claws. It lives mainly by foraging but can hunt and kill anything up to the size of a red deer. Men hunt the bear by setting deadfalls or chasing it with hounds. Few dare to engage it at close range with spears, for it is extremely powerful, and ferocious when wounded.

The brown bear can run quickly, gaining a +3 bonus to rolls involving running. It can stand on its hind legs so as to attack a man on horseback. It can climb trees and is a strong swimmer.

According to Pliny the Elder, the he-bear sleeps for forty days in winter and the she-bear sleeps for four months. The bear cub is born a shapeless lump of flesh until the she-bear licks it into the shape of a little bear.

'''Appearance:''' The wild boar has prominent tusks and a hairy ridge along its spine. It is densely covered in short bristles ranging in color from grey to black or brown. Its legs are longer than those of a domestic pig and it can run quickly for short distances.

The wild boar lives in forests throughout Mythic Europe, where it forages by night and rests by day. Wild swine travel in groups called sounders of twenty or more individuals, though they are also encountered singly.

In France and England the boar is called la bête noire, &quot;the black beast,&quot; for its evil temper. It is a favorite sport of noblemen, who hunt it from horseback using hounds, lances, and swords. According to Pliny the Elder, the wild boar toughens its hide by rubbing against trees.

Boars vary greatly in size, from eight stone (112 pounds) to more than thirty stone (420 pounds). The largest boars are Size +1.

'''Appearance:''' These statistics are for a bull of the Spanish type, which is black in color, weighs about eighty stone (1120 pounds), and has sharp, inward-curving horns and a hump on its back.

There are many breeds of cattle in Mythic Europe, some of them larger than this specimen. Most breeds in Mythic Europe are short and broad-bodied and have long horns. They may be black, white, tan, red, or brown in color. Some breeds have a coat of shaggy fur. Pliny the Elder writes of magical bulls that live in India, but the statistics here are for a mundane bull.

The bull does not attack without reason, but it is easily — sometimes accidentally — provoked. When a bull charges, it exerts itself to gain an Attack bonus and may simultaneously spend Confidence.

In Spain, the Moorish nobles make a spectacle of fighting bulls from horseback on festival days. The sport of bull-baiting, where spectators watch a tethered bull being killed by a pack of dogs, is known throughout Mythic Europe. Bulls are somewhat clumsy fighters at first, but if they survive combat they quickly grow &quot;wise&quot; and become very dangerous. The speed with which they learn to fight is reflected in their Affinity with Brawl.

'''Appearance:''' In Mythic Europe, domestic cats are shorthaired and tend to have grey or yellow-orange fur with darker stripes, though black, white, and calico cats are not uncommon.

The European wildcat looks much like a large domestic cat with a thicker, shaggier coat and bushy tail. Its coat is grey-brown with black stripes and a white underbelly.

The cat has a reputation for evil among the common folk. They accuse it of stealing the breath of babies, though only supernatural cats can do such a thing. Cats are sometimes tolerated because they keep down the population of rats, but they are not commonly kept as pets and they are often killed by peasants out of superstition or cruelty. For some reason, the cat's bad reputation is unknown in England and it is looked upon more favorably in that land. Pliny the Elder says nothing about the cat's reputation, noting only that the cat is the natural enemy of mice and that its eyes are so keen it can see in the dark.

Appearance: These statistics are for a gyrfalcon, the largest and most prized of falcons. Its wingspan can exceed four feet. It has a short, hooked beak and dark eyes. Its plumage may be white, grey, or dark brown and has a banded pattern.

The falcon is among the swiftest of birds and hunts on the wing, overtaking its prey in flight. Nobles use falcons to hunt game birds such as partridge. In the wild, the gyrfalcon can kill prey as large as a goose, and usually hunts birds and small rodents. It lives in cold northern lands including Scandinavia, Iceland, and Russia.

Natural Weapons: The weapon statistics for a courser's kick are Init +2, Atk +2, Def +2,

Appearance: The courser is a swift horse belonging to a mid-sized, athletic breed like the Andalusian. The Andalusian stallion is tall and strong, weighing about 80 stone (1120 pounds) and standing 15 hands (60 inches) high. It has a gracefully curving neck, a broad chest, straight back, and a flowing mane and tail. Its coat may be grey, black, chestnut, or roan.

The courser is a swift horse used by knights and nobles for hunting, traveling, and carrying important messages. The courser is not trained for battle and panics relatively easily; the statistics for its kick are given in case a character is unlucky enough to be next to a panic-stricken horse.

A light horse trained for battle is called a charger. To create a charger, replace the courser's Noncombatant Flaw with Proud (minor), change the Brave Personality Trait to zero, and give the animal a Brawl skill of 2 (hooves). Another kind of light horse is the palfrey, which is a riding horse chosen for its gentle gait and often ridden by inexperienced riders or by ladies. To convert a courser to a palfrey, reduce Quickness by two points and increase Dexterity by the same amount. Palfreys have the Noncombatant Flaw.

Any light horse — courser, charger, or palfrey — gets a +3 to rolls involving running or jumping.

'''Abilities:''' Athletics 5 (balancing), Brawl 3 (hooves) '''Natural Weapons:''' The weapon statistics for a

destrier's kick are Init +2, Atk +2, Def +2, Dam +1.

'''Appearance:''' The destrier is a heavy warhorse. One breed used as destriers is the Percheron, a huge horse weighing over 140 stone (1960 pounds) and standing over 16 hands (64 inches) high at the withers. It has a heavy, slightly curved neck, a broad and deep chest, and powerful, stocky legs. Its coat is either grey or black in color.

The destrier, or heavy war horse, has been bred in Mythic Europe since at least the time of Charles Martel (8th century A.D.). Some of the large horse breeds in Mythic Europe are the Percheron, the

Belgian, and the Friesian. These horses are used mainly for battle; farm work is done using oxen.

The destrier is almost always a stallion. It is highly trained so it will charge without fear when its rider commands. When pressed into melee, it can rear on its hind legs and lash out with its forehooves. Though huge, the destrier is agile and can balance on its hind legs for several combat rounds without difficulty. It is trained to fight independently of its rider, so it can help defend him if he should be dismounted or badly wounded.

Like all horses, the destrier is a fast runner and gains a +3 bonus to rolls involving speed. It is too heavy to be much of a jumper.

'''Natural Weapons:''' The weapon statistics for a dog's bite are Init 0, Atk +3, Def +1, Dam +1.

'''Appearance:''' These statistics are for a large hound such as the bloodhound. The bloodhound stands a little over two feet at the shoulder and weighs up to nine stone (126 pounds). It has large jowls, dangling ears, and a heavy tail. Its coat is short and may be tan, red, or liver in color.

There are many breeds of dogs in Mythic Europe, many of them similar to breeds that exist in our world (though they may be called by different names). The largest dogs are used for guarding livestock or hunting dangerous beasts like wolves, bears, and wild boars. They include the breeds like the bloodhound, elkhound, Rottweiler, mastiff, and great Dane. Smaller hounds, such as the greyhound, Basset hound, and Dalmatian, are Size –1 and are often used to hunt deer, fox, and small game. Medium-sized dogs (Size –2) include spaniels, used to chase small game and to flush game birds for falconers; terriers, which hunt badgers, stoats, and rats; and the Welsh corgi, a small cattle-herding dog. The smallest dogs (Size –3) include lap-dogs, small terriers bred for vermin control, and the tiny Italian greyhound. Several breeds that are popular in the real world, such as the German shepherd and most retrievers, did not exist in the Middle Ages. These statistics are for the bloodhound, and the Characteristics of other breeds may be different.

All dogs have a good sense of smell, and the bloodhound's sense is so keen it gets a +3 bonus to all related rolls. Dogs also get a +3 to endurance-related rolls due to their Long-Winded Virtue.

A pack of dogs may fight as a trained group under the leadership of a human Master of the Pack. Use the Master's Animal Handling score instead of his Leadership score to determine how many dogs he can command at a time.

It has a short, broad muzzle with powerful jaws and teeth. Its coat is tawny and the male lion has a dark, shaggy mane. The fearsome roar of the lion can be heard from a great distance.

Pliny the Elder writes that, during his time, lions were found in Europe only between the rivers Achelous and Mestus (in Greece), and that they also inhabited Syria and North Africa. The European lion was extinct before the middle ages in historical Europe, but might have survived in Mythic Europe. Pliny writes that there are two kinds of lions: those with long manes, which are bold; and those with curly manes, which are timid. These statistics are for the bold variety. Pliny also notes that the lion will not attack a man who lies prostrate before it.

The lion can make impressive leaps and gets +3 to jump-related rolls. It can easily leap high enough to attack a man on horseback.

Natural Weapons: During the autumn and winter, a stag has antlers with the following weapon statistics: Init +2, Atk +3, Def +2, Dam +3. In spring, it sheds its antlers and must fight with its hooves until the following autumn: Init +2, Atk +2, Def +2, Dam +1.

Appearance: These statistics are for the red deer, one of the largest deer in Mythic Europe. Adult males average 40 to 50 stone in weight (560 to 700 pounds) depending on the richness of the available food supply, and may be up to 15 hands high—as tall as some horses, but more lightly built. The red deer's coat is reddish-brown in winter and tan in summer, with a lighter rump and underbelly. Stags have a shaggy mane of dark fur and an impressive rack of antlers over four feet across from tip to tip. They make a deep, bellowing roar during the autumn mating season.

The red deer lives in open woodlands, moors, and grasslands throughout Mythic Europe. It avoids dense, tangled forests but can be found in alpine forests and meadows. The species is called &quot;elk&quot; in contemporary North America. The size of the red deer varies from +1 where grazing is poor to +2 where the grass is rich and plentiful. Does are smaller than stags and lack antlers.

The red deer is a favorite quarry of hunters. In some places, only nobles are allowed to hunt it. The stag usually flees from combat, trying to draw enemies away from its herd, but it can fight if it must. All deer gain a +3 bonus to rolls involving running or jumping.

Its color may be any shade from pale grey through dark brown, often with lighter patches on the sides of the face and around the eyes. The wolf can bark, but its better-known sound is its eerie, piercing howl.

The wolf is found throughout Mythic Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. According to Pliny the Elder, the wolves of northern regions are fierce while those of Africa and Egypt are weak

Wolves are greatly feared by commoners. They are hunted with large hounds because they kill livestock. In some lands, there is a bounty on their hides. Many tales attribute supernatural powers to wolves, but most wolves are mundane and have no powers at all.

The Flaws above reflect the medieval perception of the wolf as a wanton, bloodthirsty killer. Individual wolves, such as the Animal Companion of a player character, may substitute another Personality Flaw in place of the Compulsion. A wolf Animal Companion that goes around killing livestock could be disruptive to stories. Regardless of such a wolf's actual personality, mundanes are likely to treat it with a great deal of fear and suspicion.

The leader of a wolf pack has the additional Ability, Leadership 5 (wolves). A pack may fight as a trained group when its leader is present. A wolf pack is extremely dangerous.

== Creating Mundane Beasts ==

Shapeshifters of varying sorts create the need for a wide variety of statistics for mundane beasts. Although the animals listed in the previous section cover a wide range of the most popular options, there is no way to cover all the creatures that a magus might want to change into. This section provides detailed guidelines for creating any mundane beast, from the hedgehog heartbeast of Hérisson of House Bjornaer to a camel from the deserts of Arabia.

<span id="1-type-and-size"></span>
=== 1. Type and Size ===

There are four categories of beasts: Birds, Fish, Hoofed Beasts and Clawed Beasts. Birds are self-explanatory. Fish includes amphibians such as frogs, toads, and salamanders and reptiles such as snakes and lizards, as well as more traditional fish and whales. Hoofed Beasts includes both domestic animals and wild ones. The category of Clawed Beasts contains all creatures which do not fit into the other types.

<span id="2-characteristics"></span>
==== 2. Characteristics ====

As noted earlier, mundane beasts have a Characteristic called Cunning in place of an Intelligence score. Use Cunning for rolls that would otherwise call for Intelligence, such as finding a way out of a closed barn. Beasts have a limited capacity for problem-solving but they lack imagination, reason, and intelligence as such. Communication and Presence have slightly different meanings for animals. Presence represents how much impact that the creature has on its human viewers. Creatures with a low Presence are barely noticed, those with a high Presence instill awe, fear or wonder. Communication, as for humans, represents the ability of the animal to impart information; few animals (to the medieval mind) are capable of the transmission of complex thoughts to others. For beasts, the Quickness Characteristic has mainly to do with reflexes and agility, and little to do with movement rate. Many animals can run faster than a human, but that does not necessarily mean they should have better Initiative and Defense scores. Animals that run fast, but do not have especially good reflexes, have a Quality (see below) which reflects this.

Creatures of Non-Standard Size

You may wish to create creatures which are larger or smaller than the average for their type, or they may have been affected by Muto Animal spells. This is a simple procedure: for every point of Size removed, subtract two from Strength (and therefore Damage total), add one to Quickness (and therefore Initiative and Defense totals), and decrease the damage range for each wound level by 1 (minimum of 1). Note that the creature's mass has halved, at least. Increasing Size has exactly the opposite effect.

Unlike human characters, animals only spend points on their four physical characteristics (Stamina, Strength, Dexterity and Quickness). Like human characters, there are up to seven points to spend on increasing these characteristics. Negative points may also be taken to gain an equal number of positive points; but an animal cannot have more than two characteristics with negative values, and the minimum value is equal to (Size -5). There is no maximum characteristic score for an animal, and no Virtue or Flaw is needed for extreme characteristic scores for animals

After spending points on characteristics, make the following adjustments:

* Add twice the Size to Strength
* Subtract Size from Quickness

These adjustments may give an animal a third negative characteristic, or reduce a characteristic below the minimum of (Size -5).

The other four characteristics (Cunning, Perception, Presence and Communication) are given values according to the type of creature.

A creature may have the Minor Virtue Increased Characteristics one or more times (this is particularly appropriate for predators), just like a human character. The characteristic points gained from this Virtue may be applied to any of the physical Characteristics. These points should be spent before applying the adjustments for Size. See Step 3, below, for adjustments to this Virtue.

<span id="3-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
==== 3. Virtues and Flaws ====

Each species of beast has certain Virtues and Flaws that are common to all members of that species. Species Virtues and Flaws are not given for game balance reasons, but rather to provide rules for the unique strengths and qualities of beasts. When designing your own species, simply assign the Virtues and Flaws that describe the species the way you imagine it. It is recommended that a species have at least one point of Flaws for every three points of Virtues. All beasts get their species' Virtues and Flaws for free.

Exceptional beasts may also take individual Virtues or Flaws that set them apart from others of their kind. Any individual Virtues a beast takes must be balanced with individual Flaws, just as for human characters.

Personality Flaws are particularly appropriate for beasts; you may need to come up with new Flaws of this type, and creatures can have more than one.

SUITABLE VIRTUES AND FLAWS

Virtues: Berserk, Enduring Constitution, Ferocity, Improved Characteristics*, Lightning Reflexes, Long-Winded, Perfect Balance, Rapid Convalescence, Piercing Gaze, Reserves of Strength, Self-Confident, Tough Flaws: Clumsy, Fragile Constitution, Poor Eyesight, Poor Hearing, Fear, Noncombatant, Nocturnal, Reckless, Reclusive, Weakness; most Major Personality Flaws taken as Minor Flaws.

\* Improved Characteristics: large creatures require more characteristic points, because high value characteristics are increasingly more expensive. A creature of Size +1 or smaller gets 3 characteristic points from this Virtue as normal, a creature of Size +2 gets 6 characteristic points, a creature of size +3 gets 9 characteristic points, and so on.

<span id="4-basic-abilities"></span>
=== 4. Basic Abilities ===

All creatures have the following Abilities:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Түре
! ABILITIES
|-
| Clawed Beast
| Awareness 3 (food), Athletics 3 (running), Brawl 3 (bite or claw), Survival 3 (home terrain)

|-
| Fish
| Awareness 2 (food), Brawl 2 (dodging), Survival 3 (home terrain), Swim 5 (in home terrain)
|}

Qualities (see below) may add further Abilities to this list. Animals (at least, those with Cunning rather than Intelligence) cannot acquire experience points to improve their Abilities once they have reached adulthood, nor can they learn new Abilities. However, an intelligent being can provide a tamed beast with Teaching experience points using Animal Handling instead of Teaching; these points can be applied to current Abilities or conceivable new Abilities.

Unless modified by Qualities, all creatures have one Natural Weapon (usually either Teeth, Claws, or Hooves); and fur, feathers or scales which give them a Protection of 0.

A young animal may not have all of the Qualities that it will as an adult, and has reduced scores in most Abilities.

<span id="5-qualities"></span>
== 5. Qualities ==

Qualities are features of the animal that affect its game characteristics. Add any appropriate Qualities to the base creature from the following list, or make up your own. If any Quality grants an Ability that the creature already has, use the highest score, and choose whichever specialty seems most appropriate. Through Qualities, a creature may have one or more extra Fatigue levels. One extra Fatigue level grants an additional Winded level, two extra grant another Winded Level and another Weary Level, etc.

Accomplished Flyer: this bird is either a particularly powerful flier, or an acrobatic one. Athletics 5 (flying); the creature must be capable of flight.

Aggressive: add 1 to Cunning, Brawl 5 (natural weapons)

Ambush Predator: the beast lies in wait for its prey, and catches it by surprise. Stealth 4 (stalking prey), Hunt 4 (prey). Specialization for Brawl changes to one of the beast's natural weapons. If it has successfully crept up on its prey, it automatically wins Initiative in the first round of combat, and gains a +3 to its Attack total for the first round only.

Amphibious: Swim 4 (home terrain). Can hold breath for twice as long as normal.

Aquatic: Swim 5 (home terrain). Can breathe water.

Camouflage: +3 to all rolls to hide, whenever the creature is not moving.

Constriction: the creature has a long sinuous body or muscular tail, and can constrict an opponent whose Size is less than its own. Constriction is based on the grappling rules (page 398). The Attack Total is computed using the Brawl skill, and a constriction attack has the following weapon statistics: Init 0, Atk +3, Dfn 0, Dam n/a. As long as the creature maintains the grapple, its opponent is considered deprived of air (see page 407). The victim must make a Stamina check every 30 seconds (that is, every five rounds), or suffer the normal effects of deprivation. Once the creature has successfully grappled an opponent (and begun constricting), on subsequent rounds it can continue constricting and still attack with other weapons. These attacks may be directed at the grappled victim, or at another opponent.

Crafty: raise Cunning to 0 (if currently negative), or add 1. This Quality may be taken more than once for exceptionally cunning animals.

Crushing Jaws: although the creature is not particularly strong compared to humans, the muscles with which it bites down are tremendously powerful. The muscles which open its mouth are comparatively weak. A human may hold closed the creature's jaws with a successful Grapple. This Quality adds +3 Damage to any bite attack.

'''Defensive Fighter:''' the creature will fight, but only to defend itself. Brawl (dodging) 4, and an extra Fatigue Level

Domesticated: the beast loses any Survival Ability that it might have, but gains 1 point of Communication, if currently negative.

Extra Natural Weapons: gain an extra set of Natural Weapons, such as Horns/Antlers, Teeth/Tusks, Claws, or Hooves. Only one set of weapons may be used in each round of combat. This quality may be taken more than once.

Eyes of the Bat: the creature sees in much the same way as magi using the spell Eyes of the Bat.

Fast Runner: +3 to all rolls involving running.

Fast Flyer: +3 to all rolls involving speed while flying; the creature must be capable of flight.

Fins: no penalties to actions taken underwater.

Good Jumper: +3 to all rolls involving jumping.

Grapple: the creature may make a grapple attack instead of a normal attack. This attack may only be employed against an opponent which is less than or equal to (creature's Size + 1). See Non Lethal Combat (page 397) for rules on grappling. If the creature has another natural weapon (such as a bite), it may add its current Grapple Strength to its Attack Total in subsequent rounds, until the opponent breaks free. The creature must defend against any opponent outside the grapple with its Grapple Defense (see Natural Weapons Table, below).

'''Hardy:''' the creature is used to harsh conditions; it has Survival 5 (home terrain) and an extra Fatigue Level.

Herd Animal: the creature is brave when with others of its own kind. When forced to fight as a group, herd animals temporarily gain the Ferocity Virtue, which they may use to stampede or escape what is threatening them as a group. These animals do not have the Ferocity Virtue when caught on their own, unless taken as a Virtue. For example, a stag might have the Virtue, whereas the deer in his herd have this Quality.

Imposing Appearance: the creature has a beautiful, majestic or awe-inspiring appearance which appeals even to humans. Raise Presence to 0 (if negative), or increase by 1 otherwise. This Quality may be taken more than once for exceptionally beautiful or impressive creatures.

Keen Eyesight: add 1 to Perception, +3 to all rolls involving eyesight

Keen Sense of Smell: add 1 to Perception, +3 to all rolls using the sense of smell, +2 to all Hunt rolls.

Large Claws: the creature's claws are larger than average for a creature of its size. Use the weapon statistics for Large Claws listed below.

Large Horns/Antlers: the creature's horns or antlers are larger than average for a creature of its size. Use the weapon statistics for Large Horns listed below.

Large Teeth: the creature's teeth are larger than average for a creature of its size. Use the weapon statistics for Large Teeth listed below.

Loathsome Appearance: the creature is so repulsive that its Presence drops to –6. However, this should be treated as a Presence of +3 if the animal makes any attempt to scare or intimidate an opponent.

Mimicry: the creature is capable of mimicking other noises, such as a human voice. Raise Communication to 0 (if negative) or increase by 1. It does not understand the meaning of the

sounds it makes, unless the creature has Intelligence rather than Cunning, in which case the creature acquires Living Language 3. Note that a magus shapechanged into a creature with this quality cannot form the precise and complex sounds required for spell casting.

Overrun: this effect only applies if the creature has charged into combat, exerting itself for this attack. If the attack is successful, the opponent must make a Dexterity + Athletics stress roll against an Ease Factor equal to (Damage Total (before soak) + creature's Size – opponent's Size). If the roll fails, the opponent lands on the ground a number of feet away equal to the creature's Size, taking falling damage in the process. He must spend his next action regaining his feet, although the creature normally follows up with a trample. Prone characters cannot parry, but must use Brawl to defend themselves.

Pack Animal: these creatures may fight as a Trained Group when a Pack Leader is present. If the Pack Leader is not present, they may still fight as an Untrained Group.

Pack / Herd Leader: add 1 to Communication, Leadership 5 (own species).

Pursuit Predator: the beast actively hunts for its prey, either tracking it by scent or by chasing it down. Hunt 4 (prey), and an extra Fatigue Level. Specialization for Brawl changes to one of the beast's natural weapons.

Roll Attack: when the creature has successfully bitten a foe, it may roll in the following round. When the creature rolls, it either twists away a chunk of the flesh of its victim (doing +6 damage) or, if possible, drags its victim beneath the surface of the water. To prevent injury or submersion from a roll, the victim must treat this as a successful grappling attack with an Attack Advantage of 10. If a character is being drowned by the creature, the character may attempt to break free of the creature's jaws each round. This requires the character to overcome a successful Grapple attack with an Attack Advantage of 10.

'''Sharp Ears:''' add 1 to Perception, +3 to rolls involving hearing

Shell: the creature is encased in a protective shell. Grants a +4 to Protection, but the creature suffers a -3 to all rolls involving fast or nimble movement.

'''Skilled Climber:''' +3 to all rolls involving climbing.

Slippery: this creature has a +6 to Defense rolls against Grapple attacks. This Quality may be taken more than once; and the bonus rises by +3 each additional time it is taken.

Smell Water: the creature can smell drinkable water for a distance of up to two miles.

Spiny: the creature is covered in spines, these grant a +1 bonus to Protection. If any opponent

strikes at the Spiny creature with a bite, claw or fist attack, he inflicts damage as normal, but suffers +5 damage in return. Some creatures may poison their spines (see Venomous, below); in which case the attacker's own Attack Advantage is used against itself to determine the success of the Venom attack only.

Survive Without Water: the creature can survive without water for up to two weeks.

Swallow Whole: the creature can swallow whole any creature of Size 4 or more smaller than the creature itself. The victim can struggle to escape, but the confining nature of the gullet permits only Brawl attacks. It is impossible to breathe inside the creature, requiring deprivation rolls (page 407) even if the victim escapes the grapple. Three rounds after being swallowed, the victim reaches the stomach. The powerful acids inflict +9 damage every round, complete immersion quadruples this to +36 (page 407). A character may be able to brace himself and avoid complete immersion: make a Strength + Athletics roll each round: Ease Factor 6 results in only half immersion (triple damage), Ease Factor 9 results in immersion of a limb (double damage), and Ease Factor 12 means just a splash (normal damage). The creature cannot swallow a second creature until the previous one has reached the stomach.

Timid: subtract 1 from Presence, Stealth 4 (hiding), Awareness 4 (predators), usually lacks Natural Weapons.

Tireless: the creature gains two extra fatigue levels.

Thick Fur / Thick Scales: +1 to Protection; this Quality stacks with the Tough Virtue and the Tough Hide Quality.

Tough Hide: +2 to Protection; this Quality stacks with the Tough Virtue and the Thick Fur Quality.

Venomous: one of the creature's attacks (usually the bite) also delivers venom into the wound. Compare the Attack Advantage to the victim's Protection (not Soak). If the creature's advantage is higher, then the victim suffers the effect of the venom, regardless of whether the bite inflicts an actual wound. The venom can be of one of two strengths (chosen when Quality is taken) — the creature can choose from either: a venom that inflicts a Light Wound if a Stamina roll with an Ease Factor of 12 is failed; or one that inflicts a Medium Wound but has an Ease Factor of 9 to avoid the effects. This Quality may be taken more than once: each additional time increases the severity of the wound inflicted or adds three to the Ease Factor to avoid the effects.

Vocal: the creature can produce impressive vocalizations, such as a powerful roar or howl, beautiful birdsong or the like. Communication is raised to 0 (if negative) or increased by 1, gain Music 3. This Quality may be taken twice for particularly impressive vocal ability, increasing Music to 5.

All natural weapons use the Brawl Ability. Strength, Load and Cost are not applicable.

<span id="aging-1"></span>
== Aging ==

If an animal is to be an important part of a saga (as an Animal Companion, for example), its response to aging should be considered. There are three things to be considered: the age at which aging begins, the adjustment to the aging roll due to age, and the number of aging rolls per year. A human, with an average lifespan of 50 years (ignoring lifestyle modifiers), begins aging at 35, adds one to the aging roll for every 10 years, and makes 1 aging roll each year. The storyguide should decide upon the average lifespan of the creature and adjust these figures accordingly. Thus a creature with an average lifespan of 10 years has a modifier of (50/10) or five. It therefore begins aging at (35/5) or 7 years old, adds one to the aging roll for every (10/5), or two, years of age, and makes (1 x 5), or five, aging rolls each year. If more than one aging roll is made each year, they should be spread evenly throughout the four seasons, with any excess occurring in Winter.

When deciding upon the average lifespan of a creature, strict biological adherence is not necessary in Mythic Europe. Most small animals will have an average lifespan of under ten.

<span id="statistics-of-shapechangers"></span>
== Statistics of Shapechangers ==

The rules for creating mundane animals describe the process for producing the statistics for an average member of a particular species, but most player characters are not average humans, and so tend to have characteristics in animal form that differ from the species average. For Bjornaer magi and other shapeshifters, determine the statistics for the creature as described earlier, then follow these steps:

<span id="1-characteristics"></span>
==== 1. CHARACTERISTICS ====

For all Characteristics other than Intelligence/ Cunning:

* If the human and the animal Characteristic are both negative, use the lower of the two.
* If the human and the animal Characteristic are both positive, use the higher of the two.

Otherwise, add the two Characteristics together.

<span id="2-cunning-vs-intelligence"></span>
==== 2. Cunning vs. Intelligence ====

In most cases, the shapechanger retains human Intelligence. However, lycanthropes lose Intelligence, replaced by Cunning, and other transformations, particularly curses, may have the same effect.

Example of Characteristics, Cunning, and Intelligence:

<span id="ulf-magus"></span>
==== ULF (MAGUS) ====

Int +2, Per -1, Pre +2, Com 0, Str -1, Sta +1, Dex +1, Qik +1 Wolf: Cun +1, Per +2, Pre 0, Com +1, Str -1, Sta +3, Dex +2, Qik +1 Ulf in Heartbeast form: Int +2 (human value)

Per +1 (sum of human -1 and wolf +2)

Pre +2 (sum of human +2 and wolf 0) Com +1 (sum of human 0 and wolf +1)

Str –1 (lowest of human –1 and wolf –1)

Sta +3 (highest of human +1 and wolf +3)

Dex +2 (highest of human +1 and wolf +2)

Qik +1 (highest of human +1 and wolf +1)

<span id="3-size"></span>
==== 3. SIZE ====

Human Size has no impact on the Size statistic of the shapechanged form. However, if the animal form is within the size range of most animals (Size –4 to Size 0) and the character has a Virtue or Flaw that affects Size, then she will be a notably large or small member of her species.

<span id="4-virtues--flaws"></span>
==== 4. VIRTUES &amp; FLAWS ====

Apply all the Virtues and Flaws of the animal form while shapechanged, as well as all Virtues and Flaws of the human form, if applicable. For example, a Lame character is still Lame as an animal. If the animal form already has a Virtue or Flaw possessed by the character, it applies only once.

<span id="5-general-abilities"></span>
==== 5. GENERAL ABILITIES ====

Use the General Abilities of the animal form. The General Abilities of the animal form are not suitable for human bodies, and cannot be taught to human characters. None of the human General Abilities can be accessed other than languages (which can still be understood) and lores. Arcane and Academic Abilities are available to the shapechanger if he retains Intelligence. Supernatural Abilities can always be used.

<span id="6-communicating"></span>
==== 6. COMMUNICATING ====

Acquire the ability to communicate with members of the same or similar species as the shapechanged form. Animals of the same temperament and aspect, which also share the same diet and habitat, can be considered to speak dialects of the same language. Thus, it can be assumed that all eagles, hawks, and buzzards share a common language, but this differs from the shared language of the swans, storks, and herons, and also from the language spoken by songbirds.

<span id="7-wounds--experience"></span>
==== 7. Wounds &amp; Experience ====

Any wounds taken in the human form are reflected in the animal form, and vice versa. Thus, a human with a Medium Wound has a Medium Wound in cat form, despite the fact that if that wound had been inflicted when in cat form, it would have been more serious due to the different wound ranges of a cat and a human. Lycanthropes are an exception to this — when transforming back into human form, all wounds taken while an animal are healed, although wounds suffered as a human remain.

A character who spends a substantial amount of time in animal form may apply any experience gained for that period (either through adventuring, exposure, or practice) to the Abilities of her animal form.

<span id="6-combat-statistics"></span>
=== 6. Combat Statistics ===

Combat Statistics are calculated as normal (page 393), using the Natural Weapons Table. Because combat totals are affected by Characteristics, these weapons may be used for creatures of all sizes; a mouse and a cat have the same basic statistics for their bite attack, but the combat totals are very different.

The Free Virtue Jinn marks out a category of spirits associated with the Islamic lands. They are all vulnerable to the magic of the Sahirs (see The Cradle and the Crescent, Chapter 3), and may be part of the Magic, Faerie, or Infernal realms. See The Cradle and the Crescent, Chapter 4, for more information.

Donning the Corporeal Veil, 2 points, Init +1, Corpus: Baghl can form the physical body described under Appearance to house his spiritual form, when doing so he acquires the physical characteristics, size, combat statistics, and Wound levels listed earlier. His arms and armor are also created with this power. He cannot become fatigued. This body lasts until he decides he no longer needs it. Killing the body does not kill Baghl.

Presence, 0 points, constant, Mentem: Baghl is aware of everything that goes on within his haunt. This power needs to Penetrate to perceive beings with a Magic Resistance.

Vis: 1 pawn of Terram vis can be collected every year from his haunt, in the form of a quartz-encrusted stalactite at the back of his cave. If slain in physical form, his body yields 3 pawns of Terram

Appearance: Baghl is the jinni of a dark cave found in the Elbruz mountains that was once used as a quarry until he drove off the miners. He may be appeased mainly by being left alone to enjoy his beautiful cave formations, although he sometimes agrees to converse with theological scholars. He appears as an obese man with a mule's head, pupilless eyes of jetblack stone, and quartz-veined limbs that heft an oversized maul. In physical form he can also assume the shape of a large black mule.

&quot;If anyone is ill, the caladrius will tell whether the patient will live or die.&quot;

— Pierre de Beauvais

A caladrius is a mystical bird much sought by royal households. It can determine whether a sick person will live or die. If the patient is to die, the caladrius sadly turns away from him, but if he is to live, it gazes deeply into his eyes, drawing the sickness into itself. It then flies away toward the sun, going so high that the sun's rays burn away the disease (but they do not harm the caladrius itself).

A caladrius will not absorb a terminal illness (its Lesser Immunity would not protect it), but it will gladly heal any lesser ailment. It can heal either spontaneous diseases, which result from aging crises or diseases due to an external cause. As long as the crisis is not terminal or the disease does not cause a Lethal Wound, a caladrius can cure it. It can only heal wounds caused by disease, not those resulting from poison, combat, or other causes. It cannot remove Decrepitude.

<span id="story-seed-the-imprisoned-caladrius"></span>
== Story Seed: The Imprisoned Caladrius ==

Both kings and magi greatly prize the caladrius for its healing powers. Such a powerful character has captured a caladrius and plans to keep it until his next aging crisis. The kind-hearted bird wants only to be set free so it can use its healing power to help others. Perhaps it finds a way to ask the characters for help, or maybe it escapes on its own and the characters are accused of stealing it.

<span id="essential-traits"></span>
=== '''Essential''' Traits ===

Essential traits are possessed by some creatures affected by the Magic Realm, and indicate features of their being that are part of their essential nature. Magic cannot, therefore, make them act against those traits. They are indicated with an asterisk in the character statistics; for more details, see Realms of Power: Magic, page 54.

<span id="daimons"></span>
== Daimons ==

Daimons are ancient, named, individual spirits that dwell in the depths of the Magic Realm. They are the spirits of heroes and of ancient pagan deities, or the powerful spirits of sacred groves. Unlike simpler spirits, a Daimon can manifest in several places simultaneously, projecting only an Aspect of itself.

A Daimon is a permanent resident of the Magic Realm and cannot enter the material world; instead, it creates an Aspect as its agent on Earth. An Aspect may be created or destroyed with a moment's thought, and costs no Might points to create. Each Aspect is like an independent spirit, with some or all of the characteristics and powers of the original spirit, but its own Might score (less than or equal to that of the parent Daimon), and its own pool of Might points. An Aspect cannot recover spent Might points, rather it is dispelled when exhausted and replaced (if necessary) with another Aspect. Aspects that can take physical damage are incapable of healing, but can be replaced when they die. An Aspect that loses all its Might Points or takes an Incapacitating wound, or loses consciousness for any reason, disappears, returning to the Daimon. Defeating or destroying the Aspect has no impact on the originating Daimon, except perhaps on its disposition towards the perpetrators of these acts. No permanent changes can be made to any Aspect, as they never last. Only the Aspect is ever trapped or bound by magic, and the Daimon can escape by discarding the Aspect. An Aspect cannot appear within several miles of another Aspect of the same Daimon, and no Aspect can return to the same location (as defined by the storyguide) within a day of leaving it. Not all Aspects created by the same Daimon need be identical; designed for different functions, they might have different powers and Mights. (See &quot;The Twilight of the Gods&quot; in Dies Irae for an example.)

An Aspect is a constant Arcane Connection of indefinite duration which is in constant mental contact with its Daimon. In theory, an Aspect could be used to target spells of Arcane Connection Range against its parent Daimon, but the need to cross the boundary between realms to the Magic Realm makes this a difficult proposition. ''Realms of Power: Magic'' contains more detail on the Magic Realm and the magic needed to deal with it.

As Daimons only ever send Aspects out of the Magic Realm, you do not need to decide on statistics for a Daimon unless the characters travel

to the Magic Realm to find and confront it. If those statistics are needed, a Daimon has all powers possessed by any of its Aspects, and may have more, and has a Might at least equal to the highest Might of any of its Aspects. Its Might Score may be higher, but should still be no higher than 100. As a guideline, the Daimon itself should have a Might of at least 50, even if its Aspects have Might Scores of 10 or 15. In theory, a Daimon could have a single Aspect, and have exactly the same statistics as that Aspect, but it would still be fundamentally different from a simple magical spirit with the same statistics, as the Daimon can manifest multiple Aspects at the same time.

Hermetic magi do not understand Daimons very well, and many of the best informed are in Mystery Cults (as described in ''The Mysteries Revised Edition'', Chapter 9), and thus not inclined to share what they do know. This obscurity is compounded by the fact that, in 1220, Hermetic magi have a very poor understanding of the Magic Realm, and to the best of the Order's knowledge no magus has ever encountered a Daimon on its home territory.

Summoning Aspects of Daimons is typically difficult, and based on remnants of non-Hermetic magic. Ordinary Hermetic magic cannot summon an Aspect of a Daimon from the Magic Realm; a maga must know the mysteries of theurgy to achieve this (see The Mysteries Revised Edition, Chapter 9). It involves long invocations, typically in praise of the spirit to be summoned, and invoking and imploring other spirits, and as such the Church would frown most heavily upon it. St. Augustine in The City of God distinguishes between dulia, or praise and honor accorded to a man or power in accordance with their proper dignity, such as the veneration due to a saint, and latria, praise and honor which should only be accorded to God. Magi who deal with spirits and adjure them by name are often accused of surpassing dulia, and straying into worship of these Daimons, a terrible sin.

An Aspect that has been summoned can be affected by magic just like any other spirit, and can even be controlled or bound, with the caveat that the Daimon can simply dissolve the Aspect and send a new one to escape the binding.

This section includes game statistics for a few sample Aspects of Daimons. Storyguides may design others using their knowledge of mythology and the needs of their saga.

<span id="true-names-and-synthemata"></span>
== True Names and Synthemata ==

A True Name is a secret name that is an expression of the spiritual essence of an entity; a special formula of strange incantations and gestures that takes only a few moments to recite, but is difficult to learn. A True Name is an Arcane Connection of indefinite duration, and is often the only Arcane Connections possible to a Daimon. Only creatures with a Might score have a True Name, but not all creatures with a Might score do. All demons, angels, jinn, and Daimons have a True Name, as do other intelligent entities with a unique personality; the storyguide is the ultimate arbiter as to which creatures have a True Name and which do not. Each True Name is a spelllike ability recorded as &quot;True Name of (Being)&quot; on the character sheet, and costs 5 experience points to learn. These points can come from Practice, Exposure, or Adventure; or from an Advancement Total dedicated to the appropriate (Realm) Lore. You receive one free experience point in the (Realm) Lore whenever the character learns a True Name completely.

The True Name of a Daimon is also an indefinite duration Arcane Connection to all of its Aspects, although a magus needs to specify which Aspect a spell is intended to target. If the Arcane Connection is being used to increase the Penetration of a spell that is being targeted by other means, the target is already specified, but this may be more difficult for a spell at Arcane Connection range.

Synthemata are signs, symbols, or passwords that link a magician to a supernatural creature; any being with a Might score has synthemata, regardless of whether they also have a True Name. Theurgic spells include these magical words in the formula of incantation; while granting no actual power, they are necessary for the correct operation of this magic, and remain a secret of the craft. Some magi and hedge wizards have the ability to work the correct synthemata into their magic as an intense and powerful channel to a spirit, so that they may command them through this channel. Virtues to work such magic are described in The Mysteries Revised Edition, pages 86–88. Knowing the True Name of a creature adds 5 to all lab totals to research synthemata for that same being.

He can only do this once per person, and can only to a maximum of +3. Increasing Presence this way is a very useful aid to the aspiring Mystagogue.

Vis: 7 Rego

A hero in German poetry and song, Dietrich was the boy-king of Bern after the fall of Rome. During his reign, several great Nibelungen heroes, including Siegfried himself, were loyal members of his court. When his uncle Ermenrik, German ruler of Rome, conquered Bern, Dietrich fled to the court of Attila the Hun, where he went on many

adventures and became one of the greatest warriors in history. He returned after his uncle died, retook Bern and captured Rome. He died in a quest for revenge against a friend who betraved him. and was buried in an ornate tomb in the Lessini Mountains, where the Alps cross over into Italy. His tomb is a treasure trove of weapons and armor, enchanted by being dipped in the blood of a great dragon Dietrich slew.

When anyone enters the tomb, however, the Daimon of Dietrich animates his hulking corpse. If you come seeking wisdom and prove yourself worthy, he will dispense kingly advice. If you come seeking power, you will face one of the greatest warriors on Earth, even in death. Another legend propagated by the Church says Dietrich, a heretic suspected of Arianism, was thrown into the volcanic Mount Etna. The legend of Dietrich appears in Das Heldenbuch (&quot;The Book of Heroes&quot;) a collection of German romances published in the early 13th century, organizing the tales of the Ostrogoths and Franconians into two epic cycles.

Vis: 2 Ignem, 1 Rego

First summoned by Baltic wizards, this Daimon takes the form of a small dragon of fire that dwells

hearth or a fireplace. It enjoys napping amongst burning logs and coals, coiling its long-snake like body beneath the flames to conceal its presence. It will leave gifts for the master of the household, possibly stolen from somewhere else, and will attack strangers if they act destructively. If it is treated poorly, it will cause mischief before departing. The magus Andrilikes, a theurgist of the Novgorod tribunal, wrote a Hermetic ritual for summoning this lesser Daimon to his sanctum, and has given copies to several of his friends.

<span id="clementals"></span>
== '''Clementals''' ==

Elementals are magical creatures composed of very pure elemental matter. They are not truly alive, and are capable of neither growth nor reproduction. Instead, they form from pure physical matter under some magical impetus, such as a Magic aura. Nothing that is or has been alive can generate an elemental, nor can matter that is no longer in a raw state, but which has been moved, cut, or otherwise interfered with by a living being.

The process of forming an elemental is called rarefication. This process causes atoms of matter to take on a pseudo-life of their own, freeing themselves from the atoms of other elements and self-organizing into an elemental. Usually only one elemental forms, of a maximum size determined by the amount of matter present. Magi of the Order know spells that can catalyze this process, but they may also create elementals by accident with careless use of elemental magic (see below for more details). Further, raw elemental matter possessing a Warping Score of 5 may spontaneously rarefy into an elemental; for example, a natural spring within a Magic aura of 6 might generate a water elemental after 75 years. However, not all Warped matter develops an elemental, and this process is little understood even by those who have studied it.

Once rarefied, the elemental exists until it is destroyed; elementals do not age, have no need for nutrition, and do not succumb to disease. They suffer from impulses that drive them to certain actions based on their elemental make-up, but they possess no capacity for thought in the traditional sense.

<span id="clementals-and-might"></span>
=== Clementals and Might ===

An elemental does not replenish its Might Pool every day, but instead only recovers Might Points when resting in a Magic aura of no less than (its Might Score / 5), and at an extremely slow rate. It takes the character an entire season to recover all of its spent Might in this way, though like other magic creatures it can still regain Might Points immediately by consuming vis: 5 Might Points for every pawn of vis associated with the same Form as its Might, or 2 Might Points for every pawn of vis associated with any other Art.

<span id="size-might-and-characteristics-of-elementals"></span>
=== Size, Might, and Characteristics of Elementals ===

The Size of an elemental is dependent on the Might chosen for it, and the Might of an elemental also determines its typical Characteristics. The table below indicates values for the eight Characteristics at different Might scores.

Some magi who are skilled in elemental magic routinely create and bind elementals to their bidding, but the primitive sentience of these beings, combined with the difficulty in obtaining the appropriate raw materials and vis required, means that most do not bother. Ritual Creo spells can create elementals, and they may be controlled using Rego magic. In addition, standard Rego guidelines may also create wards (or prisons) for elementals with spells that affect creatures from the Magic Realm, and Perdo Vim spells can destroy the Magic Might that animates their simple bodies.

Other spells involving the elemental Forms may accidentally cause an elemental to rarefy, if cast on sufficiently pure matter that is already substantially Warped, such as that found within a Magic aura. The production of an elemental is a potential consequence of any botched spell or lab activity involving an elemental Form while in a Magic aura. Similarly, magic used to purify an element can have a similar effect — more than one Flambeau magus has tried to make his flames hotter, and accidentally rarefied a fire elemental.

Elementals are not living, thus they cannot suffer wounds, instead, each blow separates some of their substance from their animating force. In practice, this works the same as inflicting wounds on a living creature, but each wound also reduces the elemental's Might Pool by a number of points equal to the Wound Penalty. An Incapacitating Wound removes 5 Might points, just like a Heavy Wound. The elemental's Might score does not change, so there is no need to recalculate Size following a wound.

== A Digression into Physics ==

The universe is made up of building blocks called atoms (from atomas, meaning &quot;uncuttable&quot;). There are four varieties of atoms, and each atom possesses two qualities that govern its nature: earth is cold and dry; water is cold and moist; air is hot and moist; and fire is hot and dry. The corpuscles of atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter, and have size, shape, and color. Corpuscles of earth are cubes, those of water are icosahedrons (shaped like a 20-sided die), air corpuscles are octahedrons (an eight-sided die), and fire corpuscles are tetrahedrons (a four-sided die or pyramid). The size of the corpuscles determine the type of matter that it forms. Small tetrahedral corpuscles make up the fine blue fire that gives the sky its color; whereas large smoky flames are made from the largest corpuscles of fire. Air that is thin and pure is formed from small octahedra; whereas mist is made from large, dense octahedra. Oil receives its thickness from its large corpuscles of water; but very fine atoms make up volatile liquids like spirit of wine. Rock is made of large and heavy corpuscles; whereas sand is made of much finer cubes.

The moist quality causes a thing to adapt to its external conditions, whereas dryness causes a thing to define its own shape and bounds. As a consequence, moist things tend to be volatile and expansive, since they can fill spaces in their surroundings, whereas dry things are fixed and structured. Hotness causes matter to separate and seek those of its own kind, but coldness promotes mixing of matter and coagulation. The world is formed of four regions of elemental matter, with the self-defining dry elements forming the innermost layer of earth and the outermost layer of fire. The two cold elements sink to the center of the earth whereas the two hot ones seek to separate and rise, leaving the final order, from the center, as earth, water, air, and fire. Beyond the region of fire is the Lunar Sphere, which separates the material and the celestial realms. More details on this issue can be found in Art &amp; Academe.

== Story Seeds: The Forgotten Child ==

A magus uses Incantation of Lightning (or a similar spell of 6th magnitude or greater) in a Magic aura, which inflicts the last Warping point needed to rarefy an elemental. Unaware of what he's done, he moves on. The elemental he has unwittingly created causes no end of trouble for the locals. Eventually the magus discovers his error, and must put right what he has wrought.

<span id="the-unforgiving-sea"></span>
== The Unforgiving Sea ==

Concerned that a colleague has not been heard from for a while, the player magi are dispatched to see if anything is wrong. The magus — an expert in Aquam — discovered a way to increase the Might (and size) of his pet water elemental, using raw Aquam vis that he transferred into a sufficient quantity of pure elemental matter. The infused water was then absorbed by the elemental as the magus cast a Creo Aguam spell (with a Vim requisite) of his own devising. Unfortunately for the magus, the elemental became too powerful for him to control, and he is now trapped in his sanctum. Alternatively, the characters may just come across his shattered laboratory and his lab texts, and not realize the danger involved in recreating his work.

<span id="lunchtime-in-the-vis-stores"></span>
== Lunchtime in the Vis Stores ==

The characters discover some Terram vis in a patch of clay lying in a region with no mystical aura. They take it home to their covenant and put it in their vis stores. Now that it is in a Magic aura, the elemental can start to recover its exhausted Might pool, and it consumes the magi's other Terram vis to make itself larger. When the characters next visit their vis stores, they are in for a surprise.

An elemental that is reduced to a Might Pool of zero loses its animating force and becomes inanimate. In this state it can easily be mistaken for raw vis. As soon as the elemental regenerates a point of Might pool it can move again, but since elementals do not naturally regenerate Might, they have difficulty recovering it. An elemental could remain dormant for many years before the presence of the correct flavor of vis brings it back to pseudo-life.

The pieces of the elemental's body broken off during physical combat contain vis. Each time the character is wounded, part of its body is separated from the rest, and these pieces contain some of the elemental's vis, a number of pawns equal to ((total Wound penalty /5) – the number of pawns already lost). For example, a Light wound would separate a pawn of vis from the character, and produce another pawn after five more Light wounds. This vis is easily collected for water and earth elementals, less so for air and fire elementals. This vis can be used by a magus to power spells before the elemental is destroyed, although it is often difficult to collect it in the middle of a fight. In addition, the elemental instinctively tries to reunite its matter with itself, and may well manage to re-absorb the vis and replenish its Might pool. If an elemental is damaged by destroying its matter — using Perdo (Form) or Perdo Vim spells, or water against a fire elemental, for example — then the vis is also destroyed.

<span id="clemental-powers"></span>
==== Clemental Powers ====

All elementals have a power that results from the elemental matter from which their bodies are made, and a power that describes their natural method of attack. Magic Resistance can prevent the elemental from touching its opponent, but the elemental does not need to spend Might points for this attack, meaning that its Penetration for this is typically equal to its Might. Most elementals have at least one other power. This power should be strongly tied to the type and origin of the magical entity. Typical powers are listed with the descriptions of the elementals.

The earth elementals are known to the Order as genomi (singular genomus, meaning &quot;earth-living&quot;), but they go by a number of other names including gnomes (contracted from their Hermetic name), pygmaei, and telluri. They may be rarefied from any large concretion of earth that has not been worked by human hands, such as untilled soil, natural rock features, and naturally occurring nuggets of metal. It is no harder to rarefy a genomus from soil than it is from metal, but the quantity of raw material available limits the size of the elemental created — a gold nugget of Size -10 can only produce an elemental with Might 3. Genomi are extraordinarily long-lived, and are as durable as the substance from which they are formed. They are patient predators, driven by an unslakable thirst to extract the delicious moisture from living beings. They are fiercely

territorial, and will attack any being who intrudes upon their defined space; thus genomi make excellent guards — most attacks from a genomus result from having stood upon one!

An earth elemental appears much like any other object of earth or rock, except it is made up of sharp edges and right-angled corners that form cubic corpuscles of different sizes. Earth elementals move by sliding these cubic components around in endless cycles; this appears awkward and laborious in hard-bodied genomi, but can be hypnotically smooth in those made of sand or soil. Genomi are exceptionally strong and remarkably fast. An earth elemental made from a hard substance attacks by bludgeoning its prey with its stone limbs. Softer genomi of sand and soil will engulf their prey first by making a grapple attack, and then crush the immobilized target within their bodies.

The elemental's body is composed entirely of soil, sand, or rock. It can match a walking man for speed, and overtake a running horse when tumbling downhill. Only bludgeoning weapons such as hammers, maces, or axes can damage an earth elemental; piercing or slashing weapons merely plunge into the body of a soil elemental or glance off the surface of a rock elemental. Spades and picks are also effective weapons.

All earth elementals have the following power:

Crush, 0 points, Init equal to (Qik-2), Terram R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

The elemental clubs at an opponent with its heavy limbs, requiring a normal Bludgeon melee attack, which does its own damage as normal. If the elemental is at least equal in Size to its opponent, a successful Crush attack can pin him to the ground, and the elemental adds its (Might/5, rounded up) to its Grapple Strength to prevent its victim escaping. If the elemental successfully grapples, then any equipment carried by its victim is damaged; fragile items are destroyed, robust items are broken (and are destroyed if affected again by this power), and metal items are damaged (and are broken if affected again by this power) Re(Pe)Te 30 (Base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 affect stone, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect)

Some earth elementals have the following powers. Other powers typically mimic Terram spells, particularly Rego Terram spells.

The Red Touch, 1 point, Init equal to (Qik + 5), Terram R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind

The touch of the elemental can rust metal; every time it is struck in combat by a metal object, or successfully strikes a being with metal armor, it can convert that metal into a thoroughly rusted object that will crumble to dust.

Water Clementals

The lymphae (&quot;pure waters&quot;) are also called undines, undena, or ondines (all from Latin unda, meaning &quot;fluid, wave&quot;), as well as aquacolae (&quot;water dwellers&quot;), nymphs (a term also applied to certain faeries), and alcyones. Only naturally occurring liquids can produce elementals, typically of salt or fresh water. Water that has been separated from its source cannot be rarefied into a lympha, nor can liquid extracted from its source by human effort. Lymphae in a relaxed state sink into a thin film or puddle, perhaps even soaking into the ground. They can pull themselves up into symmetrical humps faceted with triangular units — their corpuscles are naturally icosahedral. The fluid that makes them is always of the utmost purity, often crystal clear and sparkling.

Lymphae have the best capacity for learning and understanding of all elementals, and are remarkably resilient to damage. However, their slow and languorous movements make them unsuitable as protectors. They are driven by their nature to collect and mix substances together, and their homes are often the site of eclectic collections of garbage that they have gathered. They commonly attack by pulling their opponents down to the ground and then smothering them, separating and recombining their possessions with an obsessive interest.

A water elemental's body is composed entirely of water. It can roll across the ground, either slowly if derived from a body of still water, or as fast as the current if from a river or stream. The elemental's speed is halved if moving up even a gentle incline. Most weapons are meaningless to a

Drown, 0 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Aquam R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind After successful melee attack, the elemental can engulf a target whose Size is smaller than its own and attempt to drown him, necessitating a roll to avoid deprivation. The victim can attempt to escape from its clutches each round using the Grappling rules. ReAq(Co) 30 (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite, +1 constant effect)

Some water elementals have the following powers. Other powers typically mimic Aquam spells, particularly Rego Aquam spells.

Chill Touch, 2 points, Init equal to (Qik + 4), Ignem R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind The lympha's touch extracts heat from a target, inflicting +10 damage. This damage is Soaked without the benefit of armor, as the watery body of the elemental seeps through all protection. Pelg 15 (Base 10, +1 Touch)

Sight of the River, 2 points, Init equal to (Qik – 1), Imaginem R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Room The elemental can view any location to which it has an unbroken connection of water, regardless of the distance involved. Thus, it may see anyone on the same river, touching the opposite shores of its sea, or even standing on the same earth through the water that makes soil damp. Someone standing on a stone or wood surface would be invisible to it, however. Anyone who can share senses with the elemental can see what it sees. InIm 20 (Base 1, +4 Arcane, +1 Conc, +2 Room)

lympha — blades and piercing weapons simply pass straight through, although bludgeoning weapons can still harm them. A water elemental's attacks only inflict Scuffle damage, and it often attempts to disarm, trip, or grab worn items with its Attack Advantage rather than inflict damage. A source of fire that does damage less than the elemental's Might is extinguished on contact, while more-powerful flames will evaporate the elemental's body, inflicting &quot;wounds&quot; as normal. Successful fire attacks destroy any Aquam vis that might have been present in the evaporated matter.

<span id="air-clementals"></span>
== Air Clementals ==

Zephyrus is the name given to an air elemental by members of the Order of Hermes, but they are also known as silvestres, sylphs, aeoliae (wind elementals), nenuphas (cloud elementals), and brontes (thunder and lightning elementals). Any air under the open sky or any natural weather phenomenon can produce a zephyrus. A zephyrus is composed of chains of octahedral corpuscles: in wind elementals, these chains form ropes; cloud elementals consist of interlocked loops; and a lightning elemental is a branched chain of scintillating energy.

Zephyri are utterly restless — they cannot remain still, even for a moment. They are travelers, moving through the world beneath the sky unless constrained by magic. They rarely descend from their lofty heights, but are occasionally curious about what is going on below them. They are highly perceptive, and are aware of everything going on around their home. They can sense the slightest movement of air from any direction, and are impossible to catch by surprise. They crave the disintegration of rigidity and barriers, and many are capable of dissolving structured matter.

A zephyrus' body is composed entirely of air. It is capable of moving through landscape unobstructed by other objects in its way, and can enter any space that is not air-tight. The speed of movement varies by elemental type: a mist elemental can roll at walking pace, whereas a lightning elemental is literally lightning fast. Weapons are meaningless to a creature with this power, they simply pass straight through. However, the elemental has no natural attack and must use its powers instead.

All air elementals have the following power:

Suffocate, 0 points, Init equal to (Qik – 2), Auram R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

The elemental surrounds its opponent and enters its lungs, necessitating a roll to avoid deprivation. Escaping the elemental requires the victim to get away from the elemental, its airy body can be simply walked through, but the elemental usually pursues its victim. Compare Quickness + Athletics stress rolls of the victim and the elemental (using Might/5 for the elemental's Athletics); the highest wins. Trying to escape requires a Fatigue roll for the strenuous action.

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind The cohesiveness of a base Individual of Terram is lost, making it melt as if heated strongly, although the power imparts no heat to the object. Armor drips off its wearer, swords collapse like melting butter, and so forth. At the end of the round, the matter resolidifies into its new shape. If the item is enchanted, the elemental's Penetration must exceed five times the total pawns of vis invested. The moisture of living bodies prevents them from such a devastating effect; nevertheless, hair, toenails, teeth, claws, and bone are all affected, inflicting +15 damage and ignoring protection from armor.

Fire elementals, or phlegethi (singular phlegethus, meaning &quot;burners&quot;), also go by a host of other names, such as ignigena (Latin for &quot;fireborn&quot;), vulcans, rolamandri, salamanders (not to be confused with the Beasts of Virtue), and aethnici (a term also used for fiery demons; see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 67). They are uncommon on earth, for they can only rarefy from naturally occurring sources of flame — usually lightning strikes, but occasionally earth-fires, certain natural alchemical reactions, or the fire from the upper atmosphere. Feeding a naturally lit fire with fuel does not inhibit rarefication, and once formed, a fire elemental can consume normal fuel. A fire elemental is often short-lived, lasting as long as it has fuel, and prone to sudden movements of remarkable speed. Man's fascination for fire is often enhanced when viewing fire elementals, and they can easily beguile those who stare too deeply.

A phlegethus appears as a collection of flames that move contrary to nature. Each flame is actually a tetrahedron; sometimes these pyramids may be stretched long and thin, while at other times they may be low and flat. The motivations and instincts of a fire elemental are basic: they desire to burn, to consume cold and replace it with heat, and to escape confinement.

The body of a fire elemental is composed entirely of fire. The elemental can only cross surfaces composed of potentially flammable material; the more flammable it is, the faster it can move. Through typical vegetation in a temperate climate, a fire elemental can move at the speed of a running man. It may also jump a gap of nonflammable surface (such as bare rock) up to a width equal to its Magic Might in feet. Weapons are meaningless to a phlegethus; they simply pass straight through the elemental, and may catch fire. A source of water that is smaller than the elemental's Size is quenched on contact. Larger sources of water quench the elemental's body, inflicting &quot;wounds&quot; as if it were fire damage; typically +5 to +10 damage, but possibly more depending on the quantity. Successful water attacks destroy any Ignem vis that might have been present in the evaporated matter.

The elemental can have any Might less than that of the creature using this power. The elemental is automatically under the control of the creature; this power can also be used to control elementals which are not of the creature's own making, but in this case must Penetrate the elemental's Might.

This may be a distaff and spindle, or a pot, or a broom; it changes from time to time. Note that she is invisible to characters without an appropriate Virtue This Ghostly Warder (see the Magical Warder Virtue, page 93) was the character's mother, aunt, or possibly grandmother.

== Story Seed: A Qavernous Qage ==

A giant named Morag has been driven from his home deep in the mountains by a group of diabolists. He has wandered into the area near the covenant and started practicing the traditional trade of his people: robbery. His first act has been to ambush and capture a local knight, whom he now holds hostage in a cave — the entrance is sealed with a boulder so heavy, even Morag needs a stout lever to dislodge it. If the characters simply slay the giant, they may never be able to free his captive. On the other hand, Morag craves revenge against the diabolists and could be persuaded to join forces with the characters to destroy them.

== Story Seed: Repentance ==

The spirit of a local knight who died in battle some years ago still haunts his former lands, terrorizing the countryside in an attempt to force the living to lay him to rest and end what he thinks are the torments of Purgatory. Sir Giles believes his great sin was that he killed another knight in tournament. His eagerness to win glory was so great that he killed his opponent through excessive force. He thinks that if he can ensure his victim's widow is well cared for, he'll be able to go to Heaven. In fact, he is guite mistaken. His real sin is the pride that drove him to kill his opponent and even now prevents him from true repentance. Only when he comes to terms with how his pride stands in the way of his redemption, and how it caused suffering to others, will he truly pass on.

Fatigue levels: n/a The magical wolf is tireless. Wound Penalties: -1 (1-4), -3 (5-8), -5 (9-12),

Incapacitated (13–16)

Abilities: [Area] Lore 6 (game trails), Brawl 6 (biting), Hunt 7 (in a pack), Living Language 5 (hunting terminology). Survival 6 (forests)

Powers:

Pack of One, 2 points, Init +10, Animal: The wolf can create five duplicates of himself, who can then fight as a trained group. For these purposes, treat the wolf as having a Leadership score of 5, so that he can get the full +15 group bonus to his attacks. The power lasts until the pack brings down its opponent, which may be a group, or disengages from the fight. As the pack is really all one creature, the nomination of a vanguard is arbitrary. Further, the group does not need to disengage and reform when the vanguard is killed; it can seamlessly transfer the role to another wolf. Finally, the wolf only dies if all the copies are killed. When the duplicates vanish, the least wounded wolf remains.

Terrifying Howl, 4 points, Init +0, Mentem: Anyone who hears the wolf's howl is struck with fear of the wolf and of wilderness places away from the haunts of men. Someone already in a house will merely not want to leave. Overcoming this fear completely requires a Brave roll against an Ease Factor of 12. Acting sensibly while responding to it, such as heading back to the village carefully, requires a Brave roll against an Ease Factor of 6. Those who fail the easier roll simply flee in panic.

Wolf Lord, O points, constant, Animal: Any wolf the magical wolf strikes in deadly combat dies instantly. In addition, the magical wolf can make mundane wolves follow his instructions even when he is not around, as long as the instructions are quite simple.

Equipment: None. Magical though he is, he is still

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Vis: 4 pawns of Animal, in head.

Appearance: A gray male wolf, slightly larger than normal, but only slightly, and looking extremely healthy. His eyes, in particular, sparkle more brightly than should be possible.

The magical wolf does not care for such human niceties as names, and isn't particularly interested in human beings. Instead, he watches over all the wolves in his range, doing what he can to ensure their safety, health, and food supply. Sometimes, this means hunting wolves down himself, to keep population down, and in that case he removes the weak from the packs.

While he has no interest in human beings, he does see that they are important, and might be willing to negotiate with a village. On the other hand, he might decide to drive them out. This magical wolf has the same reactions to The Gift as a mundane animal, although other magical wolves may not.

<span id="mount-stna"></span>
== Mount Stna ==

A powerful and violent spirit of fire, Adranus, slumbers beneath a mountain on the Mediterranean island of Sicily. It has developed an antipathy towards the local peoples, since they long ago ceased worshipping it as a god. Nevertheless, it is satisfied when mortals stay away from its slopes and live in a state of respectful fear, but should they become too bold, disrespectful, or forgetful, the genius loci will become irritated and its sleep will be disturbed. Its wrath gradually builds up until the need to vent its fury is overwhelming, at which point the volcano erupts with spectacular and devastating force. Those few who venture onto the blasted and rocky slopes of the mountain have been known to go insane.

In ancient times, Adranus was worshiped by the primitive inhabitants of Sicily as a god of fire. When the Romans rose to prominence it was cast out by Vulcan, their god of fire and forge, but has since returned, and wreaks occasional and spectacular violent retribution on those who no longer either honor or fear it. A gateway to the Underworld was believed by the ancients to be situated beneath Etna. When using the Manifestation power, Adranus usually possesses one or more Sicilian eagles, the only creatures who will brave the mountain's heights. The volcano last erupted in 1194, and, if your saga follows real history, will next erupt in 1222.

<span id="story-seed-fire-and-puru"></span>
=== Story Seed: Fire and Puru ===

Maria, a young woman living in a village not far from the volcano, feels a strange empathy for fire, and she can predict the activity of the volcano through her dreams (she has the Visions Flaw). Her pregnant mother was the only survivor when the volcano destroyed the village during its last eruption a generation ago — only she heeded the warnings and made a miraculous escape. Maria, born with the same talent as her mother, makes dire predictions of an imminent eruption and begs the villagers to assuage the fire spirit to prevent it. They, however, scoff at her heathen mumblings, and so it looks as if the fire spirit will indeed return with a vengeance.

Grant Simple-Minded, 5 points, Init –12, Vim: The target gains the Simple-Minded Flaw. Adranus can grant the Flaw temporarily, in which case it does not recover the Might Points spent until it withdraws the Flaw, or permanently, in which case its Might Score is reduced by 5.

Grant Wrathful, 5 points, Init –12, Vim: The target gains the Wrathful Flaw. Adranus can grant the Flaw temporarily, in which case it does not recover the Might Points spent until it withdraws the Flaw, or permanently, in which case its Might Score is reduced by 5.

Hibernation, 15 points, lnit –32, Vim: The spirit remains completely inactive for a year (spending no other Might points); the 15 points spent on this power are saved and added to the Might Pool for the first year out of hibernation. In this fashion, the Might Pool may exceed the permanent Might score (50). Using this power, the volcano can save up Might points over many years in succession and have a great amount to spend in the single year in which it awakens.

Manifestation, 4 or more points, Init equal to (Qik – Might points spent), Animal R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind or Group Manifests the spirit's consciousness among animals it touches, temporarily granting them a Might score equal to the Might points spent, and controlling their actions. It is a Rego Herbam effect of Level 20 to control a plant that is a pace in diameter (costing 4 Might points), and a Rego Animal of Level 25 to control a single creature of Size +1 (costing 5 Might points). For an extra 2 Might points, a group of ten standard creatures (or the equivalent mass) can be controlled. For each

additional 2 Might points spent, the mass of creatures controlled is multiplied by 10. The spirit cannot spend more Might points on this power than the magnitude of its Magic Might. Humans and other sentient beings cannot be controlled by this power. Adranus is considered to be touching any animal on the mountain.

Presence, 0 points, constant, Imaginem R: Arc, D: Sun, T: Ind

Grants awareness of everything that happens within the bounds of Mount Etna. In essence, the spirit is coterminous with its associated landscape feature, so it is present simultaneously everywhere within its boundaries. The area controlled by the spirit can produce a yearly harvest of 5 pawns of Ignem vis, which manifests as physical objects within the controlled region. Harvesting this vis does not erode the spirit's Might. Inlm 30 (Base 2, +4 Arc, +2 Sun, +1 constant effect, +1 non-Hermetic effects)

Regio, 15 points, Init –32, Vim: By permanently spending Might, the spirit can add levels to the regio around the volcano's crater.

Vis: 10 pawns of Ignem vis, 5 pawns per year can also be harvested from the crater at the volcano's summit.

Appearance: Mount Etna is a conical and blasted peak that rises ten thousand feet above the eastern end of the island of Sicily.

<span id="revenants-the-walking-dead"></span>
== Revenants, the Walking Dead ==

While ghosts are the disembodied spirits of the dead, medieval stories also tell of restless dead who still occupy their material bodies. These are revenants or &quot;the walking dead,&quot; which differ from ghosts in that their only form is an animate, material corpse.

Although a revenant is bound to a physical body, its animating force is a spirit. Some magi consider them to be a special sub-class of ghosts. Like ghosts, Magical revenants are connected to the living world through some overwhelming personal need. Their motivations and personalities are as varied as those of ghosts.

The physical statistics of a revenant are also usable for corpses that have been animated by spells such as ''The Walking Corpse''. Such automatons are not supernatural beings and have no Might score (and hence no Magic Resistance).

<span id="fighting-the-walking-dead"></span>
== Fighting the Walking Dead ==

Magic can affect either a revenant's body (through the Form of Corpus) or the animating spirit (usually through Mentem or Vim). Destruction of the body does not harm the spirit, though the spirit may lack any power to affect the physical world once its body is destroyed.

Lay to Rest the Haunting Spirit can affect the animating spirit, provided the spirit is subject to the Form of Mentem. Magic can force the spirit out of the body, and if this happens (or if the body is destroyed) the spirit cannot re-enter the corpse or possess a new one unless it has specific powers allowing it to do so.

Revenants are difficult to harm with weapons. In particular, they cannot be Incapacitated, treat Incapacitating wounds as Heavy wounds instead.

<span id="option-resistance-to-piercing-teapons"></span>
== Option: Resistance to Piercing Teapons ==

Piercing weapons such as spears and arrows are effective against living beings, but potentially less so against the walking dead. Such weapons are unlikely to break bones or hack off limbs. The troupe may wish to grant revenants an additional +10 Soak bonus against such weapons, or simply rule them totally ineffective.

Ars Magica Fifth Edition does not formally differentiate weapons into categories such as &quot;piercing,&quot; so if the troupe adopts this option, they will sometimes have to exercise judgment about whether a weapon counts as a piercing weapon.

&quot;It was not long before men became aware that Glam was not easy in his grave. Many men suffered severe injuries, some who saw him were struck senseless and some lost their wits. Soon ... men began to think they saw him about their houses. The panic was great and many left the neighborhood. Next he began to ride on the house-tops by night, and nearly broke them to pieces. Almost night and day he walked, and people would scarcely venture up the valley, however pressing their business. The district was in a grievous condition.&quot;

— The Saga of Grettir the Strong

Perdo Corpus spells designed to target the living often have no effect on revenants, as their bodies are already dead. Spells that specifically break bones or destroy limbs do not hinder them as much as they do living people, but may cause Wound Penalties at the storyguide's discretion. For example, a broken leg might affect a revenant as if it were a Light wound. Perdo Corpus spells can, of course, be designed specifically to target the unquiet dead.

Different legends speak of special methods by which heroes can destroy the walking dead. In certain Icelandic sagas, a draug (revenant) could be destroyed by cutting off its head and placing it between its thighs. In a tale from Yorkshire, revenants could be destroyed by driving stakes through their hearts. A character who knows the correct method should make a regular melee attack. If the attack would have caused an Incapacitating or fatal wound against a Soak of +3, and if the attack was with the correct weapon (for instance, a wooden stake if that is the way to destroy this particular revenant), then the revenant's animating spirit is destroyed and any vis in the corpse is left behind. Learning the method for destroying a revenant may require a story, or if the storyguide prefers she can assign it an Ease Factor of 9 on an Intelligence + Magic Lore roll.

Medieval tales and illustrations depict both corpse-like walking dead and animated skeletons. The word &quot;zombie&quot; is of New World (Haitian) origin and would not be used by characters in Mythic Europe.

Wizards can animate corpses using Rego Corpus spells (or certain non-Hermetic powers). Such corpses use the same statistics as a revenant, with the following changes:

It does not suffer from fatigue and has the Soak listed in the statistics, but no powers of its own

A corpse animated by a spell has no Might score or Confidence score. Its Brawl skill is nominally 3, though as an optional rule the troupe may wish to assign a Brawl score equal to the caster's Finesse.

A corpse animated by demonic possession or a Magic spirit's Manifestation power has a Might score equal to the cost of that power. It uses the possessing spirit's Confidence score, if any. The controlling spirit may be able to use its powers through the possessed corpse (depending on the description of the possessing power).

The scitalis is a slow-moving serpent that relies on its marvelous appearance to stun its prey. The scitalis usually hunts by hiding near a water source or game trail. It typically preys on small animals, but has been known to attack humans if it feels threatened. Unlike mundane snakes, the blood of the scitalis is hot, enabling the serpent to remain active throughout the winter months.

En route to visit an important magus or noble, the characters stumble upon a scitalis, which tries to bite them as they stand spellbound. Little do they know that the scitalis was a warning from benevolent forces, as it foreshadows their upcoming visit: when they arrive at their destination, their host tries to impress them with lavish gifts and hospitality, while secretly planning to take advantage of them.

<span id="story-seed-a-magical-quarry"></span>
== Story Seed: A Magical Quarry ==

The characters need the healing powers in the antler of a Stag of Virtue to heal a sick friend. They can either hunt the stag or try to find one of its buried antlers. In many parts of Mythic Europe, hunting large game is a privilege reserved for the nobility. The characters may be accused of poaching, or they may find that the local noble is hunting the Stag of Virtue for himself. Because the Stag has the Ways of the Forest Virtue and an impressive Athletics score, it can be a difficult quarry.

serpent's hole; when the serpent emerges to escape drowning, the Stag of Virtue tramples it to death.

A Stag of Virtue enjoys vigorous health and can live a very long time (in fact, like other Beasts of Virtue, it can live forever). To keep itself youthful and healthy, this stag swallows a live, venomous serpent. Then it drinks a large quantity of water to neutralize the venom. After this process, its antlers fall off and its vigor is restored. Hermetic experts concur that the Stag of Virtue actually consumes Magical serpents for this process and that it becomes weak and looks aged when it cannot find snakes to eat (such as during the winter). The Stag of Virtue lives only in places where Magical snakes can be found.

The right antler of a Stag of Virtue has healing powers and is greatly sought by hedge wizards and magi alike. The stag always buries its antlers after shedding them. Anyone who consumes the flesh of a Stag of Virtue gains a Lesser Immunity to fevers for Moon duration. The stag itself is immune to fevers and the venison transfers this immunity through the Law of Contagion.

Powers:

Human Form: 1 point, Init 0, Corpus: The dragon can assume the form of a human being. This is always the same form, a man with dark hair and eyes, in the prime of life. The transformation lasts until

he eats or drinks, or until Stellatus uses the same power again to change back. The dragon has all his powers in human form, and the same Characteristics, but he is much weaker in combat and thus changes back if he needs to fight.

Instill Loyalty, 5 points, Init 0, Mentem: Stellatus can make any individual whom he can see totally loyal. This does not remove free will, but the victim is completely loyal to the dragon, and this loyalty lasts as long as Stellatus is alive.

Fiery Breath, 1 point, Init +5, Ignem: Stellatus can breathe fire. The fire extends in a cone from his mouth, out to a distance of 20 paces, where it is 20 paces across. The fire has an intensity of +15. Dodging it is a Qik + Athletics roll against an Ease Factor of 9. A failure means that the character is engulfed in the flames, taking +45 damage, a success by 3 points or less means that a limb is covered, for +30 damage, a success by 4 to 6 points (that is, success against Ease Factor 12) means that the character is only brushed by the flames, for +15 damage, while success by 7 points or more (that is, success against Ease Factor 15) means that the character dodges out of the fire entirely.

Master of Fire, 1 or more Might Points, Init 0, Ignem: Stellatus can control fire. He can duplicate any Hermetic Rego Ignem spell of fourth magnitude or less at the cost of 1 Might point. For every additional Might point he spends, the level of the spell increases by one magnitude.

Equipment: Ancient treasure is piled high in his lair.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Vis: 5 pawns of Ignem vis in each eye.

Appearance: An enormous lizard with great wings, covered in scales of red so dark as to be almost black. His eyes are lit from within by a smoldering orange glow. Although he is a little on the small side for a dragon, he is larger than most houses.

Stellatus is an ancient dragon who has laired under the same mountain range for centuries. Most of the time he lies quietly in his lair, contemplating his treasure, or travels the area around in human form (he can go for weeks without eating or drinking). Every couple of centuries, he erupts in draconic form to carry out some plan or seize some item, and every decade or so some would-be hero disturbs him.

The dragon is aware of The Gift, but it inspires him with curiosity, making him less likely to simply kill magi who enter his lair. A Tytalus maga did spend some time challenging the dragon in various ways, and although Stellatus eventually killed her by rigging an entirely mundane rock-fall trap, he quite enjoyed the experience. He regards himself as superior to all Hermetic magi, and is firmly convinced that he is immune to their magic. With a Magic Resistance of 50, this is almost, but not quite, true.

Master of Sound, variable points, Init +5 – Might cost, Imaginem: The spirit can duplicate any non-Ritual spell involving sound up to Level 15, at a cost of 1 Might Point per magnitude of effect. (Te)Im15

Bring Down the Roof, 2 points, Init +3, Terram: The Zwergenstimme can cause the roof of a cave to collapse, crushing any within it. This causes +20 damage, and seals the exit from the cave.

PeTe 20 (base 3, +1 Touch, +2 Room, +2 Size)

Presence, 0 points, constant, Imaginem: Grants awareness of everything that happens within the bounds of a specific domain chosen by the spirit. In essence, the spirit is coterminous with its associated landscape feature, so it is present simultaneously everywhere within its boundaries. The area controlled by the spirit can produce a yearly harvest of 2 pawns of vis of an appropriate Form, which manifests as physical objects within the controlled region. Harvesting this vis does not erode the spirit's Might. The echo spirit can haunt a series of caves (constituting a Structure).

Ghost Touch, variable cost, Init +2, Terram: The spirit can hurl rocks at enemies. It uses the combat scores listed above, but each attack costs 1 Might point.

Vis: 3 pawns of Imaginem, as an immaterial echo Appearance: An echo. This spirit appears only as auditory species to those with Second Sight

This spirit of an echo lurks in caves or ravines. Its name literally means &quot;dwarf voice&quot; in German, and these spirits have been known to mislead lost humans by &quot;playing&quot; with them. The spirit certainly has no intent to harm; it doesn't even understand what harm is.

<span id="creatures-of-paerie"></span>
== Creatures of Paerie ==

aeries are essentially bound to stories, and their roles in those stories. They are made up of stray matter held together with mystical rules.

Despite this, their physical attacks are not blocked by Magic Resistance, including the Parma Magica.

Faeries cannot break their roles. They would prefer to die, because death is rarely permanent for faeries.

Faeries have Pretenses instead of Abilities. Most faeries cannot learn, so they use faerie glamour to mimic human Abilities. Skill in mimicking a particular Ability is called Pretense. This is not quite the same as an Ability, and a skilled character, with a score of 5 or more, may be able to tell. For example, a character with a Single Weapon Ability of 5 or more, when facing a faerie, may make a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 12 – the Ability score the faerie is pretending to have. If successful, the character realizes that the faerie's weapon does not travel through all the space between its strikes and blocks, sometimes it simply appears in the locations where its movements end.

In most scenarios, the difference between abilities and pretenses is insignificant. A faerie knight trying to kill a character is still dangerous regardless of whether he is using his sword the way a human would. In some scenarios, spotting that a character is using pretense is a way of detecting their faerie nature.

<span id="dew-virtues-and-flaws"></span>
== Dew Virtues and Flaws ==

Faeries have an innate ability to regenerate damage, retaining only those superficial injuries necessary to make their roles believable. They never suffer fatigue, although they may pretend to. They are unencumbered by the normal accoutrements of the role they are playing, which are formed from the glamour of the faerie, and increase its Touch range.

Cognizance is the degree to which a faerie knows it is a faerie, and what that means about its relationship to stories. Most have the Narrowly Cognizant Free Virtue. This means they are aware of their faerie nature in a limited way. They try to play a role accurately, and cannot break role even if it leads to their deaths. There are some faeries, with the Highly Cognizant Virtue, who are able to adapt their roles to feed

on human emotional energy. These are the most dangerous faeries, because they are able to change their roles. Incognizant faeries, conversely, do not even know they are faeries: they follow their roles because they have no potential to understand any other option.

Faerie Sight is the ability to read glamour, the magical rules from which faeries are constructed. Assume that characters with Faerie Sight can see magical things, and tell what other faeries want, just by looking at them.

Faerie Speech allows faeries to converse in the language of their audience. They can speak any language that someone has used to speak to them, and this effect does not need to Penetrate because it only affects the faerie.

A Traditional Ward is a taboo: the faerie may not touch a thing protected by the ward with its glamour. The faerie is likely uncomfortable in the presence of the ward, but is not compelled to flee. The faerie cannot regenerate Might points in the presence of a traditional ward. If forced to touch the ward the glamour holding the faerie's body together begins to decay. The damage to the faerie's body can be simulated with the Heat and Corrosion rules. Assume that the object acts as a source of damage with an intensity of +6.

A Sovereign Ward is a powerful taboo. A faerie cannot hurt someone carrying that faerie's sovereign ward. This includes indirect harm like burning down the building the warded person is in, or poisoning the well at which they are likely to drink. Direct contact with a sovereign ward destroys the body of a faerie, removing it from the scenario.

Realms of Power: Faerie contains much more detail on faeries and their realms, along with many more examples of faerie creatures.

Powers:

The powers below are commonly found in Faerie Hounds, but it is rare for a single hound to have more than two of them.

Damaging Effect: 2 points: Init 0, Varies: Causes all of the faerie's weapons, which are part of its glamor, to take on a more deadly aspect for two minutes. The danger of the aspect varies according to the motif usual for the faerie, but always increases the weapon's Damage by +5.

Enthralling Sound: 3 points, Init –2, Mentem: Used to cause terror and panic with its howl. This power also increases the intensity of an emotion that already exists. A stress roll with an appropriate Personality trait against an Ease Factor of 9 allows a victim to overcome this power's effect.

Enthrallment: 4 points, Init -2, Mentem: Allows the faerie to take complete control of a single human's mind for a day, by making eye contact.

Fearful Flaming Eyes: 2 points, Init –2, Corpus: Completely paralyzes a human who makes eye contact with the faerie.

Hound: 2 points, Init 0, Corpus: Allows the faerie to know the direction and distance to its human quarry.

Flight: 0 points, constant +2, Animal: The character is capable of flight. The character may use the Athletics skill to simulate difficult maneuvers, but may not engage in combat while flying incredibly swiftly. The faerie may not fly when heavily encumbered, or with a passenger of its Size or more, unless assisted by another faerie that shares the load.

Vis: 1 pawn Animal, dog corpse

Appearance: Faerie hounds are usually of chunky, hunting breeds. Many have shining eyes, and almost all have black, white or green fur. These statistics also suit the hunting hounds of the courtly fae. This type of faerie hound often has a white coat, red ears and blue eyes.

<span id="facric-lound-variants"></span>
==== Facric Lound Variants ====

In part of France, this role is filled by a terrifying goat.

Aufhocker, found in German-speaking areas, acts as a kelpie, and uses a power to cling to foes while goring them so that his weight adds 6 to their combat Load.

Kludie, from Belgium, is the most powerful variant of this beast. It can take monstrously-large versions of the forms of dog, cat, bat, horse or frog. It walks on its back legs, with a dancing movement as it sprints toward its victim. It is preceded by supernatural blue flames. Kludie knows the trick of bouncing on the back of his quarry and using a power to drag his prey down. He also does the kelpie trick, dunking or drowning those who mount him in horse form.

Huge faerie dogs haunt the roads of much of Mythic Europe. They terrify, and sometimes kill, travelers. Some can run rapidly, and others run upon their hindlimbs when chasing humans, to have their teeth closer to the victim's throat.

Many knights have far higher scores than this. These statistics are correct for faeries that plan to improve their Pretenses by losing to a character, then mirroring his experience gain for the season.

Powers

Damaging Effect: 1 point, Init –4, as per motif of court: Causes all of the faerie's weapons, which are part of its glamor, to take on a more deadly aspect for two minutes. The danger of the aspect varies according to the motif usual for the faerie, but always increases the weapon's Damage by +5.

Flight, 2 points, constant, Corpus: The character is capable of flight. The character may use the Athletics skill to simulate difficult maneuvers, but may not engage in combat while flying incredibly swiftly. The faerie may not fly when heavily encumbered, or with a passenger of its Size or more, unless assisted by another faerie that shares the load.

Shift Human Shapes: 1 point, Init 0, Corpus: Allows the knight, who is usually armored to demonstrate his role, to remove the armor simply by thinking about it

Equipment: Arms and armor. Has a faerie horse constructed of the knight's own glamour, so it flies when the knight does, and shares the knight's Magic Resistance.

Vis: 2 pawns, often rusty pieces of armor that the knight has poured its glamour into.

Appearance: A knight clad in silver leaves of metal, astride a fine horse. These knights often display the motif of their court on their surcoat, shield and pavilion.

These faeries are often encountered outside courts, on lonely roads, and guarding bridges. They seek out defeat by humans as a way of gaining additional combat Pretenses. They are never seen with their armor off, so they may be a role that other faeries take on when they wish to enjoy some blood sport. Faerie Knights are more bound to the rules of chivalry than real knights, and so they do not use the Damaging Effect Power on their weapons against worthy foes.

Appearance: This faerie may appear as a beautiful maiden, a crone or an adolescent girl. She wears a white dress and carries a scythe or shears. She may travel as a dust devil, and is used as a nursery terror, to frighten children so that they do not harm crops.

Poludnica usually appears around noon on hot days, and asks farmhands difficult questions, or engages them in conversation. If the farmhand tries to change the topic of their conversation, or cannot answer one of the faerie's questions, she gives him heatstroke. If particularly annoyed at this farmhand she might instead drive him insane, or cause his death from hyperthermia. Poludnica are unable to spend Might points during the winter.

<span id="story-seed-południca"></span>
== Story Seed: Południca ==

There is a little girl in a village near the covenant who has an imaginary friend. Her friend is a hyperthermia faerie, like Południca. The girl, through an artistic temperament, some luck and an invitation to play, has convinced the spirit that it should express emotional, rather than atmospheric, warmth toward the girl. The girl's friendship with the faerie keeps it close to her village, and does not alter its attitude to other humans, so she poses a terrible risk to her neighbours. The girl can be used as bait to trap the faerie and destroy it.

Skilled characters might, instead, trap the faerie and over the course of years, alter it. They would need to find a way to feed it sufficient vitality that it can change role, spread stories about the faerie that make the change of role easier, defend the role against other faeries that attempt to fill it, then coach the girl to collaborate with it, so that it becomes a more helpful harvest faerie.

Heady Brew, 0 points, Init -10, Corpus: Any drink served by Mateos is three times as intoxicating as normal. Drinks that were non-alcoholic to start with become as alcoholic as ale. This does not change the taste of the drink. The extra intoxication is a magical effect, with Penetration 10, and can be resisted.

Unending Drinks, 1 point, Init –10, Aguam: For as long as he is serving a particular person, the drink in Mateos's barrel does not run out, even if he serves other people as well. If the chosen person (who is not the target of the power, and thus cannot resist) leaves, passes out, or stops drinking for any other reason, the contents of the barrel start to run out.

Equipment: Barrel of alcoholic drink.

Encumbrance: 3 (3)

Vis: 1 pawn of Herbam in each hand.

Appearance: Mateos is the size of a child, with a large pot belly, full beard sprinkled with gray, and a slightly grubby apron. He is always smiling, and offers just about everyone he meets a drink from his barrel.

Mateos lives for parties, particularly parties with lots of drunkenness and stupid behavior. If he arrives somewhere where there isn't a party, he tries to start one. With his faerie ale (or wine, or cider), it doesn't usually take him very long. Once people start getting drunk, he tries to convince them to do ridiculous and embarrassing things. He does not usually encourage people to do things that could kill them, however. The parties normally finish with everyone but Mateos passed out on the floor.

The Gift makes Mateos feel that the Gifted individual is a killjoy opposed to parties, and someone to be hurried out of the way as soon as possible.

This jinni, one of the jann, is a mercenary guide, forced to wander from caravanserai to caravanserai along the trade routes of the Levant, Arabia, Persia, Transoxiana, and beyond for a crime his brother committed. An excellent swordsman and skilled outdoorsman, he is well known among the Muslim merchants and even Levantine Redcaps for his easy-going nature and bravado in defending caravans from raiders and brigands. Like most Faerie jinn, he can change into an animal form — in his case, a white wild Bactrian camel using his Skinchanger Virtue. Although immune to Fatigue like other faeries, Jumayl is unusually susceptible to the effects of mundane alcohol — a weakness that helps him to play his role within stories along the caravan routes. Unlike most faeries, his Might points, once spent, can only recover if he gets a full night's rest and eats a meal in the company of fellow travelers. This must be done within a human community, eating travel rations or caravanserai meals, drinking beverages fermented by humans and listening to humans sing or tell tales about their travels. For every eight hours the character rests, he recovers a number of Might Points equal to the prevailing Aura as modified by the Realm Interaction Table, or 1, whichever is greater. He does not actually need to eat or drink however. Jumayl knows enough about wizards to avoid leaving Arcane Connections carelessly and keeps his True Name a close secret.

Pretenses: [Area] Lore 6 (hunting tracks), Athletics 5 (running), Awareness 8 (spotting quarry), Brawl 3 (bite), Hunt 10 (human beings), Living Language 2 (threats), Stealth 9 (hunting), Survival 7 (forests)

Powers:

Marked Quarry: 1 point, Init +5, Mentem: Tarlan can pick a single human being whom he can see and who can see him, and mark him as quarry for the hunt. This inspires the victim with a strong fear of Tarlan, requiring a Brave roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to overcome, and specifically makes him likely to run.

Prey's Vigor: 1 point, Init +8, Corpus: By breathing on a tired person (anyone who has lost Fatigue levels), Tarlan can restore them to full vigor (i.e. all Fatigue levels are regained). However, the target also ages one year. This power can only be used if the target is close enough to actually feel the wolf's breath on his skin, and only works on adults.

Silent Running: 0 points, constant, Imaginem: Tarlan makes no noise unless he deliberately decides to.

Equipment: None. He's a wolf.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Vis: 2 pawns of Intellego in his nose, 1 pawn of

Intellego in each ear.

Appearance: A large, deep black wolf with eyes that glint even when there seems to be no light around. He moves silently and can stay hidden unless he really wants his quarry to see him.

Tarlan exists to hunt people. He picks individuals who are in the wilderness by themselves, marks them as quarry, and then harries them to exhaustion. Once they can run no further, he bursts out of cover, and, somehow, the victims regain their vigor at that moment, finding that they can run away once more. The wolf can keep the hunt up indefinitely, but normally he times a final attack, on an exhausted victim, to happen just before dawn. If the quarry is particularly resourceful, he might keep the hunt up longer.

Tarlan does not always kill his victims, leaving some alive to tell the tale of their ordeal. He likes the idea that people are scared of him even before he uses his power. Indeed, he has occasionally not needed to use Marked Quarry at all.

The wolf does have one weakness. He cannot enter holy ground, so a victim who can run into a church or graveyard is safe. Tarlan knows this, and tries to herd his victims away from such places. In addition, because Prey's Vigor cannot affect children, Tarlan never hunts them. In fact, he's come to feel somewhat protective of them, on the grounds that, if he can't hunt them, no-one else is going to. Finally, The Gift inspires respect in the faerie. He never hunts Gifted individuals, and might even be happy to work with one who let him hunt people.

These minor goddesses of the Norse pantheon are no longer worshiped in Mythic Europe, but have been encountered by magi in Elysium, and in their ancient places of power in Scandinavia. Their name means &quot;Chooser of the Slain&quot;, because they are believed to choose who lives and dies during battle, and which spirits are worthy of transformation into einherjar, spiritual warriors awaiting Ragnarok. They also act as serving maids in Valhalla. Many have names that evoke the tumult of battle. They ride through the sky, invisibly, on wolves.

<span id="great-lezi-variants"></span>
==== Great Lezi Variants ====

Gigantic fauns are found in the Basque country in Iberia. Once they were much like other fauns, although even then they had striking red fur. When humans won the right to till the country, these fauns became agricultural faeries. They use their great height to plan agricultural improvements, perform feats of remarkable engineering, and shout warnings when predators approach. In the region they are called Basajauns, but this is confusing because Basajaun is a large, wild faun in the folklore of the surrounding peoples, who keeps house with his wife and human slaves.

==== Powers: ====

Extended Glamour: 0 points, constant, Mentem: Grants awareness of everything that happens within the bounds of the forest. In essence, the faerie is coterminous with the forest, so it is present simultaneously everywhere within its boundaries.

Focus Power (Manifestation): 5 points, Init –5*, Animal or Herbam: Manifests the faerie's consciousness amongst animal and plant life its glamor touches, temporarily controlling their actions. This power allows the lezi to simulate any Creo Animal, Rego Animal, Creo Herbam or Rego Herbam effect with a value of 25 spell levels or less, targeted at the animals within its glamor and suiting its motif.

Focus Power (Woodland Change): 5 points, Init –5*, Animal or Herbam: Muto and Intellego effects only in Herbam and Animal.

Focus Power (Size Reduction): 5 points, Init –5, Corpus or Animal: Greater Lezi are considered to naturally be Size +7, and use powers to live at a smaller Size.

Transform Into Animal**: 3 points, Init. -3*, Animal: Transforms the character into a land animal. Faeries retain the power of speech in animal form.

Transform Into Bird or Fish**: 3 points, Init: -3*, Animal: Transforms the character into a specified bird or fish. Faeries retain the power of speech in animal form.

Transform into Human: This power costs the Lezi whatever it cost to transform away from the human shape.

Transform Into Object (Plant)**: 4 points, Init -4*, Herbam: In plant form, the lezi is capable of speech and limited movement.

\* Add appropriate Quickness modifier, based on Size.

\** Lezi are extraordinary in that they can change into any animal or plant from their woodland: they do not specify alternative forms as other creatures do.

Equipment: Can fabricate an endless variety of material from the woodland.

Vis: 8 pawns, External vis, club

The Forest Lord is found in Slavic lands. He usually appears as a tall, pale, bearded man with emerald eyes, but can take the shape of any plant or animal. He may change his size from that of a blade of grass to that of a tall tree. Many lezi have feet that face backward, and many are faunlike. Great Lezi command woodland animals, particularly wolves. The term &quot;great&quot; is used to compare this creature to the more common lezi, which is a form of faun.

Powers:

Commanding Presence, 1 point, Init +10, Mentem: Anyone who can see Marsyne becomes awed by him, and gains a Personality Trait of Respectful to Lord Marsyne +3. Even magi must roll this Trait, if they fail to resist the spell. Disagreeing with him is Ease Factor 6, outright contradiction is Ease Factor 9, and attacking is Ease Factor 15. This power does not force obedience to the faerie's commands, but it does force you to be subtle about refusing.

Entomb, 10 points, Init –10, Mentem: A single human target is entombed in ice. The effect is Mentem because it also suspends the target's awareness, so that he or she does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, and does not think, dream, or remember while in the ice. Marsyne can break the effect at will, or it can be dispelled. If it is broken, the person returns to awareness without, immediately, realizing that they were unconscious. People do, normally, age while entombed, and can die of old age.

Gift of Youth, 10 points, Init –10, Corpus: This power targets a single woman, who stops aging. As long as she remains in Marsyne's castle, she does not age at all. If she leaves, she has the benefit of the Unaging Minor Virtue, so she might not realize that she is aging again. Once aging has restarted, it does not stop if the woman returns to the castle. The power only works on human women, and Marsyne normally only uses it on his wives.

Inner Warmth, 1 point, Init 0, Ignem: The recipient of this gift is unaffected by mundane cold until she (or he) enters an aura aligned with a realm other than Faerie. (Simply leaving a Faerie aura for an area with no aura doesn't end it, but entering a Magic, Infernal, or Divine aura does.) The gift provides no protection against magical cold.

Lord of Ice, 1 or more points, Init +8, Aquam: Marsyne can create any effect he wants involving ice, including effects that would require a Hermetic ritual. For every point he spends, up to a maximum of 5, the effect has three Hermetic magnitudes of power. Thus, if he spends 5 points, he can create a 15th magnitude effect.

Lord of the Castle, 0 points, Init +15, Mentem or Corpus: Marsyne can command any one of his servants to do anything, and the command is irresistible. He can also take control of the servant's body, and move it like a puppet, or even make it fly through the air. The only limits are that he can only target one servant at once, and can only target beings who have voluntarily agreed to serve him. Most are faeries, but his wives also qualify.

Equipment: Anything he wants, although particularly elaborate items gained particularly quickly will be faerie glamor rather than real.

Encumbrance: 0 (0)

Vis: 10 Aquam, in his blood.

Appearance: Tall, well-built, and handsome, with white skin, pale blond hair, and eyes the clear gray of sea ice. He wears fine clothes in white and blue, and a crown of diamonds rests on his brow. He almost looks like a human being, but the authority in his voice belies that, as does the fact that literal ice water runs in his veins; when he bleeds, there are small crystals of ice in the water that flows out.

Lord Marsyne is the ruler of a faerie domain in the far north or in a range of high mountains. His home is a castle of fantastic beauty, made entirely of ice, and he has an extensive faerie retinue. Marsyne and his faeries act out an elaborate charade of the routines and festivals of mundane noble life, hunting strange creatures, holding tournaments, and even passing judgment on criminals

within the court. Most of the time, the court has little direct contact with humans. However, Lord Marsyne always has a human wife, and every so often he needs to find a new one. He always chooses a beautiful, young woman, and looks for some spark of creativity, independence, and spirit. He is quite

== taken by The Gift, and any beautiful, young Gifted woman in the area he is searching is very likely to be wooed. The wooing is utterly sincere, as the wife must return of her own free will. ==

Marsyne's wife plays an important role in the politics of the court, having her own set of faerie ladies-in-waiting and servants, and presiding over many of the tournaments. She also plays an important mystical role, as her presence and creativity allow the faeries to do new things. One thing she is not, is a physical wife to Lord Marsyne.

As long as the wife follows the rules of the court, everything is fine. Marsyne makes her unaging, and protects her from the cold. If she breaks the rules, however, Marsyne judges her, entombs her in ice, and seeks out a new wife. He has many entombed wives, as some of the rules are along the lines of the classic &quot;Do not go into this room. Here is the key.&quot;

It is also possible for a wife to win her freedom, either through a successful challenge by an external champion, or through her own wits. Lord Marsyne remains fond of any wife who wins her freedom fairly, because that is part of the rules, but any who simply flee are brought back and entombed in the ice.

<span id="infernal-creatures-1"></span>
== Infernal Creatures ==

nfernal creatures are sometimes called demons or devils. These terms refer to the same group of creatures, and the choice of which to use is purely a matter

of personal preference. There are some creatures with Infernal Might that are not true demons — physical beings that have been greatly corrupted by the Infernal. These beings may not have all the powers and features of true demons.

All demons can put off their physical forms and revert to being pure spirits at will. In combat, they can only do this on their action, but while they are not physical, they cannot attack or be attacked physically. They can also move as quickly as they like, and are not hindered by physical barriers, but they remain fully aware of their surroundings.

Demons are never noticeably bothered by The Gift. This may be because they try their best to damn everyone, so hostile behavior towards The Gifted looks no different.

<span id="demonic-powers-1"></span>
== Demonic Powers ==

All demons have the following powers:

Coagulation, 1 point per 10 Might (or fraction), Init –1, Corpus: This power allows demons to manufacture a solid body from the ambient, unformed matter of the universe. They may only take a single specific form with this power (the one described under Appearance in the demon's statistics) unless they have another power which allows them to alter it. Manifesting a physical form takes a round for every point of Infernal Might possessed by the demon, those with a high Infernal Might have more power which they must collect and force into solid form. The demon can end this power at any time, allowing its body to become finer and more rarefied and return to its natural state. Dissolution of the solid form is almost instantaneous, taking only a round of concentration from the demon, although this concentration may be disrupted.

The game statistics of a demon do not change regardless of whether it is in its physical or spiritual form, although a demon in spiritual form may not use its physical Characteristics. This power may not be a Corpus effect if the demon's body is naturally of a different substance, such as composed of elemental matter, or in the shape of an animal. Demons in Christian lands are forced to abandon their coagulated form on Holy Saturday (see Religious Limitations on Demons, later).

Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init –5, Vim. Every demon possesses a particular sin — called its Obsession Trait — which it may attempt to impose upon a mortal whenever the mortal indulges in a venial sin. A demon can only use this power when there is a chink in the armor of virtue; that is, when a person is indulging in sinful thoughts or deeds. At this moment, the demon can impose its Obsession trait, if it penetrates Magic Resistance. The victim is assailed with sinful thoughts, and acquires a Personality Trait to represent these thoughts, with a score equal to the number of Might points spent by the demon (maximum of 3). When the victim is next presented with the opportunity to act on the Obsession Trait, the victim's player must make a simple roll and add the Obsession Trait; this must be lower than a simple roll + any other suitable Personality Trait to successfully resist the impulses (a Trait which is similar to the imposed Trait may act as a penalty instead). If the Obsession roll fails, then the demon's power has failed and the Obsession trait is lost. If the Obsession roll is higher, the victim gives in to sin, permanently acquiring the Obsession Trait at +1 (or increasing it by one if he already possesses it). Any further succumbing to this trait counts as sinful, rather than as an action forced by a demon.

Each demon can inflict only certain traits, representing its particular role in the corruption of mankind, these Personality Traits are listed under the creature's powers. Due to its low initiative, it is

<span id="example-of-obsession"></span>
== Example of Obsession ==

Bartholomew has the Obsession Trait of Avarice. He sees a nun collecting alms for the orphanage, and bumps into her deliberately on the street. The nun's flash of anger over his apparent clumsiness gives Bartholomew the doorway he needs, and he imposes the Trait upon her, spending three of his Might Pool. When the nun is counting her pennies later that day, she has an opportunity to act on the demonically-induced greed, so is forced to make an Avarice personality roll. She rolls a 5, +3 for the Obsession trait for a total of 8. Her opposing die roll is only a 6, but she also has the Generous Personality Trait, for a total of 9. She resists the impulse to steal, and resolves to pray harder, shocked that she even considered such an act.

The next day, Bartholomew observes a reeve fleecing his lord of taxes, and imposes his Avarice trait on him, again spending 3 points. The reeve is immediately presented with the opportunity to be even more larcenous, so must make a roll. He rolls a simple die (3) and adds the Obsession Trait of +3 for a total of 6. The opposing die roll (a 6) is penalised by the reeve's own Greedy Personality Trait of +1, and so the reeve steals even more money from his lord than he was intending. The reeve's Greedy trait increases to +2, and Bartholomew makes a note to return here again soon.

unlikely that this power will be used by a demon when in physical combat.

Envisioning, 1 or 5 points, Init +0, Mentem: This power allows a demon to appear in the dreams of a sleeping target (in which case it costs 1 point), or make the target experience a waking dream or vision (in which case it costs 5 points). A demon cannot instantly make substantial changes to a dream, but can gradually twist it to take on a darker and frightening tone, and can speak through any figure from the victim's subconscious. A waking dream is more obvious; the victim suffers an immediate and powerful hallucination of whatever the demon desires. This may be so frightening that the victim is stunned for a round, and must make a Brave Personality roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or have an extreme reaction, such as retching, convulsions or abject terror. This is the only way in which a spiritual demon can communicate with mortals.

Many (but not all) demons also have the following power:

Possession, variable points, Init +2, Mentem: To possess a human, the demon may expend any number of points from its Might Pool to create a Possession Might Pool; these points actually enter the possessed creature and will not be regenerated by the demon until the possession is ended. The more of its Might it expends to use this power, the more the demon can do with its host (also called an energumen), but the weaker the Penetration. If the target's resistance is overcome by this power, the victim is possessed by the demon, and is under its direct control. If the demon uses all of its current Might Pool in a possession then its spiritual form effectively enters the victim and resides within (forcing the loss of any physical form). Alternatively, a demon may divide its consciousness by only placing a portion of its Might within a victim, allowing the possessing part of it to act independently from the rest (which remains in spiritual or physical form). In this situation, the separate parts of the demon's consciousness may only communicate information learned since the split when within sight of each other; otherwise they should be considered independent copies of the demon's mind.

The demon may use any of its powers that it has sufficient Possession Might Pool to use, but these points do not regenerate until the possession ends. The demon may choose to extend its power over its host to give it Magic Resistance equal to the Possession Might, if it does so, then the host is excluded from wards against supernatural beings just as if it were the demon itself. The same is true if the host is currently under the effects of one of the demon's powers. In all other situations, the demon can 'hide' within the host, and walk through such wards with impunity.

If the demon attempts to force the victim to act contrary to his nature, or to use any of the energumen's own magical powers, the demon

must spend points from its Possession Might Pool. A supernatural power (including spell-casting) requires 1 Might point per magnitude (for a spell or similar effect); 1 Might point per point of a Supernatural Ability (such as Entrancement), or Might points equal to the Might points expended by the energumen. A questionable action which is contrary to the nature of the host requires the demon to exceed the possessed being's Personality Trait roll on a stress die + Might points spent. The storyguide may give a modifier to the Personality Trait roll based on the nature of the command. Over time, exercise of the demon's Obsession power on the host may result in a reduced resistance to such questionable actions. Note that use of a supernatural power might also be contrary to the victim's nature, in which case both costs must be met.

Once the Possession Might Pool placed into the victim reaches zero, the possession ends. Note that a being can be possessed with as little as 1 Might point, as long as the demon does not wish to do too much with its host. Furthermore, a demon may possess more than one host simultaneously, and can direct each independently. Vim spells may be used on the energumen to target the demon rather than the host; these must overcome the demon's Infernal Might in the usual way, but drain the Possession Might Pool, not the Infernal Might.

<span id="demons-and-magic"></span>
== Demons and Magic ==

Hermetic magic cannot pierce any deception produced by a demon, although other varieties of Supernatural Powers (particularly Divine Powers) may well be able to do so. A demon's lie is not detected with Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie, a demonic illusion does not show up as false with Discern the Images of Truth and Falsehood, and a shape-changed demon appears to be a mundane creature if Sight of the True Form is used. Even if a magus casts a spell of compulsion on a demon, he cannot force it to tell the truth. This 'protection' from truth-revealing magics need not involve an active act of deception on behalf of the demon; the presence of a demon's Infernal Might is invisible to Hermetic magic, as is the stench of Hell in their Infernal Powers. However, only Infernal Powers used by demons are immune to detection; use of Infernal Powers by humans may be detected with Hermetic magic.

The Ease Factor for the Second Sight Ability to detect naturally invisible things (such as spirits) is normally 9. However, the sheer deceptiveness of demons is such that this Ease Factor is increased by the magnitude of their Might. If this Ability derives from non-Divine sources, then it may not pierce illusions created by demons at all; in the case of Second Sight of a Divine origin, use the normal Ease Factor of 6 + magnitude of Might to pierce these deceptions.

A Hermetic magus must be able to sense his target to affect it, and a demon in its spiritual form cannot be sensed through mundane means, nor may it be sensed through Hermetic magic due to its inherent deceptiveness. If a spiritual demon can be tricked into using its supernatural powers (and a magus is able to detect the power's effect without the use of Hermetic magic) then he can target the demon with his spells. Otherwise, he must rely on other resources such as Second Sight, Sense Holiness and Unholiness, or Divine Powers (his own or another's) to reveal the demon.

Demons can be warded off by the Form listed next to their Infernal Might, and, if in physical form, may be affected by magics corresponding to that Form. Thus, in addition to the Rego Vim spell Ward Against Demons, which affects all demons, there is a Rego Animal Ward Against Animal Demons, a Rego Aquam Ward Against Water Demons, and so forth. Demons are mostly intelligent beings and may also be targeted by Mentem spells.

The Infernal Might of a demon may be manipulated with the Art of Vim. Demons may be attacked with Perdo Vim spells such as Demon's Eternal Oblivion (or its non-Hermetic equivalents) in either form, assuming the target has been sensed. The Infernal Might of the demon is reduced by a successful casting of this spell, and the demon also loses any Might Pool that exceeds its new reduced Infernal Might. As the demon's Infernal Might is reduced, subsequent Perdo Vim spells penetrate more easily, and have greater effect. The demon's body is actually eroded using these magics, and a demon that is reduced to an Infernal Might of zero is destroyed, leaving behind no corpse (and thus no vis). Demons in either spiritual or physical form may be attacked with these spells and the result is the same.

All demons are entirely immune to magic which would cause them to act in a contrary way to their Personality Traits.

Demons may be summoned and compelled by Hermetic Magic, although the Oath of Hermes specifically forbids it. Knowing a spell which will either summon or compel a demon is grounds for expulsion from the Order and a Wizard's March.

<span id="demonic-ceaknesses"></span>
== Demonic Ceaknesses ==

All demons are vulnerable to expressions of God's power, whether this is the sacraments of a faith, a prayer from a devout follower, or the relic of a saint. Relics, as supremely holy items, are anathema to demons, as described in the Realms chapter (page 419). A character who has a focus for her prayers (such as a rosary, a phylactery or so forth) and who successfully invokes God's aid to defeat a demon (see ''Realms of Power: The Divine'', page 41) gains twice the usual bonus. Any object which is an intrinsic part of Divine worship, but not actually a relic in its own right (such as a Church bible, the

Host, the scrolls of the Torah) is a Vulnerability (see below) of all demons.

All demons have an additional weakness. These may place limits on what a demon can and cannot do (in any form), or it might cause wounds in some circumstances, in which case only the physical form is affected. To determine whether a character has learned the weakness of a specific demon, he must have had some prior exposure to knowledge of the demon (for example, through study of a catalog of demons), and must make an Intelligence + Infernal Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 9 + (Might /5). Subtract 3 from the Ease Factor if the demon is a member of a family, for all members of a family share the same weakness. Failure indicates that the character does not know the weakness of this demon, but can make another attempt to discover it once his score in Infernal Lore increases.

Weaknesses should be chosen from the following list:

Abhorrent Material/Circumstance: The demon cannot abide a particular type of object or substance, or a particular circumstance. This may be a common material such as light, salt or garlic (for weak demons); or a reasonably uncommon one, such as iron horse-shoes, or objects that have been given names, or charms made of rowan wood, for the more powerful demons. The material or circumstance inflicts no actual damage, but should such a thing come into the demon's presence, it must flee; or else spend a Confidence point to remain for two minutes. If it is unable to do either, then a brave or foolhardy soul may be able to strike a bargain with the demon using the advantage he has gained. A demon in the presence of its Abhorrent Material or Circumstance cannot regain spent Might points. This weakness affects demons in both spiritual and physical form, but demons possessing a human are more resistant to their weaknesses, and may make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to remain in the presence of the abhorred material. If the roll is failed, they must either make their host flee, or if this is not possible, end the possession and flee themselves.

Compulsiveness: The demon is compelled to enumerate randomly-scattered objects; if, for example, a jar of beans is scattered in the path of this demon, it must count every one before it can proceed. The objects must be purposefully scattered in sight of the demon to hinder it.

Ordering: The demon has no power over anything which is sealed, counted, measured or tied up. It cannot open sealed vessels, steal grain from a bushel (although it can falsify the weighing in the first place), and so forth. Many demons in Jewish lore have this limitation.

Protected Group: The demon cannot act directly against a particular, reasonably common, group of people. It may not be able to affect children, or men with beards, or female Muslims. None of its supernatural powers work on this group,

and if they face it in combat, it can only defend itself. A person who is not a member of the protected group is safe from the demon if he remains within a defined group of at least 9 others who are protected from the demon. Likewise, 2 vulnerable people can hide within a group with a total size of twenty, and so forth.

Running Water: The demon cannot cross running water. This must be fresh water deriving directly from within the earth — spilled water from a jar will not hinder them.

Vulnerability: A certain substance (see Abhorrent Material for example) causes a Light Wound to the demon merely by touch. The more powerful the demon, the rarer this substance should be. Any weapons made of the material to which the demon is vulnerable inflict a Light Wound to the demon on a successful attack in addition to any damage inflicted as a result of the attack, even if the demon's soak absorbed all the other damage. Light is a common Vulnerability of weak demons.

<span id="demons-and-free-will"></span>
=== Demons and Free Will ===

All demons possess free will as an essential part of their nature, but they have already made the choice for evil (or, as Judaism would have it, are doing God's will by being evil). Because demons are dominated by their evil inclinations, they always act according to their selfish and wicked impulses. Demons are wholly corrupt, so

<span id="religious-limitations-on-demons"></span>
== Religious Limitations on Demons ==

In Christian lands, all demons are forced to abandon their physical form at dawn on Holy Saturday (the day between Good Friday and Easter Day); furthermore, no demon may spend Might points from this point until dusk on Easter Day. This is a reminder of Christ's victory over Satan and subsequent descent into Hell to bring the good news to the souls trapped there.

For Jewish families, if all sins committed in the past year by the adults of the household are atoned and forgiven in the five days between the holy days of Yom Kippur and Sukkot (in September–October), then all demons who are currently affecting their family must flee the household and not return for a year.

No demon can use any Infernal Might to directly affect a Muslim who has completed the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) within the last year. The hajj must be properly and devoutly performed to grant this immunity.

the free choices they make are also wholly corrupt. Demons have no virtues at all, which includes such virtues as patience, courage, and self-control. This means that demons are not good at elaborate long-term plans that provide no immediate pay-off. The mastermind behind such a plan would be a human diabolist, or a faerie. See Chapter 4 of ''Realms of Power: The Infernal'' for more information on using demons in a saga.

Confidence is an aspect of free will, representing the ability of demons to put aside their base impulses and act in a rational manner. Not all demons have Confidence, so some demons are incapable of acting against the dictates of their passions.

<span id="demons-auras-and-regiones"></span>
== Demons, Auras and Regiones ==

Infernal creatures recover spent power more quickly in Infernal auras and regiones. Might Pool usually refreshes at a constant rate such that that all Might would be restored in a day; i.e. Infernal Might / 24 points per hour. In an Infernal aura, it refreshes at a faster rate:

Number of Hours to Restore all Might: 24 – (2 x Infernal Aura)

MIGHT POINTS RESTORED PER HOUR: Infernal Might / Number of hours

Thus a demon with an Infernal Might of 25 resting in an Infernal aura of 6 regains 25 points in 12 hours (approximately 2 points an hour), which is twice as fast as usual.

A demon cannot regenerate any Might in a Divine aura. In all other auras they refresh their Might at the usual rate.

<span id="powers-8"></span>
==== Powers: ====

Form of Woman, 0 points, Init 0, Corpus: Baal-Peor can take the form of a woman, although he cannot use this power to mimic a specific woman. He always chooses a form which will be considered beautiful by the target audience of his schemes.

Noxious Vomit, 1 point, Init +9, Corpus: This power allows Baal-Peor to spray vast amounts of vomit (or, facing the other way, even less pleasant substances) through an area. His vomit is an expression of his spiritual vileness, and does the damage indicated in his combat statistic through corrosion, except to characters with True Faith, whom it cannot touch. The target must make a Strength + Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or be sent flying backwards. Anyone successfully struck by this vileness continues to suffer +3 damage in each round until it is washed off. This damage does not stack for multiple successful attacks.

Swallow Assault, 5 points, Init +3, Terram: Baal-Peor may avoid injury from mundane objects by opening his maw so wide that the attack slides harmlessly down his throat.

Coagulation, 3 points, Init –1, Corpus

Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init –5, Vim: Shamelessness, Gluttony

Shroud the Stench of the Pit, variable points, Init +3, Vim: This power may be used in two manners, both of which affect the expression of other supernatural powers. A demon can conceal the Infernal nature of any other supernatural power, making it appear to be magical or faerie instead. This power is used on an overt expression of power, to prevent spells from recognizing it as infernal in origin. Secondly, it may be used on more subtle powers to remove all stench of the supernatural, making them appear wholly mundane. This power costs Might points equal to the original cost of the power being concealed, or Might points equal to the magnitude of the Infernal effect if it does not cost might to use. This power lasts for as long as the power it is masking.

The Wealth of Nations, 3 points, Init 0, Terram: The demon can summon riches; each use of this power can create wealth equivalent to up to pound of gold for every point of Infernal Might possessed by the demon. This wealth can be of any form — gold, gems, rich tapestries, ivory, etc. — but it is always has intrinsic value, rather than being valuable because of its utility (a roomful of grain, for example). This wealth is not created, it is instead summoned from somewhere else, chosen by the demon, usually for the greatest effect. This might

be a royal treasury on the other side of Europe or the purse of the man standing next to you.

His Master's Voice, variable points, Init +1, Vim: The demon can summon other demons or corrupt beasts to its current location. This costs one Might point for every point of Infernal Might of the being summoned, so is used sparingly. The demon has no control over the demon he has summoned.

Weakness: Running water Vis: 6 pawns of Perdo, in tongue

Appearance: Baal-Peor appears as an immensely fat naked man, with rolls of flab cascading down his body. He is completely hairless, and has a repulsive, snake—like tongue. He wears a serpent wrapped around his girth like a belt, and its head is usually draped over his shoulder.

Baal-Peor (or Belphegor) is a demon of wealth. He creates discord by moving mortal riches in disruptive ways (using the Wealth of Nations power). He gives money to the vulnerable, so that the strong are tempted to take it. He gives the possessions of the powerful to others. This tempts the recipients to keep their stolen treasures, and rouses the powerful to recover them by force.

Baal-Peor was worshipped, in ancient times, less as a wealth-god than as an embodiment of the desire to consume everything and transform it into vileness. His title, &quot;Lord of the Openings&quot; describes him: an unfillable mouth leading to a ceaseless defecation. Priests and pilgrims used the space before his statue as a latrine, as a form of worship. Baal-Peor, it is said, was sent by his masters to seek the truth of rumors that humans lived in marital bliss. He tried to live as a woman, but was so disgusted by marital relations that he fled back to Hell.

Soak: +8

Fatigue levels: OK, 0, -1, -3, -5, Unconscious Wound Penalties: -1 (1-5), -3 (6-10), -5 (11-15),

Incapacitated (16–20)

Abilities: [Area] Lore 6 (trade routes) (Three of these, for the area where he lives, the larger area including it, and the whole of Europe), Artes Liberales 2 (arithmetic), Bargain 10 (trade goods), Charm 5 (merchants), Etiquette 4 (merchants), Folk Ken 8 (merchants), Guile 10 (trading), Intrigue 5 (market politics), Language 6 (trade talk), Latin 6 (ecclesiastical), Profession (merchant) 10 (cloth)

Powers:

Merchant's Blessing, 2 points, Init +0, Mentem: The recipient of this blessing seems trustworthy to most people, and gets a +3 bonus on all social rolls to do with trading. People react to him as if he has an excellent reputation for honesty, fair dealing, and getting high quality goods cheaply. The blessing lasts for a week, unless Bartholomew chooses to renew it.

Merchant's Curse, 1 point, Init +0, Mentem: The inverse of Merchant's Blessing, this curse makes people treat the victim as if he had a strong reputation for dishonesty, cheating and reneging on deals, and selling shoddy goods at inflated prices. He also has a –3 penalty to all social rolls to do with trading. The curse lasts for a week, unless Bartholomew chooses to renew it.

Merchant's Knowledge, O points, automatic, Mentem: Bartholomew knows what someone in receipt of his curses or blessings is doing with their business.

Project Blessing, 2 points, Init +0, Vim: Bartholomew can bless a particular commercial venture, so that chance favors it whenever possible. This results in a very successful trading venture. The blessing only lasts for one day, which isn't normally long enough to have an effect, but Bartholomew can renew the blessing every day, if he so chooses.

Project Curse, 1 point, Init +0, Vim: The inverse of Project Blessing, this effect makes everything that could go wrong, go wrong. It takes at most a month to drive someone to bankruptcy through this power. As for the blessing, the curse only lasts for one day at a time.

Coagulation, 3 points, Init –1, Corpus

Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init –5, Vim: Avarice

Equipment: Fine clothes, a nice house, trade goods. Encumbrance: 0 (0) Weakness: Ordering Vis: 10 pawns of Mentem vis, one in each of his fingers. Infernally tainted. Appearance: Bartholomew appears as an older, but still vigorous, merchant. He is plump, but not fat, and while he never appears positively cheerful, he also never seems angry, or impatient, at least not with other merchants. His clothes are of excellent quality Bartholomew is a well-established and moderately successful merchant in a trading city. He is known for being lazy, but still making an extremely comfortable living from his trade. He also willingly gives advice to other merchants, and they have noticed that following his advice makes them rich, while disregarding it makes them poor. Most people in the city also think that Bartholomew attends church regularly. In fact, being a demon, he has never set foot inside a consecrated building. He has, on the other hand, made substantial donations to the Church, and those donations are well known.

The advice he gives is good business advice in itself, but he normally backs it up with his blessings, at least for a while. If his advice is ignored, he uses his curses to make sure that people suffer. The demonic features of his advice are very, very subtle. Merchants following them often find that they need to work on Sundays, although Bartholomew does not explicitly suggest that, and that they are often away from home on religious holidays, and thus unable to attend their

local church. Further, he gives advice about charity, suggesting that the merchant give money away to reinforce his social standing. He also gives extensive advice on how to calculate how much to give, so that it doesn't cause the merchant financial problems.

This has the effect of making the merchant feel that he is doing a lot of good by giving alms, while removing any actual virtue it has. Anyone following Bartholomew's advice gives only for their own glory, and thus earns no merit. They are sinners, but they don't realize that they are, and thus they do not see the need to repent and reform. Bartholomew's strategy is subtle, but it wins many souls for Hell.

Wound Penalties: -1 (1), -3 (2), -5 (3), Incapacitated (4) Abilities: Athletics 5 (flying), Brawl 6 (dodge), Guile 6

(boasts) Powers:

Make a Liar of the Boastful, 5 points, Init 0, Vim: If this imp hears a boast and expends all of his Might points, he can immediately grant someone nearby an Ability or Power which will contradict that boast, and cause them to use it immediately. Thus if someone proclaims that she is the most beautiful woman in France, Bomburkhan can immediately make someone more beautiful than the boaster. This power must penetrate Magic Resistance to grant the Ability or power to the person, and that talent lasts for 1–10 rounds only (roll a simple die). A physical change, such as the example given above, lasts until the boaster and the target can no longer see each other.

Insignificance, 0 points, Init 0, Vim: No Magic, Infernal or Faerie power can force Bomburkhan to use any of his powers.

Misfortune, 0 points, Init 0, Vim: As an agent of misfortune, the presence of the demon causes the worst luck. In games of sheer chance, the odds always favor the opponent of the imp's target. In other matters where luck is more of a factor than judgement or skill, the target receives a penalty of –2 to any rolls. This misfortune lasts until the demon grows bored or is driven off.

Coagulation, 1 point, Init –1, Corpus

Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init -5, Vim: Boastful

Weakness: Vulnerability (salt) Vis: 1 pawn of Vim, in wings

Appearance: Bomburkhan appears as a jet-black bat, no bigger than a person's hand, but with a pinched and twisted human face protruding from the black fur.

Bomburkhan was released from Hell after the false bravado of a Crusader led to the capture of Jerusalem. Since then he has taken great delight in puncturing the over-inflated egos of the prideful. This demon has an ability that could be exceedingly powerful, depending upon the magnitude of a speaker's self-importance. For example, should a magus declaim &quot;no-one can breach my Parma Magica!&quot;, a nearby grog might suddenly hurl a ''Pilum of Fire'' which slices straight through it! Fortunately for all concerned, this power uses all of Bomburkhan's Might pool, and he grows bored very easily, wandering off once his mischief is done.

Abilities: Leadership 6+2 (children),

Single Weapon 5 (switch)

Powers:

Crushing the Will, 2 points, Init 0, Mentem: This power saps the will and vitality of its target, leaving him listless, less energetic and withdrawn. All Personality Trait rolls suffer a —3 modifier, and the target may not spend Confidence points to increase other rolls. Each use of this power lasts until the victim has slept for at least 6 hours.

Chastise the Disobedient, 0 points, Init +3, Corpus: Every strike of Bordelon's switch inflicts a fearsome sting. Double the wound penalties inflicted by the weapon, although these extra penalties vanish after an hour. Wound penalties caused by any actual wounds she inflicts are healed as normal.

Coagulation, 2 points, Init -1, Corpus

Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init -5, Vim: Shame

Betrayal of the Heart, 2 points, Init 0, Mentem: Bordelon can see into the hearts of mankind and draw forth the most secret thoughts — people's

fears and sins. Each use of this power reveals to the demon one fact about the target to which he would never admit. Truly holy people may be immune to this power, if they have no secrets, no matter how petty.

Whispers Behind the Back, 2 points, Init 0, Mentem: Exactly as the spell Pains of the Perpetual Worry, this power gives the victim a nagging, taunting, painful emotion linked to their secret sins. It is a recurrent sense of anxiety that their secret will be uncovered, and a suspicion that everyone already knows it and is taking about the target behind his back. This power lasts for a month.

Weakness: Protected Group (red-haired women)

Vis: 3 pawns of Mentem, in hair.

Appearance: Bordelon appears as a stern-faced old woman, with hair tied back in such a tight bun that it distorts her face. Her small horns are hidden within this hair. Her skin is mottled with liver-spots, and she wears an austere gown which covers her cloven hooves and forked tail. She affects the demeanor of a stern governess. She carries a switch of willow bound with leather, which she wields with expert ability to inflict the most pain.

Bordelon believes that meekness is a virtue, and that those who strive to better themselves are victims of pride. Her goal is to crush all ambition and prevent those whom she watches from committing the very sin of Satan himself. Bordelon chooses a child early on in his life, and becomes his personal tormentor (granting the Story Flaw Plagued by a Demon). The child soon learns that the demon's periodic appearances are more frequent whenever

he tries to distinguish himself from his peers, so her victims tend to become withdrawn, unambitious and meek. Whenever her victim acts in a way that would grant a Confidence point due to increased selfworth, he can expect a visit from Bordelon to punish

the presumption.

Abilities: Arabic 5 (understanding)*, Folk Ken 3 (travelers), Theology: Islam 3 (jinn), Survival 5 (desert), Taklamakan Lore 5 (legends), Wilderness Sense 2 (weather)

\* Represents level of understanding as the spirit is Mute.

Delusion of the Desert, 1 or 5 points, Init +3, Imaginem: This evil spirit can create illusions of a lost traveler's companions or a welcoming oasis, only to launch itself in fury at an unsuspecting victim. Alternatively it can create images of itself as a humanoid sandstorm with glowing fiery eyes in order to terrify its victims prior to their deaths. A minor illusion which affects an Individual amount of material (such as the demon itself) costs one point; a larger illusion which fills a room costs five points. These visions always have a flaw, however (they smell wrong, can only be seen by one target, etc.).

Elemental Control of Wind, variable points, Init +1; Auram: The buran has control over the winds of nature, which it uses to wreak destruction on the desert fringes. It may create any Creo, Muto, or Rego effect appropriate to Auram, at a cost of 1 Might Point per magnitude of effect. The demon cannot create any effect with a level greater than its Infernal Might, nor duplicate Ritual effects.

Recalcitrance, 0 points, Init constant, Vim: Any attempt to control (but not destroy) the buran with any form of Supernatural Power (magical, Divine, or otherwise) treats the demon's Might as if it were 150% its actual Might, or otherwise has its Ease Factor increased by 50%. For example, a Circular Ward Against Demons of 38th level is needed to stop this demon.

Weaknesses: Protected Group (individuals that invoke the Bismillah invocation)

Vis: 5 pawns of Auram vis prava, left behind as black sand when dispersed.

Appearance: Usually manifests as a giant shapeless vortex of raging black sand using its Auram powers. To those with Second Sight, a giant humanoid shadow can be discerned within the sandstorm.

This wild desert storm spirit, or buran, once plagued the small village of Yenghissar along the route to Khashgar, bringing devastation to the crops and herd animals every seven years. It is now bound by an Infernally-aligned sahir using the Goetic Art of Binding (see ''Realms of Power: The Infernal'', page 117). A speechless, destructive force of fury incarnate, it rages to be released and constantly strives to create elemental havoc around the thoughtless sahir who has trapped it within his ancestral sword.

Unlike many other corrupt jinn, the buran lacks the Coagulation and Obsession powers common to most demons and is an insubstantial spirit, unable to affect the physical world except through its magic. It is an example of an

Infernal storm spirit likely to be found in the Taklamakan Desert, although much stronger and less powerful creatures also exist (see ''The Cradle and the Crescent'', Chapter 9: On the Silk Road and Beyond...). Many travelers' tales tell of companions fallen behind who are tempted off the track by the illusions created by these demons.

He may create any Creo, Muto or Rego effect appropriate to Terram, at a cost of 1 might point per magnitude of effect. The demon cannot create any effect with a level greater than his Infernal Might, nor duplicate Ritual effects. He prefers effects such as Wielding the Invisible Sling and Rusted Decay of Ten-Score Years.

Born of Rock, 0 points, Init 0, Terram: The body of this demon is made from solid rock. This makes it exceedingly heavy and almost impossible to harm with mundane means.

Death's Vengeance, 0 points, Init +10, Terram: Upon death, this demon's body explodes, sending

shards of debris up to 20 paces in all directions. Treat this as a physical attack against all within range that can be dodged but not otherwise defended against. The Attack Bonus is +12, and the Damage is +15.

Coagulation, 1 point, Init -1, Corpus

Obsession, 1 to 3 points, Init -5, Vim. Cowardice

Recalcitrance, O points, Init constant, Vim: Any attempt to control (but not destroy) the demon with any form of supernatural power (Magical, Divine or otherwise) treats the demon's Might as if it were one and a half times its actual Might, or otherwise has its Ease Factor increased by 50%. For example, a Circular Ward Against Demons of 30th level is needed to stop Fimus.

Weakness: Abhorrent Material (Cinnamon)

Vis: 2 pawns of Terram, in eye.

Appearance: Fimus appears as an immense man apparently put together out of boulders. He has but one eye, in the center of his forehead. He carries an immense cudgel made out of a stalagmite.

Fimus is but one of many brother-demons (all with the same name); their mother produces more every time she evacuates her bowels. He and his brothers are popular foot-soldiers and shocktroops used by other demons, because they are effective warriors, and too stupid to effectively entertain rebellious thoughts. Each of the brothers has a different Abhorrent Material, depending upon what their mother had been eating prior to their birth.

Vis: 2 pawns of Muto in his heart (Infernally tainted) Appearance: Michael appears as he needs to for his latest role. As a demon, he doesn't need, nor does he have, a 'natural' form.

Michael (he likes taking the name of a famous angel) is a minor demon who tempts people to wrath. He sets up elaborate, painful, and humiliating practical jokes, and makes sure that he is seen in the form of one of the victim's friends while doing so. If possible, he ensures that the victim sees him, in the form of the friend, laughing at their misfortune before running away.

He normally stays around to watch the resulting confrontation, because if it isn't heated enough he sets up another, even more hurtful, joke. He is especially happy if both friends become angry, and the friendship is ruined. Since both parties feel that the other was unreasonable, sometimes they can nurse their anger for years, which is exactly what Michael wants.

While Michael's jokes are normally painful and humiliating, they are almost never fatal. He wants people to sin so that they damn their souls, not die and possibly go to Heaven.

Calm Person, 1 point, Init +18, Mentem: Makes the target person unnaturally calm about talking to a large wolf. It doesn't lessen their fear, just the sense that it is something they should act on immediately.

Dominate Wolves, O points, Init +18, Animal: Polandrus can establish absolute control over any wolf. The wolf doesn't like it, but Polandrus doesn't care. This power applies to mundane wolves, wolves with Might scores, and to characters who can naturally take the form of a wolf, including shapechangers, lycanthropes, skinchangers, and Bjornaer with wolf heartbeasts, but not including magi who change using spells. Once established, the domination lasts until Polandrus decides to drop it, the dominated wolf enters a Dominion aura of level 3 or higher, or someone dispels the power.

Vis: 1 pawn of Animal in each of four large canine teeth, all Infernally tainted.

Appearance: An extremely large, jet black wolf, with red eves.

Polandrus targets livestock farmers. He dominates a few wolves, and then kills some livestock, making sure that someone sees the wolves do it. A little later, he confronts the peasant in question, offering to ensure that the wolves do not attack for a week if the farmer does something innocuous, such as not wear a particular tunic. Polandrus comes back every week, and the requirements gradually become sinful, and more and more heinous. By the end, the wolf relies more on the threat to expose the farmer's deeds than on the threat to the livestock

Polandrus is unnaturally fast in combat, much more so than in normal situations. However, he never attacks people unless he is attacked first.

<span id="corrupt-beasts"></span>
== Corrupt Beasts ==

Corrupt beasts can come about in a number of different ways. Some are mundane beasts corrupted directly by the power of a demon, while others are born corrupt after a coupling between a demon and a beast. Creatures that dwell in an Infernal aura become corrupted by the very nature of the area; this may only become apparent in the offspring of animals moving into a weak Infernal aura, but is a result of Infernal Warping in stronger auras. Certain Infernal auras may corrupt a creature overnight. Finally, diabolists and Infernalists may have the power to create corrupt beasts, either intentionally or as an unintended side effect of their powers.

To create the game statistics of a Corrupt Beast, start with the statistics of a mundane beast, and apply the Corrupted Beast Flaw. Balance this Flaw with a Virtue, or, if the beast has been corrupted for a long time, or was born in this state, apply more Flaws to acquire further Virtues. Virtues and Flaws for Corrupted Beasts may only be chosen from the accompanying list. The corpse of a corrupted beast typically contains one pawn of vis for each five points of Might it possessed.

<span id="corrupted-beast"></span>
==== CORRUPTED BEAST ====

Minor Supernatural Flaw, animals only

The creature has been corrupted by Infernal power, and has acquired an Infernal Might of 5. The negative side of its character is brought to the fore, and it acquires one sinful Personality Trait at +6, such as Violent, Gluttonous or Lustful. As part of the corruption, the beast acquires some sort of disgusting or repellent appearance, decreasing its Presence to -6. However, should the animal make any attempt to scare or intimidate an opponent, this should be treated as a Presence of +6. Despite

this deformity, it is possible (although difficult) to pass the animal off as a natural member of its species. Finally, the creature acquires the Tainted with Evil Flaw which affects the reactions of both humans and other animals towards it. Corrupted Beasts do not react negatively to The Gift.

<span id="demonic-weakness"></span>
==== DEMONIC WEAKNESS ====

Minor Supernatural Flaw, Corrupted Beasts only The beast has a weakness similar to that of a demon. Corrupt Beasts cannot have the Ordering or Compulsion Weaknesses.

<span id="horrifying-appearance"></span>
==== HORRIFYING APPEARANCE ====

Major Supernatural Flaw, Corrupted Beasts only The creature is hideously deformed in some way, and this deformity causes a major hindrance to its life. These deformities may have some minor side benefit (a creature without a skeleton can seep through cracks, for example), but prevent the animal from ever being passed off as a member of\nits original species.

<span id="greater-infernal-power"></span>
==== GREATER INFERNAL POWER ====

Major Supernatural Virtue, Corrupted Beasts only Choosing this Virtue adds 5 to the Infernal Might of the Corrupt Beast. The creature has an Infernal Power which it may activate by spending points from\nits Might Pool. Design the effect as if it were a Hermetic spell, or an Infernal Power, if you have Realms of Power. The Infernal. The level of effect cannot\nexceed the Corrupted Beast's (Infernal Might + 10).

<span id="example-porrifying-appearances"></span>
== Example Porrifying Appearances ==

A pair of huge but useless wings which hang limply at the sides of the creature's body.

Transparent skin, so that its organs can be seen pulsating within the flesh.

A snake's body instead of hindquarters, forcing the creature to move with a combined crawl and slither.

No internal skeleton. The beast can force itself into its original form for short periods, but soon collapses into a puddle of hair, teeth and claws, oozing slowly along the ground.

A head at each end of the body, or in the center of the back.

A Greater Power typically costs its magnitude in Might points to activate, and has an Init bonus equal to Qik + magnitude. A power is a Greater Infernal Power if it requires a Penetration total to work. Corrupt Beasts may have this Virtue more than once, each for a different power. Infernal Might increases for each Power acquired.

<span id="lesser-infernal-power"></span>
==== Lesser Infernal Power ====

Minor Supernatural Virtue, Corrupted Beasts only Choosing this Virtue adds 2 to the Infernal Might of the Corrupt Beast. The creature has an Infernal Power which either affects it constantly or may be activated by spending points from its Might Pool. Design the effect as if it were a Hermetic spell, or an Infernal Power if you have Realms of Power: The Infernal, but adjust the level for Constant Effect or Maintaining Concentration if appropriate (ignoring other Effect Modifications). The level of effect cannot exceed the Corrupted Beast's Infernal Might. A Minor power typically costs 0-2 Might points to activate, and has an Init bonus equal to magnitude. A Lesser Infernal Power cannot have a Penetration Total; if the power would have to exceed the Magic Resistance of a target to operate (even if they do not have any Magic Resistance), then it is a Greater Power instead. Corrupt Beasts may have this Virtue more than once, each for a different power. Infernal Might increases for each Power acquired.

Powers:

The Unimpeded Traveler, 0 points, Init +1, Animal: This steed is not impeded by poor terrain, and may move at maximum speed along even the poorest of roads, achieving 30 miles a day. It may even cross open water and chasms, unsupported by ground, but can do this only at a trotting pace.

Vis: 2 pawns of Animal, in hooves.

Appearance: A fearsome black stallion with bloodshot eyes, fangs in its mouth, and hooves of iron.

This horse is one of three created by an Infernalist magus in a tribunal at the fringes of the Order by repeated applications of a tainted version of ''Steed of Vengeance'' (Muto Animal Level 35). There were many failures before he successfully created these three corrupted beasts. Because the spell is well-known, he is able to use the steeds in front of other magi with impunity.

<span id="powers-9"></span>
==== Powers: ====

Spit Fire, 4 points, Init +6, Ignem: The hound may spit a bolt of fire at its opponents, which does +15 damage to the individual it hits. The

creature may bite one opponent and spit fire at another in the same round.

Vis: 2 pawns of Vim, one in each head.

Appearance: This huge dog has two slavering heads protruding from its massive shoulders. The two heads are cursed with independent minds which clearly hate each other and would like nothing more than to bite the other; it is only because the hound's necks are too short that it cannot. The dog is covered in gray fur in the few areas which are not affected by mange, which has left patches of puffy, purulent red flesh.

This corrupted beast was created by a diabolist to be a guard for his sanctum. He controls it with an Infernal charm, but is fearful of the day that this charm fails, for he knows that the dog hates him.

<span id="creatures-of-the-divine"></span>
= Creatures of the Divine =

reatures with Divine Might use the normal rules for determining Magic Resistance, Penetration, and whether their powers can be dispelled.

Although they are acting on behalf of God, they are not direct interventions by the deity, and thus are not omnipotent.

Creatures with Divine Might cannot have True Faith. That blessing is limited to beings who are not already part of the Divine Realm.

Creatures with Divine Might are never bothered by The Gift. They judge people based on their

188

actions and hearts, not on the powers that they might have. If you decide that magic is inherently sinful, they are inclined against magi, but because of their sins, not because of The Gift. Specific Flaws (such as Offensive to Divine Beings and Unbearable to Divine Beings) that modify or simulate the effects of The Gift may cause creatures with Divine Might to react negatively to the character with the Flaw, although Magical Air does not. Such Flaws, and encounters, are not common enough for anyone in Mythic Europe to wonder why.

<span id="angelic-powers"></span>
=== Angelic Powers ===

All angels possess the following powers:

Angelic Mantle, 2 points, +12, Corpus: Angels use this power to manifest in the mundane world and appear to take on mortal flesh. In reality, this form is entirely formed from their intellect, but appears and acts exactly like real flesh. While in this &quot;material&quot; form, they must follow the mundane world's natural laws, and so are limited, with Characteristic and Soak scores, and Fatigue and Wound levels. Although angels are genderless, their Mantles normally do have a gender; while in their Mantle, angels may breed, and sire or bear children (although no angel has done so since the flood), although they do not

Enfolding, 2 or 10 points, +10, Vim: When the pious are in danger or torment, the angel may grant them comfort, imparting a moment of peace and mercy. This power renders the target's soul wholly safe and protected for a short time. While Enfolded the target's soul (and mind) may not be targeted by any supernatural power of any kind. This power only lasts for a few scant moments, but for the target it is timeless and can seem to stretch to a lifetime. An angel may also Enfold a person's body (costing 10 Might points), rendering them completely invulnerable to magic, pain, damage, fatigue, wounds, or death, although this power only lasts for a very short period of time (no longer than one combat round). This power is most often used on a member of the faithful who is about to be martyred or suffer terribly.

Envisioning, 1 or 5 points, +0, Mentem: This power allows angels to appear in the dreams of a target, or even while awake, and impart a Divine message. This is different to a miraculous vision, which occurs through direct Divine agency. An Envisioning that takes place while the target is awake costs five points and may seem like a daydream, or a vivid or frightening vision, depending on what message the angel intends. Anyone may be the target of Envisioning, pious and impious, pagan and infernalist. Envisioning may occur over any distance.

More approachable and intellectually-minded than his fellows, the Archangel Gabriel (Jibril or Jabra'il in Islam) is the chief messenger of God, best known for his teaching of the prophet Daniel, his announcing of the incarnation of Christ to the Virgin Mary and his bringing of the revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad, for whom he also acted as a constant counsellor. He may be encountered by characters who are seeking wisdom, particularly if this wisdom is of a religious nature. He is most likely to be encountered in the form described here; in his natural form he is a 600-winged figure who is large enough to stand astride the horizon.

Kolazonta is one of the angels tasked by the lord to chastise His faithful for their failings, and as such he is a servant of Uriel, the Angel of Punishment. Kolazonta was the angel who brought the plague upon the Israelites (in Numbers 16:46–50) for rebelling against Moses. Aaron defeated Kolazonta after Moses told him the punishment was lifted. Kolazonta is a grim angel who executes the chastisement of the Lord without fear or favor. He is often present amidst armies or cities under siege, waiting for the Lord's command to inflict a plague upon the sinful.

...our father Aaron, armed with the censer, ran through the multitude of the people and conquered the fiery angel...

Lupersus has been sent by God to guard a holy hermit, provide him with food, and, occasionally, lead those in need of advice to the hermit who can provide it. He cannot speak, and has no wish to do so. While his main focus is on the hermit, Lupersus is generally compassionate, and helps those in trouble whom he finds within his range. Sometimes he leads them to safety, but most people do not trust a wolf. In those cases, he chases them to safety. Lupersus is not an angel, but rather a divine creature, and does not have the powers shared by all angels.

&quot;As I was unable to walk, I climbed the mountain on horseback, while its slopes were all covered with pieces of stone and pebbles which slipped backwards under the feet of the horse every time its hoofs struck them [...] It slipped backward, with the pebbles and chips of stone sliding under it, and fell. So I dismounted, assisted the horse to its feet and stopped, unable to move. At that moment a man came down to me from the mountain and held me by the hand, my other hand holding the pack horse, until he got me to the summit.

Seferiel is an angel with special responsibility for Hermetic magi. Most of the time, he seeks to draw them closer to God, but sometimes he acts as the instrument of God's vengeance against those who are particularly wicked. His attitude depends slightly on whether magic is

inherently sinful in your saga, his suggested courses of action depend on this more strongly. However, either way he likes Hermetic magi, in general, and finds them fascinating people. He often pretends to be a magus in order to get to know people better, and find out what they are really like.

Seferiel sometimes takes an interest in a particular magus, one whom he sees has great potential, and is a suitable antagonist for the Plagued by Angel Story Flaw. His divinely-appointed mission is, however, to the Order as a whole, and he travels across Europe to bring God's message to as many magi as possible.

<span id="xiv-mythic-europe"></span>
== XIV. Mythic Europe ==

he official setting for Ars

Magica is Mythic Europe, a world very like the Middle Ages of our world, but with magic. For many people, this setting is

a large part of the fun of the game. You can 'change history', or at least 'visit' historical places. When you save a country from demons, you've saved France, not some imaginary land. It's also possible to actually visit the place where your saga is set, although that's easier for European players.

However, some players and storyguides can find this a little intimidating. There is no need for this. The most important thing to remember is that it is a game: it is supposed to be fun. If historical accuracy is spoiling your fun, you need less of it. Any way you enjoy playing the game counts as playing it 'properly'. The second thing to remember is that this chapter contains all the history you need to play the game in Mythic Europe. There is, of course, a lot more history out there, but none of it is necessary for play.

The reason for the historical setting is that it is fun to pretend that you are involved in history. If that isn't fun for your troupe, you should consider playing in a non-historical setting (see page 531).

<span id="making-it-inistorical"></span>
== Making it Inistorical ==

f you are playing a historical roleplaying game, you want the stories to feel historical. You should not attempt to do this by avoiding errors, because

mood is better set by positive, obvious features of the story, rather than by omissions. Thus, you should include historical features and make them an important part of the story.

Some aspects of this are both easy and obvious. There are castles, and knights riding around in armor. However, these features of the environment do not distinguish Mythic Europe from many generic fantasy settings. If you want the game to feel properly medieval, rather than vaguely medieval, you need to do a bit more.

One possibility is to introduce known historical figures. The main problem with this is that most players will only have heard of the most famous medieval figures, generally kings and saints, and it can spoil suspension of disbelief if they show up all the time. On the other hand, if your saga is set in northern Italy a little before the canonical date it is entirely realistic to have St Francis of Assisi wander past every so often. Still, it is unwise to rely on famous medieval people entirely. If your players have more background knowledge on the period, less famous figures might work just as well, and you could make several historical figures into recurring NPCs.

<span id="in-fun-history"></span>
== In-Fun history ==

Medieval European society was not a liberal, tolerant, or pleasant place to live. It was thoroughly misogynist and patriarchal, and democracy was generally regarded as an evil custom that would destroy society. While the period is rightly notorious for its antisemitism, it is important to remember that Judaism was the most tolerated minority religion in almost all areas covered by Ars Magica. We have not chosen the game's setting because we think it is a society that is worth emulating, or one in which we would like to live.

If your troupe finds medieval society sufficiently offputting, you might want to play in a non-historical setting. On the other hand, you might like the general idea, but find particular elements unpalatable. In that case, there is no problem with glossing over or removing those features of medieval society. If you want the Church to silently tolerate surviving pagan cults in rural villages, go for it. That could have relatively little impact, without straining suspension of disbelief too much. If you want to introduce gender equality you will have to do more work, but it might be as simple as declaring that England is currently ruled by Queen Henrietta III, rather than King Henry III.

On the other hand, you might enjoy playing characters who have to face the challenges created by an oppressive culture. It can be a lot of fun to play the resistance, as the popularity of a certain fictional universe including knights with shining swords proves. The Order of Hermes is deliberately designed to be anachronistic and fundamentally tolerant, so that your troupe's home covenant can be as liberal as you like, if you would have more fun with a safe home base for your characters.

The material published for Ars Magica 5th Edition stays close to the facts about medieval society, but your troupe does not have to. Discuss what you would, collectively, find most fun, and develop that consensus as you play so that everyone enjoys playing in the game world, even if they would certainly not want to live there.

A second possibility is to have the characters turn up at famous historical events. This suffers from some of the same problems as using historical characters, and has an additional potential problem. If you decide that you want the course of history in your saga to match the course of recorded history, you will have to stop the player characters changing anything. This is, in general, a bad way to write stories.

Another approach is to make distinctively medieval things central to a story. This is much easier than it sounds, for two reasons. First, you only need to find out one thing for each story. For example, you might learn that medieval people went on frequent pilgrimages to saints' tombs, and then build a story around a pilgrimage. You don't need to know about the rest of the cult of saints, because those other aspects do not matter to your story. Second, by putting something obviously medieval on center stage, you draw attention to that, and away from the areas where you are making things up as you go along.

You can use any area of medieval culture for this, but you should pick something that you find independently interesting. Once you have found an interesting fact, you have to work it into a story. This does not mean that the thing should turn up, and that you then lecture the players about it. Instead, the course of the story should depend, in some way, on the thing that you have discovered.

Some discoveries are easier to incorporate than others. For example, there was a significant tendency for people to try to steal relics from shrines, so that they could have the holiness for

themselves. This is easy to incorporate, the story can just be about a relic thief, and the NPCs simply mention that such thefts are not uncommon. Similarly, features of the laws and systems of justice can easily be worked into a story centered around a court case.

It seems harder to incorporate details of medieval diet into a story, but it is not impossible. For example, the nobility ate meat with nearly every meal, as a sign of status. So, have a nobleman arrange to visit the covenant, and then have an enemy curse the covenant so that their meat stocks all turn rotten, as does any new meat they bring in. If the covenant cannot lift the curse, they will have to feed the nobleman vegetables, and he will be insulted.

For some aspects of social history, the best way to incorporate them is to create an NPC around that fact, and then have the NPC play a central role in at least one story. For example, it was common for widows to take over and continue their husbands' businesses, but many businessmen regarded such women with a degree of hostility. A widow could, therefore, seek the covenant's help.

A final option is to spend some time reading medieval legends and stories, and then to create stories based on them. Many medieval legends are available in inexpensive English translations, and some are extremely easy to convert into stories.

The main body of this chapter, and other Ars Magica products, contain a large number of such aspects of medieval history, along with explicit suggestions for how to turn them into stories. It is entirely possible to create a saga with a very

<span id="medieval-physics"></span>
== Medieval Physics ==

Modern science is not true of Mythic Europe. The world is a sphere, but it is stationary at the center of the universe, and the stars and planets, including the Sun, are carried around it on great spheres. The lowest of these, the Lunar Sphere, is also the limit of the power of Hermetic magic. There are differences at a more immediate level, as well. Diseases are caused by imbalances in the four humors, not by infectious micro-organisms. An object in motion tends to come to a halt unless a force makes it continue moving. Worms and flies arise spontaneously from nonliving matter. These questions are discussed in detail in Art &amp; Academe, which also provides rules for medicine and the feats of experimental philosophers.

medieval tone without buying any books that are not part of the Ars Magica line.

Some storyguides might worry that their players will not appreciate just how medieval some of the things they incorporate are, but this is unlikely to be a problem. If the players know that you are trying to incorporate genuine medieval history, they are likely to take it on trust that the person they have just met had real medieval counterparts, and thus when the events of the saga differ from the assumptions of generic medieval fantasy they will know that this is because of genuine historical flavor.

In addition, it is not at all uncommon for players of Ars Magica to start reading a bit about the Middle Ages. If your players do so, they will find that they come across things that have already featured in the saga. This will impress them with your erudition, and with the historical feel that the game has.

<span id="the-order-of-hermes"></span>
== The Order of Hermes ==

The Order of Hermes is completely ahistorical. It has no basis whatsoever in medieval history or myth. (The magical traditions described in supplements such as ''Rival Magic'' and ''Hedge Magic Revised Edition'' are, in many cases, much more closely grounded in medieval beliefs.) Its magi are also unbelievably powerful. Why does the rest of Mythic Europe look so similar to the real world?

The real answer is &quot;because we want to play a game about powerful wizards in medieval Europe&quot;. We therefore gloss over inconsistencies. The Code of Hermes is designed to help with suspension of disbelief on this point, and it is reasonable for players to simply assume that it successfully stops magi from interfering and changing the course of history.

Of course, there is nothing to stop you from allowing the player magi in your saga to make major changes, and indeed there is a whole supplement, ''Transforming Mythic Europe'', devoted to ways in which they can do exactly that.

<span id="pieces-of-history"></span>
== Pieces of History ==

he following sections cover the Mythic European setting, concentrating on the more historical, or historically legendary, aspects. The Realms

and Bestiary chapters provide some more ideas on the purely fantastic aspects of the setting. This is not a history text. It is generalized to the point that nothing in this section was exactly true of any part of medieval Europe, and there are some places where the generalizations didn't apply at all. If you want more specific and accurate history for a particular area, there are several Tribunal books available for '''Ars Magica''' 5th Edition.

Further, this is not a narrative history of medieval Europe. Such things are easily available in encyclopedias, if you want to read them. However, the sorts of details that are useful for adding historical flavor to a role-playing game are not the sorts of details that are necessarily easy to find.

The information given in this section is most accurate for 1220, the 'official' date for Ars Magica. Using it will give your saga the feel of something happening between about 1000 and 1400, which is likely to be good enough to most troupes.

<span id="the-church-1"></span>
== The Church ==

The Church is probably the quickest and easiest way to give medieval flavor to your saga. Christianity influenced every aspect of life in medieval Europe in a way that's hard to even imagine today, and does not feature in most fantasy settings. Almost everybody, including most Hermetic magi, is a Christian, and the overwhelming majority of Christians believe that the Church is essential to their religion.

The fact that the medieval Church is, after some changes, still around as the Roman Catholic Church means that you have to be a bit careful about offending people when using it in your sagas. Over its history the Church, both clergy and laity, has had periods when it was more true to Christian ideals, and periods when it was less so, and at all periods members of the Church have run the full gamut from sinners to saints. You will need to decide what sort of atmosphere prevails in your game, although you should keep in mind that, unless you change the game mechanics, the Church is backed by the Divine, which puts limits on how corrupt it can be. In the end, the best way to avoid giving offense is probably to portray rounded characters, rather than stereotypes at either extreme.

Much more information about the Church is available in ''The Church''.

<span id="doctrine"></span>
==== Doctrine ====

There is one God, eternal and unchanging, who created the world from nothing and sustains it from moment to moment. This God is three persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Son became a human being as Jesus Christ, an event called the Incarnation, which is considered the most important event in history. Jesus Christ died on the cross, the Crucifixion, and by his death paid the penalty for all the sins committed by human beings. On the third day, he rose from the dead, in the Resurrection, and forty days later he ascended to heaven.

The information in this chapter is focused on Western Europe — the region ruled by Christians who recognised the Pope as the head of the Church on Earth. This is a diverse area already, but there is a lot more to Mythic Europe, and supplements have covered it in more detail. Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition includes more information on Christianity, and also on Islam and Judaism. Against the Dark and The Sundered Eagle offer information about Eastern Europe, and the Orthodox Church.

<span id="magic-and-sin"></span>
== Magic and Sin ==

One question that is not decided by the core rules of '''Ars Magica''' is whether magic is sinful in itself. It is clear that it can be used for sinful purposes, and lends itself well to all seven deadly sins, but it can also be used for good ends. If magic is inherently sinful, casting a spell is sinful no matter what the purpose.

The choice you make here affects the possible relationships between the magi and the Divine. If magic is inherently sinful, saints and angels will always encourage magi to abandon it. This creates a strong tension, and so works best if interactions with the Church are rare. It does not mean that the Divine is always hostile, as the world is full of sinners, and magic, in itself, is not necessarily a particularly serious sin.

If magic is not inherently sinful, magic could have close, and good, relations with the Church, saints, and angels, with occasional concerns over sins the magic committed using magic. In this case, giving up magic, whether temporarily or permanently, is a suitable penance in itself; giving up a sin can never be a penance, because it is required anyway.

stain, and fits a person to receive God's grace, which grants the ability to do good.

Good acts are those which accord with God's will, and tend to His glory, while evil acts are those which do not. The seven deadly sins are the basic roots of almost all sins committed by human beings, and the Church warns against them in particular. They are Avarice, Envy, Greed, Lust, Pride, Sloth, and Wrath. On the other side, there are the three theological virtues: Faith, Hope, and Love, and the greatest of these is Love.

All humans have an immortal soul, created at some point before birth. (In 1220, theologians still disagree about when.) After death, the soul is judged by God. Those who die perfect, having done penance for all their sins, pass directly into heaven. Those who die penitent, but not yet perfect, pass to purgatory, where they do penance after death for all those sins remaining. Those who die impenitent are condemned to hell for eternity.

<span id="-5"></span>

<span id="sacraments"></span>
=== Sacraments ===

The life of the Church is structured around the seven sacraments. Most of these mark important stages of life, but the most important of the sacraments, the Mass, is devoted solely to man's relationship with God.

Baptism is the first of the sacraments. It involves literally or symbolically immersing someone in water, while announcing that you are baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Baptism washes away the stain of original sin, and is generally essential for salvation. Baptism can be performed by anyone, even a non-Christian, and even someone who gets the process wrong, as long as they intend to be performing a Christian baptism.

In 1220 there is theological uncertainty as to the fate of babies who die unbaptized, so the Church has many procedures in place to ensure that children are baptized as soon as possible after birth. Baptism should be performed by a priest if at all possible, but in an emergency anyone, as noted above, may do it. As a result, Jews are just about the only unbaptized people in Mythic Europe.

Confirmation marks a person's desire to be united with the Church on Earth, when he re-affirms

the promises made on his behalf at baptism. This is supposed to take place at the age of reason, seven years old, but often does not. Confirmation can only be administered by a bishop or a priest specially designated as his representative, and, ideally, only after examining the candidate to ensure that he understands the Christian faith. These requirements make it hard for most medieval people to get a proper confirmation, so there are a substantial number of people who have never been confirmed. In particular, most Christian magi have not been, unless they or their parens are particularly pious.

Marriage marks the start of a family, and is another sacrament that doesn't need any Church representative. A man and a woman marry by declaring that they are married to each other, as long as they are both old enough (over twelve for a woman, fourteen for a man), neither is already married, and they are not too closely related. Marriage is for life, and cannot be dissolved. The Pope occasionally issues annulments, but these merely recognize that the marriage never actually took place.

Although no ceremony is required for marriage, the Church strongly encourages people to have a public ceremony involving a priest. Apart from anything else, this helps to head off later arguments over whether there really was a marriage. It would be extremely rare for a couple to get married with no ceremony or celebration at all.

Extreme Unction is the final sacrament, given just before death. For this reason, it draws the most ambiguous attitude of any sacrament. While it is generally believed to ease the passage to heaven, many people believe that, if you have received it, you are dead to the world in some sense, and must enter a monastery if you recover (see the Viaticarus Flaw, page 150). Similarly, people are often reluctant to receive it, as that means admitting that they are about to die, and Church doctrine is absolutely clear that it is not necessary for salvation. Extreme Unction can only be administered by a priest.

Ordination is the sacrament that turns a man into a priest, or other member of orders. There are two main classes of orders: minor orders, and major orders. The minor orders are doorkeeper, lector, exorcist, and acolyte. The major, or holy, orders, are sub-deacon, deacon, priest, and bishop. Men in holy orders may not marry, or have a living wife, whereas men in minor orders are much less restricted. All ordained men take the tonsure, which involves shaving the crown of the head, leaving a ring of hair.

Penance is the sacrament that responds to sin. Christians are required to confess all their sins to a priest, who then assigns a penance if he is convinced that the sinner has truly repented. The penance is something of some difficulty, which the penitent sinner performs to show that his repentance is genuine. It does not purchase forgiveness; that was bought by Christ's death. Instead, it allows the penitent to renew his respect

<span id="hermetic-magic-and-the-sacraments"></span>
== hermetic Magic and the Sacraments ==

Magi can observe the supernatural effects of the Sacraments, and it is common knowledge within the Order that the Sacraments are supernatural Divine powers. For example, a baptismal name cannot be used as a Sympathetic Connection to aid Penetration (unlike a birth name), Mass does indeed change simple bread and wine into something Divine, and bodies that have received Extreme Unction cannot be affected by magic for three days.

Due to this overwhelming evidence of the Divine, most magi believe in the existence of God, and many would describe themselves as Christians. However, even a magus who identifies himself as Christian would almost certainly be considered by the Church to have a heretical view of the world, colored as it will be by the magus' knowledge of the supernatural.

<span id="aaaaaaaaaa"></span>
== AAAAAAAAAA ==

for God in a concrete way. Common penances involve saying a certain number of prayers or psalms, giving charity or helping the poor in some other way, or going on a pilgrimage to a shrine, at a distance depending on the severity of the sin.

Priests are not allowed to mention what they hear in confession to anyone, not even their superiors in the Church. The contents of confession are between the priest, the penitent, and God.

In the Mass, God Himself becomes manifest in bread and wine, which is shared with the congregation. In most of Europe, the laity now only receive the bread, but in a few places the custom of receiving both bread and wine persists. The bread becomes the body of Christ, known as the Host, and the wine becomes His Blood, so that the Mass symbolizes the sacrifice of Christ for the salvation of all believers, and the participation of all believers in that sacrifice.

Actually receiving the bread is known as taking communion, and a person must confess and do penance before doing so. (For large penances, a sincere intent to complete it suffices.) As a result, most people only take communion once a year, at Easter, although they attend the service most weeks.

Because the consecrated bread and wine are extremely holy, they must be consumed completely during the service, with great care taken not to spill or drop any.

<span id="game-use-sacraments"></span>
=== Game Use: Sacraments ===

The sacraments are as central a part of modern Catholicism, and many other contemporary varieties of Christianity, as they were of the medieval Church. Thus, a certain degree of care should be taken to avoid offending people. That said, they are a central part of medieval life, and thus make good stories.

A number of covenfolk decide that they want to be confirmed, living at the covenant, they have previously had no opportunity. This means taking them to the bishop, and getting them through the catechism without painting the covenant as a hive of heretics.

A moderately pious magus decides to confess and take communion after several lapsed years. The (knowledgeable) confessor assigns a pilgrimage to a distant shrine, without using magic at all, as a penance.

The covenfolk find out that Hermetic magic, or, indeed, any other magic, is completely incapable of affecting the Host in any way. They form a fraternity devoted to honoring the Host as God's presence on Earth. (In 1220, this is unusual, but not heretical. Later, it becomes common and absolutely orthodox.)

Someone born at the covenant becomes deeply pious, but some power seems to be driving him out of churches, and he has ominous warning dreams in which he is overwhelmed by great waves. It turns out that he was never baptized, and the dreams are to encourage him to do so.

The unbaptized pious character dies without working out the problem. After his death, a close friend has visions revealing that he is damned to hell, and why, warning them to ensure that everyone is baptized. This could launch a quest for a way to baptize the character posthumously. (This has happened before. At the earnest request of Pope Gregory the Great, later a saint, God allowed the Roman Emperor Trajan to be saved after death. But God did warn the Pope not to ask such things again.)

<span id="saints"></span>
==== Saints ====

Saints are people who served God faithfully when alive, and have now died and joined the Church Triumphant in heaven. (Living Christians are often called the Church Militant, as they must still fight temptation and the wiles of the devil.) Strictly speaking, angels are not saints, as they are not and never were human, but the archangels Michael and Gabriel are often treated as saints.

The importance of saints for living Christians is that they are willing to intercede with God on behalf of the living, and while they have no power of their own, God is willing to listen to them. The most important saint, by far, is the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, who is believed to have particularly strong influence. After her come the twelve Apostles, Christ's closest followers during His ministry on Earth, and particularly St Peter, the first Bishop of Rome and the rock on which the Church was built. St Paul, called the Apostle to the Gentiles, is of almost equal importance. There are many other saints, including the saints of the Old Testament, such as Abraham, Moses, and David, martyrs, who were killed for their faith, and witnesses, who bore witness to God's message in particularly impressive ways.

The Church is, in 1220, moving towards an official list of recognized saints, although the process is not yet complete. Further, the Church recognizes that there are many saints in heaven who are not on the Church's list. The list includes only those saints that the Church is sure about, which means that they lived a clearly holy life, and that miracles have been attributed to their intercession after death.

Saints often take an interest in a particular area of life or institution, reflecting their interests when they were alive, and petitions addressed to the saint tend to be more effective in that area. Similarly, saints are particularly attentive to their relics, physical objects that were closely associated with the saint in life, most often bodies or body parts. The faithful often make long pilgrimages to pray at a shrine containing the relics of a particularly important or appropriate saint.

This, however, moves into tricky territory. Strictly speaking, no-one worships saints, and the requests for intercession addressed to them are to be distinguished from the prayers offered directly to God. In practice, most people are rather fuzzy on the difference, and the Church doesn't mind, as long as the faithful accept that the Church's doctrine, which they don't fully understand, is correct. God does not require all His children to be expert theologians.

<span id="structures"></span>
=== Structures ===

The head of the Church on Earth is the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, who is the Vicar of Christ. (A vicar is someone who performs a role on behalf of someone else.) Over the last century popes have been campaigning to increase the actual authority of their office, and the campaign is working. Nevertheless, lower-ranked churchmen have a great deal of independence. In theory, anyone who disagrees with a lesser bishop's decision can appeal to the pope, but in practice this is so expensive and difficult that only the most serious problems, involving kings and major lords, or powerful monasteries, actually make it there.

There are many other bishops across Europe, all based in a city, or at least somewhere that was as close to a city as the area had when the bishopric was founded. The church where the bishop has his seat is known as the cathedral church, from the Latin term for the literal, physical chair, and the area around is called the diocese. The bishop's responsibilities start with ensuring that the clergy, monks, and nuns are all doing their jobs and living lives appropriate to their station, but also extend, in theory, to the

<span id="game-use-saints"></span>
=== Game Use: Saints ===

Saints are an excellent medium for divine intervention in a saga. First, most medieval stories of divine activity involve a saint as mediator, so this choice keeps medieval flavor. Further, there are many saints, some quite local and obscure, and they all have different personalities. Some are quite abrasive, particularly when dealing with people opposed to God's work. Thus, you can make up a local saint with a personality appropriate to the story you want to tell.

The attitude of saints to the covenant and the magi depends on whether you decide that magic is inherently sinful. It need not be; magic is opposed by both Divine and Infernal auras, after all. If magic is inherently sinful, any saint will want the magi to abandon it. If it is not, saints will merely urge the magi to use their power in the service of God. Either way, there are many specific options for using saints.

A saint takes an interest in the covenant, and starts looking after it. He or she appears in the dreams of covenfolk offering warnings, and occasionally manifests in the covenant to warn against sin or advise on God's will. On the one hand, this is a very useful ally. On the other, the magi will want to avoid a Dominion aura springing up within the covenant.

The covenant comes into conflict, over land or some other resource, with a monastery that has a particularly protective patron saint. They find that their magic is opposed by the power of the Divine, forcing them to find another resolution.

Members of the covenant become particularly devoted to a saint with a shrine some distance away, and pilgrimages become a feature of normal life. Even the magi might choose to venerate this saint.

The covenant discovers an important relic in the course of an adventure. Keeping it at the covenant would guarantee a stream of pilgrims and an eventual Dominion aura, but giving it away would make a firm ally of the recipient — and possibly enemies of the other groups who wanted it.

spiritual well-being of every human being in the area. In particular, bishops often find themselves protecting the Jews of a town from angry, and antisemitic, mobs.

A bishop carries out his duties primarily by means of visitations. In these, he visits a priest or monastery, and carries out investigations to ensure that all is in order. The enthusiasm that bishops bring to these duties varies widely, but very few will overlook persistent reports of major abuses.

Within the diocese, Europe is divided up into parishes. Each parish has a church, the parish church, and a priest, the parish priest, assigned to look after the spiritual well-being of all those within, a position called 'having cure of souls'. Everyone has their own parish, and is supposed to confess only to their parish priest, although exceptions are made for travelers and extreme circumstances. In some parishes, the priest with primary responsibility, called the rector, actually performs the duties. In others, he pays another priest, called the curate, to do the actual work for him.

<span id="canon-law"></span>
==== Canon Law ====

The Church has its own law, canon law, which is based on the old Roman law but covers all aspects of Church life. It also covers a number of areas that might not seem obviously related to the Church: marriage, inheritance, and commerce, most notably.

All canon law cases must, in theory, be heard by the bishop of the appropriate diocese. In 1220, formal structures to delegate this authority to full-time judges are being established, but the process is far from complete, and many cases are still judged by the bishop in person, or by a representative chosen for that particular case.

Heresy is a growing concern of the church courts. Most heretics are encouraged to accept the teachings of the Church by their parish priests, and the vast majority, being heretical through ignorance rather than conviction, do so. The few who reach court generally recant, returning to the Church, if they are convicted, and this always ends the case. Those who persist in their heresy may, finally, be handed over to the secular authorities for execution, but the Church is reluctant to do this as it all but ensures someone's damnation. However, if the alternative is a serious risk of damnation for more people, misled by the heretic, they feel they have no choice.

Canon law on commerce makes it illegal to lend money at interest, to buy things and sell them at a profit unless you have transported them a long distance, and to buy large stocks of something when it is cheap, to sell when it is expensive. Canon law only covers Christians, so these

The magi are accused of heresy, and forced to defend themselves in court.

The magi use magic to get around some of the canon law rules on commerce, making a large amount of money, but stirring up opposition from mundane merchants, who appeal to the bishop.

activities are all legal for Jews, which has made a few Jews extremely wealthy, while inflaming the prejudices of those who owe them money.

<span id="resources-1"></span>
==== Resources ====

The Church, as an institution, has extensive resources. The most basic of these is the tithe; the Church is entitled to one tenth of everything of which God gives the increase; essentially, all agricultural products. This is a substantial amount, and the Church and its agents are quite enthusiastic about gathering it. Failing to pay the tithe is a serious sin, for which heavy penances are routinely assigned.

In addition, the Church owns a good deal of property, from which it draws income just as any other mundane lord. The result of this is that many high-ranking clerics are personally very wealthy, a situation that some people, including some lower-ranking clerics, find incompatible with the Church's mission.

In theory, one third of the tithe is supposed to be used to support the poor. In practice, much less than this is devoted to charity, but the Church is still effectively the only source of support for the most vulnerable members of society.

<span id="game-use-resources"></span>
== Game Use: Resources ==

Magi still have to pay the tithe. God gives the increase on vis sources. Most priests won't care, but what if the local priest does?

A covenant might be located so that the nearest major lord is a bishop or monastery, rather than a mundane noble. Alternatively, the mundane noble the covenant had good relations with might die without an heir, leave his lands to the Church, and give the covenant a new, powerful neighbor to handle.

<span id="monasteries"></span>
=== Monasteries ===

Monasteries, and the female equivalent, convents, are a vital part of the Mythic European landscape. Ranging in size from tiny establishments with a handful of members to mighty castles with dozens of monks and influence covering thousands of miles, they shape the Church in many ways.

The members of monasteries are referred to as 'regular clergy', because they are bound by a rule (regulus), as opposed to the 'secular clergy', who live in the world (seculum). The details of the monastic rule vary from one tradition to another, but the basics are the same.

All monks and nuns take vows of poverty, chastity, stability, and obedience. The vow of poverty means that they have no personal possessions, that of chastity that they have no sexual relations, that of stability that they remain at one monastery, and that of obedience that they do whatever the head of their house commands.

The monastic day is structured around the seven monastic offices, church services that take place spread throughout the day. In some traditions, notably the Cluniac, these services have become so elaborate that there is little time to do anything else other than eat and sleep. In others, such as the Cistercian, they are still balanced with physical or mental labor of some sort.

<span id="game-use-monasteries"></span>
=== Game Use: Monasteries ===

While monks make poor player characters, since they are supposed to stay in their monasteries, friars are an excellent choice. They are supposed to wander around, and thus have a perfect excuse for ending up at the covenant.

Monasteries are a good place for traveling magi to stay. Their duty of hospitality means that they will usually not simply turn away even those with the Blatant Gift.

Monastic scholars make good correspondents for magi, and good potential allies.

Still, the main service that the monasteries provide is their prayers. Monks have given up the world to better serve God, and so their prayers are regarded as particularly effective. Many relics are held at monasteries, encouraging pilgrimages. As an extension of this, most monasteries are required to offer hospitality to travelers, at no charge, although visitors are expected to make a donation in line with their means.

Giving to monasteries is particularly well-regarded in Europe, and so many of them have become rich and powerful. Of particular note in this respect is the abbey of Cluny, in France, which heads the Cluniac Order, a group of monasteries spread over the whole of Europe. Thus, while the monks are, technically, poor, many have access to and control of vast resources.

These resources give the monks time to devote to scholarship and art, and thus monasteries are often centers of high culture. In recent years towns and cities have been starting to take over this role, but many monasteries still have proud traditions of study or craftsmanship.

In the early years of the thirteenth century a new type of regular clergy makes its appearance. These are the mendicant friars, 'begging brothers', who take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and travel the world preaching and serving God. As yet the two major orders, Franciscan and Dominican, are still new, but they are growing in popularity extremely rapidly.

<span id="miracles-1"></span>
=== Miracles ===

God intervenes in the world, and his interventions take the form of miracles. Miracles are not common events, but neither are they incredibly rare. Almost everyone in Mythic Europe knows someone who has witnessed or benefited from a miracle, and more people have witnessed miracles than have witnessed Hermetic magic.

By far the most common kind of miracle is a healing miracle, including the raising of the dead. The dead are normally raised within a week or so of dying, although God is capable of raising those who have been dead for longer if he so wishes. Injuries, diseases, and inherited afflictions are also cleansed by miracles.

The next most common miracle is a punishment miracle, inflicting some sort of infirmity on a person who has been particularly disrespectful to God or his agents. These punishments are a call to repentance, and thus while they are debilitating, they are very rarely fatal.

Finally, there is a vast range of miscellaneous miracles, ranging from freeing those unjustly

imprisoned to saving a talking bird from a hawk, via sending an angel to fight on a pious knight's behalf at a tournament.

Most healing miracles happen at a shrine holding relics, but it isn't a large majority. The guardians of such shrines, often monks, can expect to see dozens of miracles in a typical year, and a pilgrim to such a shrine has a very good chance of witnessing one.

God grants miracles as He wishes, and His purposes are sometimes inscrutable. However, a miracle is more likely to be granted if it is sincerely requested by a pious person, if the cause of the affliction was entirely innocent, and if an appropriate saint adds his prayers to those of the living Christian (or Jew, or Muslim). Still, God is perfectly free, and sometimes grants miracles to help people who seem less than pious.

<span id="game-use-miracles"></span>
=== Game Use: Miracles ===

Miracles are an excellent way to emphasize the Myth in Mythic Europe, and storyguides should not be afraid to use them that way. They are also, however, the ultimate plot device, as they can do anything, no matter what. Thus, storyguides should use them in moderation, to avoid leaving the players feeling that they have nothing to do.

Also, setting the frequency of miracles is an important part of deciding just how Mythic your Mythic Europe is. The frequency described in the main text is a default level, but you could choose to make miracles very rare, maybe one per year at major shrines, or very common, so that every parish sees a handful of miracles within the parish every year.

A grog killed in battle with a dragon is raised from the dead at the prayers of his wife and five small children. He comes back with a chilling tale of purgatory, and of having seen a recently-deceased magus burning in hell. He starts an immediate campaign to bring the covenant back to righteousness.

A magus confronting some bandits is suddenly deprived of his magical power. Nevertheless, his grogs easily defeat the attackers, and the magus is unharmed. His power returns afterwards, what lesson is God trying to teach him?

A character with a serious problem finds that the magi cannot help, as it is part of her Essential Nature. Instead, she seeks a miracle.

<span id="the-nobility"></span>
== The Nobility ==

The Church is a truly European organization, with a common structure and common beliefs. The nobility are a group of individual lords, with many common interests and links between them. Although there is a great deal of shared culture among the nobility, there is less than there is among the clergy, so this section is even more prone to over-generalization than the last. More details about the nobility in general can be found in ''Lords of Men'', while the Tribunal books provide information about the noble culture of particular regions.

<span id="peudalism"></span>
==== Peudalism ====

Most of Europe is ruled through the feudal system. This system is tied together by oaths of fealty, in which one person swears to provide a certain sort of service for another in return for being given control of an area of land. The sort of service required is overwhelmingly military; in its simplest form, the person swearing (the vassal) promises to serve his lord in battle for a certain number of days every year. If the area of land (called a fief) is large, the vassal may be required to provide the services of more than one warrior. In that case, it is very common to grant parts of your fief as fiefs to other warriors, on condition that they serve you, so that you can meet your obligations to your lord.

In outline, the system sounds like a simple pyramid, with the king at the top, and lords of progressively smaller fiefs below. However, things are far more complex than that. First, lords at most levels have direct vassals with fiefs of wildly differing sizes. A king might have one direct vassal who controls an area covering several towns and dozens of villages, while another controls half of a single village. Further, vassals can swear fealty to several different lords, as long as they can meet all the obligations. At the extreme, the king of England is answerable to no-one for England itself, but has sworn fealty to the king of France for his possessions in mainland Europe. It is not at all uncommon for a lord to be a direct vassal of a king for some land, but to be a vassal of a vassal for others. It is even possible for two people to be each other's vassals, for different fiefs, but that is rare to the point of being unheard-of.

Within his fief, a lord is responsible for some aspects of law and order. The extent of his responsibility varies depending on the lord and the customs of the country, but in general petty crime is under the jurisdiction of the local lord, and the death penalty can only be imposed by the king or some other extremely powerful nobles.

All the land in the fief is under the control of the lord. Some of it he farms himself (the demesne), the

== Game Use: Feudalism ==

Because magi are required by the Code to avoid swearing fealty to any mundane lord, feudalism is more likely to be a part of the background of the saga, rather than an immediate source of story seeds. Still, the complex webs of loyalty it creates are ideal breeding grounds for stories.

rest he rents out to peasants in return for a share of their crop and some of their labor on his own lands. The nobility are thus very close to the agricultural cycle, although the more land a noble has, the more he is insulated by layers of vassals and staff.

<span id="travel"></span>
=== Travel ===

Medieval nobles travel a lot, for a variety of reasons. First, wars seldom take place within a noble's fief, so in order to fulfill his obligation to fight, he must travel. Second, lords often summon their vassals to councils or consultations, so the vassal

his lord is. Sometimes, the summons comes from the king, gathering many nobles in one place for a grand council. Third, lords are Christians like anyone else, and they actually have the resources to go on pilgrimages. As a result, they often do.

Lords with scattered fiefs normally travel between those fiefs over the course of the year. This is because it is easier to transport the noble's household between two places than to transport enough food and drink to satisfy dozens of people for several weeks. As a result, a powerful noble is rarely in one place for very long, and when he does arrive it makes an enormous difference to local society.

Lords also visit their vassals. In part this is to reinforce the bonds of loyalty, and to make sure that the vassal is treating the land well. It also serves as a way to weaken vassals who are becoming threatening, because they are required to support their lord and his entourage, an expensive undertaking.

Finally, nobles simply enjoy visiting one another. Personal visits are the best way to stay in touch with friends and relatives, and the chance to visit new people helps to make life more interesting.

<span id="game-use-travel"></span>
== Game Use: Travel ==

Travel, obviously, allows the storyguide to bring nobles into the saga for a single session, or take them out for a period of time, if so desired.

The local lord, who is on excellent terms with the covenant, is expecting a visit from his lord. He asks the covenant for help in defraying the expenses, and in making sure that the visitor is impressed.

The local lord is powerful, and only visits that fief every couple of years. When he does come, however, the magi have to tread very carefully; he doesn't know the truth about the covenant, and they would prefer to keep it that way.

The local lord, who is somewhat hostile, is called away to a great council, which drags on. His wife, left behind, struggles with a problem facing the fief, and calls on the magi for help. If they succeed, she becomes more friendly, but her husband's attitude does not necessarily change.

<span id="entertainments"></span>
==== '''Entertainments''' ====

The nobility of Mythic Europe have a significant amount of leisure time, particularly when there isn't a war on. As a group of warriors, their favored pastimes tend to be somewhat warlike. The most extreme example of this is the tournament. This is basically an organized battle, where the participants try not to kill each other. The rules do allow the winners to claim the armor and weapons of the losers, so a skilled knight can make a good living on the tournament circuit. Many kings are suspicious of tournaments, and most churchmen believe them to be inherently sinful.

Tournaments, while popular, are difficult and expensive to organize, and occasionally banned by Church and lay authorities. Another extremely popular noble pastime, which does not suffer from these problems, is the hunt. Almost any animal can be hunted, although the deer is probably the most popular quarry, and while the standard hunt involved hunters on horseback, hunting with falcons is also popular, and considered suitable for women as the human hunters do not have to ride about vigorously. Some nobles even hunt magical creatures, although that is recognized to be extremely dangerous.

Large areas of some countries, notably England, are set aside as hunting ranges for the nobility. Noone else is allowed to hunt the animals therein, or to cultivate the land. Peasants in the surrounding areas are generally allowed some activities within these preserves, but they are very limited, to such things as foraging pigs and gathering acorns.

A group of nobles target an intelligent magical beast that is allied with the covenant. The beast asks for help.

A shapeshifter who can turn into a bear is getting into noble households as a 'trained bear'. The bear is extremely impressive, but the shapeshifter has deeper, more devious plans.

Nobles also enjoy stories of noble activities, and as more of the nobility become literate, manuscripts of romances and legends are increasing in popularity. Even those members of the nobility who cannot read can have the books read to them. Entertainers, including minstrels, acrobats, and trained animals, are also popular. Fights between various animals, such as between two cocks, or between a bear and several dogs, are also popular.

<span id="inheritance"></span>
==== Inheritance ====

Most noble power in Mythic Europe is inherited by the son from the father. This is, however, far from a universal rule, and squabbles over the succession are quite common, particularly when a major lordship (also called an honor) is at stake. In addition, younger sons present a significant problem. If the honor is split between all the sons, the family is weakened. On the other hand, giving the younger sons nothing stores up political trouble, even if the father doesn't care at all about their feelings. Thus, in one sense families would like exactly one son.

That, however, is very risky, because people die unexpectedly. Thus, noble families tend to try for a large number of children, in the hope of

She seeks help from the magi.

getting at least one male heir. Daughters can be married to other nobles, thus building alliances, but younger sons must be found a place in the world. The Church is one obvious destination for them, as is service to a more powerful lord. The most powerful lords, such as kings, often create honors for their younger sons from holdings that have reverted to the king after treason, or when a line fails to produce heirs.

Women only inherit if they have no brothers, and they are expected to marry someone who can be the 'real' lord of the area. Almost the only way for a woman to get real power is for her to be the widow of a lord who had no heirs, as in that case the lands normally stay with her until her death, before reverting to the overlord.

<span id="muthic-options"></span>
=== Muthic Options ===

This section covers options for increasing the amount of magic in the nobility. If you want to keep medieval society fairly mundane, you shouldn't use any of them. If, on the other hand, you want magic to be everywhere, you might use all of them.

Medieval legends often tell of faerie nobles, living in a very similar manner to human nobles but with strange features, such as being dressed entirely in green and surviving having their head cut off. In Mythic Europe, such nobles might swear fealty to the king and be part of the normal feudal structure.

While Hermetic magi are prohibited from serving mundane nobles, lesser magicians are not. A noble line where a useful supernatural ability is passed from generation to generation might hold land on condition that they serve the king with that ability, and if the person who inherits the ability is female, she inherits in her own right.

A line of intelligent, magical horses might be the real rulers of a fief. While there is a nominal human lord, who rides the current true ruler, the horses are the power behind the throne. (This could also apply to magical hunting dogs, or magical hawks. Magical pigs should only run a fief if you want a slightly silly location.)

A powerful faerie or magical creature might accept the fealty of human lords, and refuse to swear fealty to any mere human being. This option effectively creates a new kingdom in Europe, and a kingdom where the provisions of the Code are less than perfectly clear. If an area is ruled by a dragon, is it mundane?

A line of wise and successful lords might owe their success to an enchanted item of some sort. The item might be able to support complete incompetents or, more likely, give a competent lord a significant edge in war and politics, so that even a less talented heir can get by. The importance of the item may or may not be public knowledge. The item might be Hermetic, from another magical

source, or faerie in origin. Relics and infernal artifacts can play much the same role, but they have slightly different implications.

An evil lord might really have sold his soul to the devil, and thus have lots of infernal powers to help him oppress the peasants.

<span id="towns-and-trade"></span>
== Towns and Trade ==

If the generalizations about the nobility had exceptions, generalizations about towns are almost nothing but exceptions. A town is a settlement where a significant proportion of the population (a third and up, say) does not make its living directly from agriculture. On this definition, towns range from villages with a few hundred inhabitants to the great metropolis of Constantinople, with tens of thousands at the very least (well, before it was sacked, at least). Obviously, a town of a few hundred people in Ireland bears little resemblance to Constantinople. More detail about towns and trade is provided in ''City &amp; Guild''.

Nevertheless, these points can be used to create towns that feel medieval, even if they don't fit exactly into any actual part of medieval Europe.

<span id="markets-and-pairs"></span>
=== Markets and Pairs ===

Markets are the stage before a town, and often the nucleus around which new towns grow. A market is a formally established place and time for trading locally produced goods. Most gather once per week, although there are exceptions, and draw people from an area about twelve miles across. This

== Game Use: Markets and Pairs ==

Sending the grogs to market makes an excellent story that need not involve any magi.

Markets can provide substantial income, so a covenant might want to establish one under its control. A market controlled by the magi is also a good way to slowly put magically created goods into circulation, without raising too many suspicions. However, markets bring visitors, who might be over curious, and attract hostility from other local markets, that don't like the competition.

An ambitious covenant might even try to sponsor a fair, but that just makes the potential problems even larger.

Magi needing exotic pieces of laboratory equipment, or materials from distant lands, travel to a fair to find them.

allows people to walk to market, do their business, and walk home, all in a single day.

There may be rules about who is allowed to buy and sell what at the market. For example, peasants may be required to sell their grain to merchants resident in the town, and only those merchants are allowed to sell grain to anyone else. There are often fees for setting up stalls at the market, and the lord controlling the market can collect fines at a market court.

The bulk of trade at all markets is agricultural produce, but other goods, including those brought some distance, are also available. Truly exotic goods, however, cannot be found here, the selection is limited to simple tools, clothes, home utensils, and the like. The main customers are peasants, so the offerings are tailored to them.

Because large numbers of people gather at them, markets are also centers for news, entertainment, and people seeking employment, or just wanting to meet new people. Most peasants travel to market many times per year, so they are not as cut off from news of the wider world as modern players might think. It takes time for news to travel, but if it is interesting, travel it does.

Fairs are, essentially, temporary towns. They normally happen once per year, and last for several days. The smallest draw from a large region (that's what makes them more than markets), and the largest, in the Champagne region of France, draw from the whole of Europe. In most ways, a fair is a really big market, but almost anything can be bought there. The customers include the nobility and high churchmen, so luxury goods are sold.

By the early thirteenth century the greatest days of the fairs are over, as towns begin to take over their role, but they still have a great deal of life left in them.

<span id="towns"></span>
=== Towns ===

Most medieval towns cover a fairly small area of land, and many are walled. Within the walls buildings can have as many as four stories, and streets are very narrow. Rubbish is thrown into the streets, including the rubbish from slaughterhouses, and feral animals feed off it. Sewage may also be thrown into the streets, or into the river.

As a result the air in towns is very bad, and often unbalances the humors of those living there. People die significantly younger in towns than they do in the countryside, and most towns only maintain their population through immigration from the land around.

Despite the dangers and unpleasantness of living in a town, people immigrate because there are jobs there. If a peasant family grows too large for its land to support, daughters are often sent to work as

<span id="game-use-towns"></span>
=== Game Use: Towns ===

Clever use of magic can offset the penalties of the bad air of towns, and small magical auras, or even regiones, might persist, allowing a covenant to be sited there.

Most of the story ideas for markets and fairs also apply to towns.

In some countries, towns have a great deal of discretion to run their own affairs, as long as they pay a certain amount of tax. Thus, a covenant might try to be legally recognized as a town. Many covenants are certainly large enough.

domestic servants. Similarly, peasants with no land might head to the towns to work as laborers, or even find a trade.

People visit the town even more often, because the larger towns are becoming, in effect, permanent fairs where the wealthy can buy almost anything they want. In most areas of Mythic Europe there are few adult peasants who haven't visited a town at least once.

In most areas, towns stand a little outside the feudal system. They are often run by councils of the leading merchants, or other wealthy citizens, rather than by a warrior noble, and sometimes they may be entirely independent, and lords of a significant area of the countryside. In these cases, people may flee to the town to escape harsh lords, or to flee justice. Towns are the only places with a crowd large enough to lose yourself in.

<span id="mythic-options"></span>
== Mythic Options ==

A faerie town is just as possible as a faerie lord, and would probably be a very popular place for magi to go shopping. It might also be fully integrated into the local economy, and even have some human immigrants.

People with supernatural abilities could set up as traders in a town, as well as in service to a lord. This option needs handling with considerable care, however, as towns with Magic Shops feel very much like generic fantasy.

A town might be alive as a whole, and aligned to any realm. People living there might be real, or merely part of the town. Such a town might even be able to move.

<span id="peasants-1"></span>
== Peasants ==

Peasants make up 90% of medieval society. While they don't really eat mud, they don't, for the most part, eat very well, and famine is a recurrent feature of society.

Peasants make their living from the land or the sea, whether from arable crops, livestock, or fishing. Their legal rights vary a great deal from region to region, from theoretically the same as a nobleman, to almost no rights at all. In all areas, they are almost powerless, and thus often cannot claim those rights they have.

Most peasant families are very nearly selfsufficient, growing their own food, maintaining

their own homes, and mending their own clothes and furniture. However, they are as prone to curiosity as any other human being, and all have been to market, the overwhelming majority to town, and most on a pilgrimage to a local shrine at least. While they are all illiterate and without formal education, they are neither stupid nor completely uninformed, on the whole.

In Mythic Europe, the supernatural is a part of the lives of most peasants. Minor magical creatures and faeries visit villages, or live in the crop fields, or watch over the pigs foraging in the local woods. A magical pool might make a virgin beautiful and irresistible if he or she bathes in it (local stories say it might work twice, but no-one has ever been able to try), a tree might grow enchanted apples that taste, and intoxicate, like the finest cider, or the leader of the local wolves might negotiate an agreement with the villagers every year, specifying how many sheep the pack will take. Very few villages are without any touch of the supernatural in the surrounding area, but most such touches have little effect on daily life.

<span id="public-power-for-comen"></span>
= Public Power for Comen =

elatively few women hold public power in Mythic Europe. The elaboration of their roles below should not discourage players from selecting exceptional

women as their characters. The constraints, and ways to avoid them, listed here are suggested as material for storytelling, not as proscriptions. Troupes should consider carefully how the fun of a historically accurate setting intersects with the fun of playing a character who uses her wits to challenge social conventions. The Paid Rights Virtue (page 100) is a gamemechanical way to acknowledge that an exceptional woman is just that: exceptional.

Players, who are likely most familiar with the English system, should be aware that women have fewer rights in England than in most other parts of Mythic Europe. This is, in part, an effect of the Conquest. The military character of the Norman nobility has not entirely given way to hereditary aristocracy. In areas where landholding is seen as a method of supporting warriors, women have fewer rights, while in those areas where landholding is seen as method of generating money to sustain an army, women have greater rights.

<span id="dressing-as-a-man"></span>
== Dressing As A Man ==

This is the simplest way to ignore social conventions concerning women. There are many folkloric examples of women dressing as men and doing almost anything men do. War or pilgrimage, for example, are easier when pretending to be male. This may become a Dark Secret (page 124), and may also qualify the character for Gender Nonconforming (page 131).

Dressing as a man is not usually a successful strategy for the extended term: marriage and fathering children are difficult, if surmountable, obstacles. A woman who dresses as a man and engages in warfare is, however, likely to die young, as most men do, so this may not be a concern.

<span id="rolding-land"></span>
== '''Rolding Land''' ==

Women can gain control of land in six ways: during absence, through inheritance, via political success, through conquest, in a widow's portion, or as a steward.

<span id="absence"></span>
==== Absence ====

Landholding is intimately tied, in most of Mythic Europe, to providing military service. The male head of most families must be available to fight in campaigns, some of which last for months, or in civil wars, which can sputter along for years. Many nobles leave their wives as their deputies. The value of an educated wife to the military preparedness of her husband has overcome many of the objections concerning the education of women.

Women raised for this task always have Leadership and Profession: Steward scores. They also rapidly develop Ability scores that their husbands have due to the peculiarities of their holdings, allowing them to oversee work, or at least select competent overseers. In this role of deputy the woman has the right to spend the income of the husband's territory, and may command his vassals in many matters, including war.

The role that women play in the command of troops varies between the societies of Europe. It is further influenced by the personalities, Reputations and resources of the lady and her vassals. Women rarely lead troops into battle, but there are many references to noble women holding castles against sieges. During a siege the lady may command troops directly, or may direct their command through a skilled lieutenant.

Many noblewomen maintain networks of agents completely separate from the households of their husbands. A wife may take over her husband's network if he dies or is on campaign. This role, as correspondent and diplomat, is expected of the wives of nobility. A woman who does not socialize is considered a poor supporter of her husband's efforts.

<span id="inheritance-1"></span>
==== '''Inheritance''' ====

Lands inherited by women are a recognized feature of feudal life in most kingdoms. In most areas land goes to sons before daughters, but daughters are given preference over more distant male relations, like uncles and cousins. Some areas grant all of the land to the eldest son, and the daughter receives it intact if there are no sons. In others, when a paternal line extinguishes in this way, the land is divided between all of the remaining sisters, or their husbands. In a few areas, women are permitted to inherit directly, either because the land of a family is divided between all of the siblings not already members of the church, or because the lord is permitted to nominate his heirs and so may choose his daughters.

A woman who rules a fief by inheritance usually retains legal authority in it during her marriage. With the exception of England, where the wife's rights become the husband's, there are many examples of women who married another noble, yet continued to hold court, issue charters, and command vassals. In Castile there is at least one example of an odd midpoint, where the bride continued to rule in her own land, with the exception of her dowry, which was transferred to her husband. At the death of the heiress, her lands may be kept by her eldest son, if the area practices primogeniture. In areas where the lands of the parents are divided, the separate character of the wife's lands make them an obvious domain for one of her sons

Land that a father has added to his ancestral territories may be made available as dowry. Dowries are used, in much of Europe, as a sort of inheritance before the death of the father.

<span id="political-success"></span>
== Political Success ==

It is rare for anyone, male or female, to be granted land for purely political favors, but it occasionally occurs as a result of stories. A common way for a woman to be granted land is to become the mistress of a powerful nobleman and bear his child. If the woman has suitable abilities, she may be made the child's guardian until he is of age to join his father's household.

<span id="conquest"></span>
=== Conquest ===

Some women claim land through invasion, allowing their retinue of knights to settle conquered areas as vassals. This requires loyal retainers and either a friendly monarch or a formidable reputation, as a mercenary captain or disloyal male vassal might try to swear fealty for the land himself. Such women rarely enter combat themselves, but since they are the leaders of their armies, it would be insubordinate to gainsay them if they wished it.

<span id="widows-portion-and-stewardship"></span>
=== Widow's Portion and Stewardship ===

In most areas a widow is permitted to retain the use of a portion of her husband's lands for her own use after his death. As a rule of thumb, assume a widow can keep the profit, not income, of a third of her husband's land until she remarries. If the woman was already landed at marriage, and has no adult sons, then she is likely to have complete ownership of her lands returned to her. Widows are extremely common in Mythic Europe.

In some areas, like France, Castile and parts of the Holy Roman Empire, a widow may act as her son's guardian. This allows her to administer land on his behalf until he is an adult. Stewardship of lands may need to be purchased from the dead husband's overlord. In many areas the lord has the right to select the stewards for the heirs of vassals, and he may even arrange the marriage of the widow. By convention, no woman may be given by her lord in marriage a third time.

<span id="duns"></span>
== Duns ==

A third avenue for power, and one much enjoyed by the younger daughters of some lords, is the church. The role of nunneries is discussed in greater detail in the supplements ''Realms of Power: The Divine Revised Edition'' and ''The Church''. Nuns are considered wards of the bishop, and brides of Christ. They cannot usually be forced to marry and are not answerable to their fathers or other local lords. Nuns hold a great deal of land in Mythic Europe, and their estates are not divided by inheritance.

Young women may take temporary vows which allow them to retreat into the life of a nun while events unfold in the secular world. It is possible for a sufficiently influential nobleman to force a woman to leave the nunnery and marry, but this is rare. It is common for the female relatives of a man who has lost a war to retreat into the nunneries, so that they are not at the mercy of the victors.

<span id="comen-as-carriors"></span>
== Comen As Carriors ==

In most areas there are folktales about particular women who, at some past time, acted in the role of knight. How characters react to contemporary women who attempt the same course varies by culture and by the status of the particular woman. In the Order of Hermes, the philosophy of Plato, coupled with the scarcity of The Gift, has led to a position of equity. Plato advocated the training of women for all the duties of the state including administration and warfare. Very few women seek military success, but enough do for the role to be accepted, to some degree, in most areas. The following examples may guide the generation of background for female nobles who seek military roles.

<span id="dressing-as-a-man-margaret-of-beverley"></span>
== Dressing As A Man: Margaret of Beverley ==

Margaret of Beverley was born in the Holy Land: her parents were English pilgrims who commenced their journey while her mother was pregnant. After reaching adulthood and seeing to the education of her younger brother, Margaret decided to revisit Jerusalem. Through terrible luck, she was present when Jerusalem fell to Saladin in 1187.

She pretended to be a man, and took part in the defense of the wall, wearing improvised armor. Margaret was struck by a fragment thrown up by a stone fired from a siege engine, and carried scars for the rest of her life. She was captured, ransomed, and then after a difficult period involving slavery, theft, and rescue by the grace of the Virgin she was able to arrive in Antioch, in time to participate in the siege there.

After peace was concluded she sailed for England with the English army, departing from Acre. Her other travels, to Rome and Santiago, were almost as adventurous as this first trip. Historically, after her journeys she sought out her younger brother, who had become a monk, and he led her to the contemplative life. She joined a nunnery at Laon, in France, and may live there still in 1220.

<span id="inheritance-cleanor-of-aquitaine"></span>
== Inheritance: Cleanor of Aquitaine ==

Eleanor attended the Second Crusade with her husband, and was attended by a guard of female knights dressed as Amazons and mounted on white

horses. Eleanor's right to lead her troops, as overlord of Aquitaine, was incontestable. The queens of several of the other leaders followed her example. Her behavior was considered scandalous, and led to a Papal Bull forbidding women from taking the cross in the Third Crusade.

<span id="conquest-sikelgaita-of-sicily"></span>
== Conquest: Sikelgaita of Sicily ==

A princess of the Lombards, then the wife of the Duke of Apulia and Sicily, Sikelgaita is recorded as having participated in her husband's battles, dressed as a knight, and as charging enemies with a spear. In her husband's wars against the Byzantine Empire, she is recorded as rallying some troops that had fled a battle, sending them back into the fray at the Battle of Dyrrachium. The Norman conquests in Byzantium were lost after the war turned against her family.

<span id="absence-petronilla-of-leicester"></span>
=== Absence: Petronilla of Leicester ===

Petronilla is recorded as having armed herself as a knight and fought in battles during the reign of Henry II, perhaps due to the absence of her husband. A namesake was active during the wars of John against his barons, and purchased the right to select her own husband. This Petronilla used John's desperation for money to haggle the relatively good price of 4000 marks. The latter Petronilla has only been dead eight years.

<span id="political-success-matilda-of-tuscany"></span>
== Political Success: Matilda of Tuscany: ==

Matilda's parents were allies of the Pope, and open rebels against his rival the Emperor. Matilda was trained in warfare from an early age. Her tutor was later the commander of her forces and stated he had trained her in lance, pike, axe and sword. Matilda is widely believed to have ridden into battle from her teenage years.

She was the primary proponent of the Pope's cause during the Investiture Controversy, and through a series of marriages, alliances and wars, she all but destroyed Imperial authority in Northern Italy. Matilda led her armies through a series of wars, crushing Imperial forces so that only a few cities remained under the Emperor's banner. She spent her old age dispatching armies to besiege and capture many of these.

<span id="arrors-and-anachronisms"></span>
= '''Arrors and Anachronisms''' =

istorical errors are inevitable in any historical game. After all, even professional historians make historical errors in their books, which other professional

historians then correct. In the game, an anachronism is only a problem if it spoils the illusion that the game takes place in a particular historical period. Thus, introducing guns and wristwatches is bound to be a problem, while getting the cut of men's tunics wrong is only a problem if one of your players is a specialist in medieval costume.

If some of your players do know a lot more about particular aspects of the medieval period than you, you can use them as a resource. Have them explain the details of costume, scholarship, or food, as it becomes relevant to the game. A player who uses his knowledge to break the mood for everyone else is a problem, and you should talk to him about it. If you know more than your players, then they are not likely to be bothered by anything that doesn't bother you.

As you play the game, you might well want to read more about medieval history. This is good, but it can mean that you discover that some aspect of your saga contradicts historical fact. What do you do then? If it isn't a problem for you or your players, you can leave it the way it is. If, on the other hand, the discrepancy does bother you, there are two options. Minor details can simply be changed to be historically accurate. If the King of France has always been Louis in your saga, but you discover that the historical king was Philip, you can simply announce that the king of France is actually called Philip, and always has been.

For things which have played an important role in the saga, that is unlikely to be an option. If the magi have been interacting extensively with the Parliament of England, you can't make it go away when you discover that, historically, it was first called ten years into your saga's future. The best option here, if something bothers you and is too important to change, is to explicitly move your saga to an alternate history. Work out some story as to why Parliament started thirty years earlier, or whatever. Since the player characters have been interacting with the feature extensively it is extremely unlikely that its current state would be historical anyway. It is worth remembering that, historically, there were no magi and no Order of Hermes, so the game is set in an alternate history in the first place.

Remember that the player characters are the central characters in the story. They may not be the most powerful characters, but they are central to the action. For example, in a horror story the characters must be weaker than the threat, because otherwise it will not inspire horror. However, the story is still about the way the characters deal with the threat, not about the activities of the monster.

You should always plan for the conflicts in the story to be resolved by the player characters, and for the outcome to be determined by their actions. In a horror story, the survival of the

player characters should depend on what they do, not on the actions of NPCs. In a political story, the decisions of the player characters should make a definite difference to the outcome. As noted on page 528, troupe style play can help here, because even if player characters need rescuing, other player characters can often perform the rescue.

Roleplaying game stories should not have a plot in advance. A plot is a sequence of events, with the causal relationships between them drawn out, and if you have that in advance there is only one thing for the player characters to do. This is a remarkably hard lesson to learn, because all the relevant forms of literature with which we are familiar do have plots, as do a lot of published adventures.

Instead, a story needs a set of situations, decisions on what will happen if the player characters do nothing, and decisions on what will happen in response to some of the more obvious possible player actions. Even then, you need to be ready for the player characters to do something unexpected. The better you know the situation, the easier this will be, although some storyguides are naturally very good at winging it.

If possible, you should set up several ways for the player characters to succeed in the adventure, so that the players do have real choices, which don't come down to 'do it the right way or die' This is related to the next point, the importance of variable outcomes.

<span id="variable-outcomes"></span>
== Variable Outcomes ==

You should have at least three possible outcomes for any story: one corresponding to success, another to a neutral performance, and one to failure. Ideally, there should be several degrees of success and failure. This allows you to set up one path as the route to the best success, without dooming the characters if they try something different.

In general, you should also avoid disastrous results for failures, at least unless the players are really, really stupid. If a failure would seriously damage the saga, you should make sure that it is very easy to avoid failing completely. Similar considerations may apply to the survival of magi and companions, although that depends on the attitude that your players have to their characters. (Grogs, on the other hand, are pretty much expected to die.) A disastrous outcome should be foreshadowed with increasing clarity as it gets closer, and ways to mitigate it should become ever more obvious. It is, of course, perfectly acceptable to make a positive outcome impossible if the characters follow a certain route, but disaster should be easy to avoid.

This means thinking of bad results that do not involve the death of beloved characters or the destruction of the covenant. Good options are to take possessions away from the characters, or to injure them so that they lose a lot of study time. You can also inflict longer-term penalties, but such penalties can spoil a player's enjoyment of a character, so they should be used with caution; the point of a game is to have fun, not to undergo some sort of moral discipline.

<span id="hooks-1"></span>
== hooks ==

Possibly the hardest part of an adventure is the beginning. It can be extremely hard for the players to see what they are supposed to do. This means that you need to have at least two possible courses of action in mind when you set up a story. It is a good idea to also think of ways in which you can supply hints if the players are completely floundering. If you have variable degrees of success available, you can give hints to a lesser degree of success, so that the players do benefit from working things out for themselves.

If possible, parts of the adventure should naturally flow into one another. The characters should not simply work out that they need to go to some place; they should work out that they need to go to that place and do something, and then when they do something it becomes clear what their following options are. If you don't do that, the

adventure\neffectively begins again\nevery time the characters complete the actions that have been made clear so far, and stand around wondering what to do next.

A related consideration concerns clues and information. If some information is important to the story, you should have one specific way that the characters can learn it in mind when writing the story. They may learn it another way, but if there is one way that you know will work, then the characters have a reasonable chance of learning the information. In addition, this method should be something that makes sense in the context of the story and saga. Asking the inhabitants of a village about a monster makes sense; going and looking behind the altar in the church does not, unless the monster has been seen coming from there.

It is surprisingly difficult to judge this, as the elements of stories always look obvious to the storyguide. One rule of thumb is that things need to be more obvious than you think. Beyond that, you can learn from experience what sorts of things occur to your players, and what situations leave them stymied.

<span id="climaxes"></span>
== Climaxes ==

It is good for a story to reach a climax and finish there, rather than petering out. This is, however, very difficult to reconcile with the importance of not having a plot. The best way round it is to work out two or three possible ways to resolve the situation set up in the story, and to make sure that each is a climactic event in which the player characters play a central role.

Sometimes this is simply impossible, as only one climax can resolve everything, and most alternatives leave some tidying up. In such a case, the tidying up should be made as trivial as possible, so that it doesn't need to be played out in detail. For example, if a diabolist has kidnapped the daughter of a local lord, a true climax would be defeating the diabolist in his lair and freeing the girl. If the girl is freed first, then the diabolist should come after the characters, so that the adventure doesn't end with them simply sneaking out of the lair and making their way home. On the other hand, if the diabolist is killed first, you should make it easy to get into the lair and rescue the girl, so that it can be glossed over in a few sentences.

This is probably the most flexible rule. If the players want to play through the aftermath in detail, because they enjoy that sort of roleplaying, you should certainly allow them to do so.

<span id="story-types"></span>
== Story Types ==

he power level of a saga makes a large difference to the sorts of stories you can easily run.

Hermetic magi are extremely flexible, especially once they

have a bit of experience. In most cases (see Saga Speed, on page 527) the power level of a saga will increase over time, and it is best if the style of play changes with it.

For simplicity, this discussion divides stories into three types: reactive, where something happens and the player characters respond; proactive, where the player characters want to do something and go out to make it happen; and soap opera, where the stories arise naturally from the continuing lives of the characters. Obviously, most stories will have elements of all of these types, but the basic distinction is helpful.

<span id="reactive-stories"></span>
== Reactive Stories ==

Reactive stories are a good way to start a saga, because it gives the players something immediate to do. They also serve to remind the players that their characters are not aware of everything going on in the world before it happens. They work well with young magi, but become harder to create as the magi get older.

This is because, with a reactive story, the magi are only interested in resolving the problem, and thus will use the most efficient means available. In general, they do not care how the problem gets resolved. Thus, elder magi might solve a political campaign against the covenant through the liberal use of Mentem spells. This is unlikely to provide the hours of entertaining political play that the storyguide was after. Investigative stories are quickly short-circuited by Intellego magic, and enemies that a powerful magus cannot simply dispatch are too powerful to be common.

Once the magi are very powerful, it is possible to run reactive stories for just the companions and grogs. Give them a reason not to disturb the magi, and then let them sort the problem out by themselves. It is possible to make the stories very challenging for the mundane characters, because if everything goes horribly wrong the players' other characters can charge in to save the day, which is much more satisfying for the players than having non-player characters do it.

There are several books full of reactive stories in the Ars Magica line. Tales of Mythic Europe contains stories suitable for relatively young magi, while Tales of Power contains stories for older

characters. ''Hooks'' contains a number of short stories designed to introduce new elements, such as noble politics or ancient magic, to the saga, and prime the characters to start on proactive stories. ''Thrice-Told Tales'' contains stories designed in three parts, which happen several years apart as part of the saga. Finally, ''Dies Irae'' contains several stories concerning ways in which the world might end, if the characters cannot prevent it.

<span id="proactive-stories"></span>
== Proactive Stories ==

Proactive stories are good at any power level. For one thing, you know that at least one player is interested in pursuing the story. For another, if the player wants stories to resolve something, that means that his character cannot trivially achieve it. As a magus increases in power, the character's ideas get steadily more grandiose, but always remain challenging. These challenges might arise because the character does not want to resolve the story in the easiest way possible.

As an example, a powerful maga might want to win the friendship of a local monastery, and have it be genuine friendship rather than magically enforced. All at once, the maga's magical power becomes much less important. She can use it to perform spectacularly helpful acts, but she cannot simply use Creo Mentem to make all the monks love her. Alternatively, a magus might want to make the covenant's magical aura into a mobile regio, so that they can travel secretly around Europe. Hermetic magic cannot just do this, no matter how high the magus's Arts are, so he must spend time looking for hidden mysteries and unearthing forgotten secrets. Things that go wrong in his experiments might well require a great deal of power to put right.

In one sense, hooking into these stories is very easy, the players want to do it. In another, it's very difficult, as getting suggestions out of your players can be like getting blood out of a stone. The best thing to do is just keep asking what the players want their characters to do, until they provide answers on which you can hang a story.

Several supplements for '''Ars Magica''' provide ideas for proactive stories. ''Ancient Magic, Legends of Hermes,'' and ''Mythic Locations'' describe things that characters might search for, while ''Hermetic Projects'' and ''Transforming Mythic Europe'' describe things that the characters might try to create.

<span id="soap-opera"></span>
== Soap Opera ==

Almost any long-running saga develops elements of soap opera, as the characters develop histories with each other. These sorts of story work well at all levels of power, because powerful magi have good reasons not to intervene with brute power when their friends are involved, and even if they do, then

<span id="places-to-explore"></span>
== Places to Explore ==

* The Covenant. If the covenant was there before the player characters joined, they may not know everything about it.
* Mundane Villages. The villages nearest the covenant will become aware of its existence, so it is a good idea if the magi know a bit about them. Friendly relations would be ideal, of course.
* Mundane Towns. The magi are likely to need supplies which have to be bought in a town, so they should explore the local towns. This might be best done by sending the grogs, with maybe a companion.
* Other Covenants. Magi are expected to give hospitality to visiting magi, even if they turn up uninvited. Getting to know your neighbors is a good idea, provided you can avoid upsetting them.
* A faerie forest where the intelligent creatures have the shape of animals, and the dumb brutes have the shape of humans.
* A faerie palace where a shining queen grants rewards to those who bring the most beautiful stories. The stories become jewels or fine tapestries when told, and it is possible to learn much from the queen's stored treasures.
* A faerie village which looks a lot like a mundane village, except that the wheat is literally golden and the fruit trees bear gems. Attempting to eat the food is not recommended.
* A set of ancient standing stones which form a magical regio. In higher levels the stones are aware and intelligent, being the forms of ancient spirits.
* An abandoned village, depopulated by an infernal plague and now the home of demons and undead.
* A lake which covers both a magical regio and a faerie regio. If characters enter the magical regio, they find many talking fish, which live in an elaborate society. In the faerie regio they find beautiful people living underwater, in a castle built of shells.
* A covenant that fell under mysterious circumstances, and has lain undisturbed since. (See ''Calebais: The Broken Covenant.'')

the consequences of their actions simply give rise to more soap operatic complications.

'Soap opera' does not mean that the stories are all about the adulteries of covenfolk, although some may be. It can include the ongoing relationship with a whimsical faerie queen, delicate negotiations with a dragon, and repeated battles with a demon who has injured the covenant in the past. Essentially, a soap opera story is one where the characters are constrained by the results of the past and their plans for the future.

Antagonists details a number of characters who would have ambiguous and difficult relations with player characters, and who could play an important part in soap-opera stories.

<span id="story-ideas"></span>
== Story Ideas ==

he first question faced by a new Ars Magica storyguide is 'What do magi do?'. What sort of adventures can you send them on? On the whole, they do not

go into cave complexes full of monsters, kill lots of them, and then carry away piles of treasure. On the other hand, they might do that occasionally. This section provides some guidance on stories.

<span id="exploration"></span>
== '''Exploration''' ==

The characters go somewhere they haven't been before, and find out about it. This covers going into caves, killing monsters, and taking their stuff, but it is much broader. It also includes traveling to the local abbey and trying to set up good relations with the abbot, finding a faerie forest and learning how to collect raw vis there, and even visiting other covenants of the Order for the first time.

Exploration stories are a very good way to start a saga, as the characters and players will both want to know more about the area around their covenant. In addition, once they have been introduced to an area you can use that place to generate more stories.

''Mythic Locations'' is a whole book full of places for characters to explore.

<span id="things-to-be-asked"></span>
== Things to be Asked ==

* A village is being stalked by a monster which carries off and eats virgins.
* The same village, nine months later, has a lot of strange babies who don't appear entirely human.
* A village is threatened by famine after the river dried up.
* The relics have been stolen from an abbey, and the monks fear that magic or devilworshippers were involved.
* Magi at the covenant made a bargain, almost a century ago, with a powerful monster, so that it would not destroy a city. The period of the bargain is almost up, and the city elders want the current magi to extend it. They have no idea what the details were.
* A nobleman is involved in a dispute with his neighbor, which is heading towards war. He portrays himself as the innocent victim of an unscrupulous robber, and begs the assistance of the magi.
* The other nobleman turns up a week later with a similar story of wronged innocence.

<span id="treasure-hunting"></span>
== Treasure Hunting ==

Magi are not immune to the lure of treasure hunting, particularly the lure of raw vis. For a covenant, the greatest treasure is a vis source, which reliably provides a certain number of pawns of vis every year. Mundane treasure also has some appeal, but most covenants are rich anyway, and magi with vis can make mundane riches fairly easily. Books are an exception, as useful ones cannot be magically created. Enchanted devices tempt magi almost as much as vis, and in some cases the search for an Arcane Connection to a powerful enemy can motivate an adventure.

You should be careful about handing out vis sources in the early sessions of the saga, as a generous supply of vis can lead to fast advancement on the part of the magi. If an isolated vis treasure is too large, you can just refrain from giving any more for a while, but taking a vis source away is more likely to annoy the players.

Ancient Magic is, in an important way, a whole book of treasures for characters to hunt, although the reward is more likely to be knowledge than a physical item. Legends of Hermes describes important

magi from the history of the Order, but involves the player characters by having them hunt the treasures that those magi left behind them.

<span id="requests-for-assistance"></span>
== Requests for Assistance ==

In many fantasy stories and legends, heroes or oppressed villagers travel to the wizard's tower, looking for assistance. In Ars Magica, the player characters are the ones who get asked for help. You could run an interesting story in which the players take the roles of people seeking help from the covenant, and those characters could join the covenant as grogs after their success, but more normally these stories would involve the magi responding to requests.

One problem with this sort of story is that the magi might not want to help, so it is generally better if the saga creates some reason for them to listen to the request. For example, most magi will listen to a request for help from a noble whom they have been desperately trying to turn into an ally, but are likely to ignore a request from a bunch of smelly peasants they've never heard of. On the

<span id="potential-crises"></span>
=== Potential Crises ===

* A monster attacks the covenant.
* A magus from another covenant starts a campaign of harassment against the covenant, being careful to avoid blatantly violating the Code. He might attack grogs, or blight crops, but he will not scry on the covenant, nor attack a magus without declaring Wizard's War.
* A bishop hears that the covenant is full of heretics, and sets out, with a small army, to investigate.
* A local lord demands that the covenant swear fealty to him, or face the consequences. Swearing is against the Code, but so is getting into a war with the nobility.
* A powerful faerie decides to use the covenant as part of his latest game.
* The covenant's Magical aura starts to fade.
* The covenant's Magical aura suddenly strengthens, and the magi find themselves sharing space with a group of annoyed, arrogant, and powerful spirits.
* The covenant disappears into a regio, and the magi cannot immediately find the way out. (Or in, for those who were away at the time.)
* The grogs rebel against the tyrannical rule of the magi. The players are likely to be playing both sides of this dispute, which could be tricky, but very effective for experienced players.

other hand, the story might be more concerned with how the covenant responds to the request, rather than with what happens when they have made their decision.

<span id="crises-at-home"></span>
== Crises at home ==

Some emergency faces the covenant. The advantage of this sort of story is that the characters will try to solve it. The problem is that the consequences of failure can be serious, so you have to give some thought to what will happen if the characters don't succeed.

In general, the reward for success in such adventures is simply that things do not get any worse. Thus, you should avoid relying on them too heavily, give the players a chance to get positive rewards for their heroism.

<span id="political-issues"></span>
=== Political Issues ===

* A Hermetic Tribunal is coming up, and the other covenants are looking for allies. Of course, choosing to work with one makes enemies of another.
* One of the player magi is framed for a serious Hermetic crime.
* One of the player magi is caught in a serious Hermetic crime.
* The covenant tries to build good relations with a local mundane notable, such as a lord, bishop, or abbot.
* A mundane enemy of the covenant tries to take an important piece of land, possibly containing a vis source, off them through legal processes.
* War threatens to break out in the region around the covenant. While the magi could stay neutral and, most likely, survive, it would not be good for the covenant. Can they broker a peace?
* The local bishop begins preaching vigorously against heresy, and priests are instructed to enquire much more closely into people's activities. Many people resent this, but no-one dares to speak out publicly for fear of being branded a heretic.
* The player character magi disagree strongly over the best course of action to take, and spend the entire session arguing about it.

<span id="politics"></span>
== Politics ==

The Order of Hermes has extensive politics, and the mundane elites of particular areas also have political concerns. Negotiation, trade, and court cases all fall under this general heading. Political adventures tend to involve little combat, and normally cannot be solved by the simple application of magic, which makes them good for more powerful magi. It also makes them a good place for companions to shine, particularly mundane politics, where The Gift is a serious hindrance to the magi.

<span id="quests"></span>
== Quests ==

Quests shape a series of stories, rather than a single story. They differ from treasure hunting in that the object of the quest is more elevated, and the process of getting there is as important, and significant for the characters, as the discovery itself. In troupe-style play, a quest is best designed to be split up by stories involving other characters, so that people do not feel that one

<span id="objects-of-quests"></span>
== Objects of Quests ==

* The Holy Grail.
* The cave where Bonisagus devised the Parma Magica.
* The lost rituals of the Cult of Mercury.
* The resting place of one of the Old Ones, powerful magical creatures who died, or fell asleep, millennia ago.
* The fields of Elysium.
* The secret of raising the dead through Hermetic magic.
* The character's father.
* True faith in God.

<span id="xvi-sagas"></span>
== XVI. Sagas ==

saga is a series of connected stories, centered around a single covenant. In some cases the only connection between two stories is that both happen

to people who live at the covenant, and not even the same people. Other stories are linked into a longer narrative, with a major climax. This chapter provides guidance on how to run a good saga.

<span id="background-questions"></span>
== Background Questions ==

hile products from Atlas Games provide a wealth of detail about the background of Ars Magica, there are always areas which are open

to interpretation by individual troupes. In many cases these are matters that can simply be ignored when writing books, but in others it is more a question of how you use a book in your sagas. This section looks at a few of the more significant choices you need to consider when deciding how '''Ars Magica''' works for your troupe.

== history ==

Perhaps the most obvious question concerns how much history you want to use, and how close to historical events you want to stay. Some troupes like to keep mundane history the same as real history, and have the Order of Hermes acting entirely behind the scenes. Others prefer to have the magi change things, so that political events look very different from our history. Still others prefer to change things around entirely.

This is a slightly different issue from the best way to include history in a game (see Making it Historical, page 495). All the hints there apply no matter what you choose, although, obviously, the

more you want to change things, the less you have to worry about anachronisms.

You might want to run a saga which has very little interaction with the mundane world. Mythic Europe, with historical kings and bishops, is there in the background, but most adventures take place in magical auras, faerie forests, or infernal temples. This sort of saga can be very high fantasy without much problem.

At the other extreme, you might want to put the covenant in a major city, such as Paris, Rome, Constantinople, or Jerusalem, and have the player characters deal with the politics and culture of Mythic Europe on a daily basis.

It is even possible to combine the two ideas, although this requires the most work from the storyguide. Many medieval legends are high fantasy, and they can be real in your version of Mythic Europe. You might place the covenant in a version of Constantinople where the city walls really are made of gold and studded with gems, and magical statues and other wizards are a common sight on the streets. This combination is difficult because you need to find medieval legends, and then make medieval society work around them. On the other hand, it is extremely rewarding, and it is possible to do it for one location rather than an entire saga.

The troupe must simply decide whether the magi can change history. The assumption in official books is that the history of Mythic Europe looks, on the surface, like that of medieval Europe until 1220, the canonical starting date. However, many of the reasons behind historical events involve wizards, faeries, and other mystical creatures. The default assumption is that Mythic history will diverge from real history after 1220, as player characters interfere, but that need not be true in your saga.

<span id="the-order-of-dermes"></span>
== The Order of Dermes ==

The Order of Hermes might seem to be very well defined in the books, but in fact a very important question is left vague, for individual troupes to determine. How organized is the Order in practice? In theory, Tribunals, Quaesitors, Redcaps, and the Peripheral Code tie everything together and enforce a myriad rules. In your saga, that might be the case in practice as well, so that player characters who break the Code face punishment, unless they take careful steps to hide their infractions. Individual covenants might have to register with the Tribunal or be forcibly removed, and all new magi might be recorded in a central register.

At the other extreme, Tribunals might be primarily social events, where the Code is only actually enforced if someone has made enemies of virtually every other magus in the area. Magi a century old might frequently appear and announce that they have been members of the Order for decades, and Redcaps might be supported by individual covenants who need messengers, rather than by the Order.

<span id="rules-questions"></span>
=== Rules Questions ===

Another set of questions you need to decide is how you will use the rules.

First, the rules in the Laboratory and Long-Term Events chapters are only used when the saga stretches over a significant period of game time. You don't need to worry about them for your first couple of stories.

Beyond that, the game as written can be played and enjoyed, at least according to the playtesters. However, you might want to add House Rules, to make things better fit your playing style.

For example, the core rules pay very little attention to economics. As written, this is a game about mighty wizards in a world of legends, and they don't have to worry about how much their socks cost. However, you might want to play magical merchants criss-crossing Mythic Europe and building trade routes that support marvelous cities. An excellent concept, but you will have to add House Rules for trade, and the effects of trade on cities. (Or, possibly, buy City &amp; Guild.)

There are some changes you might want to make even if you play something very close to the core game. For example, your group might prefer not to have major events happen purely on the roll of the dice. In that case, you can simply ignore stress dice, and always use a simple die. If you do that, a character's skill will always be the main influence on a situation. Of course, you need to make that clear up front, because a number of Virtues and Flaws rely on the stress die.

More fundamental changes are also possible. In 'canon' (the game as defined by the published rules and supplements) mundane humans have virtually no resistance to magic. You might decide to give all Christians, Jews, and Muslims a Magic Resistance equal to five times the level of the local Dominion aura. This will make it almost impossible for magi to affect someone in a town, and drives a stronger separation of the mundane and the supernatural.

Most gamers find that some features of the game don't suit them perfectly. Making up House Rules to fix this is entirely normal, and even to be encouraged, there are some people who like tinkering with rules almost as much as they like playing. In fact, if your group finds that you have the most fun if you spend several hours a week hashing out new rules to make, for example, the book rules exactly match the latest research on medieval study styles and libraries, and never actually play any characters, then go ahead.

At the other extreme, you might find that worrying about game statistics interferes with the flow of your stories, and things work much better when players just say what their magus does. If that works for you, then you can use the spell guidelines as nothing more than inspiration for the sorts of things your magi might do.

The rules and background for Ars Magica as written do favor a particular style of play, but if that doesn't match your style, you should change the rules and background so that it does.

Catholic church is institutionally continuous with the Western medieval church on which the Mythic version is based, this is a question you should discuss with your troupe, to avoid offending anyone.

The fundamental choice is between a Church which is basically good with a few bad members,

divide. Sagas where the Order tries to overthrow the Church can be exciting, as can sagas where the Order tries to join the Church, or, of course, where the Church simply is not very important to the player characters.

<span id="the-infernal"></span>
== The Infernal ==

How many demons do you want in your saga? Demons and diabolists make excellent unambiguous enemies, but the extent to which you use them has a strong effect on the tone of the saga. If there are demons everywhere and a diabolist in every village, then you have a very dark setting where the characters are surrounded by enemies. On the other hand, one diabolist as the main enemy for a saga can be much more hopeful, as things get better once the enemy is defeated.

You should also consider how you want to play demons. Traditionally, they are interested in souls, but also have a penchant for violence and destruction. Emphasizing the violence makes demons into monsters the player characters have to kill, while emphasizing their efforts to corrupt people makes for much more subtle enemies. Subtle enemies are not necessarily a good thing, your players may not want their characters to wrestle with ambiguous moral choices or struggle with temptation.

<span id="the-fate-of-magic"></span>
== The Fate of Magic ==

A common trope in stories involving a magical past is the decline of magic, so that eventually the magic goes away and leaves us with our contemporary world. The canonical background to '''Ars Magica''' assumes that, if this is happening, it is so slow that no-one has yet noticed it. Magical auras give way to the Dominion in some places, but in others magic grows stronger.

In your saga, magic could be declining, rising, or steady. Steady magic is the least intrusive on play, as either of the others will have a profound influence on a saga full of magi. It is also the default assumption of sourcebooks; magic was neither stronger nor weaker when the Order was founded, and has not changed noticeably since.

On the other hand, the decline of magic can easily be linked to the advance of the Dominion. As western Europe leaves the Dark Ages and civilization starts to spread once more, remote areas that used to be magical wilderness become incorporated into farmland. By 1220 this might no longer be an occasional nuisance, but rather a serious threat to the Order, as auras vanish and vis sources become scarce.

Magic could also be declining along with all the other supernatural powers, in which case the Dominion would suffer as much as the Order of Hermes. Miracles would become less common, fewer demons would appear, and faeries would retreat fully into stories. Such a background sets up a tragedy for magi, unless they have the chance to reverse the decline.

A third option is to have magic on the rise, again either in opposition to the other supernatural auras or in concert with them. This might work well if you

want to start with a saga that is closely tied to mundane historical facts, and increase the level of fantasy later. If only magic increases in power, the player characters might become more powerful than any opposition, but if all the realms increase together the newly-powerful magi will face newlypowerful priests, faeries, and demons, so the challenge remains, just at a greater scale.

<span id="resources-2"></span>
== Resources ==

The resources to which the player characters have access also influence the speed of advancement, although that influence is much lower than the speed of the saga. It doesn't matter how many books or how much vis the characters in a slow saga have; they never have time to study them.

Nevertheless, it is important to give some thought to resources.

Vis comes in two ways: vis finds, which don't renew, and vis sources, which do. Early in the saga it is better to hand out vis finds, rather than sources. You can then keep track of how much the player characters use, and decide how much vis you want them to have, before you hand out sources. Vis finds run out naturally, while sources have to be taken away, which might annoy the players.

Vis amounts are highly saga-dependent, and there is no 'right' way to do it. The following numbers are merely a guideline.

Low Vis: Up to 5 pawns/magus/year. Studying from vis is very rare, and vis-boosting the Penetration of spells is almost unheard of. Only necessary rituals are cast, and enchanted items are uncommon.

Moderate Vis: Around 10 pawns/magus/year. Studying from vis is common, although books are still preferred. Enchanted items can be made fairly easily, the main concern is getting the right kind of vis, not the amount. Rituals can be cast if they are helpful, and in extreme situations the magi might use vis to boost spell Penetration.

HIGH VIs: Around 20 pawns/magus/year. Magi can do pretty much anything they want involving vis. This is probably too much vis for most sagas.

Books also come in two sorts, summae and tractatus, and the analogy goes further than that. Because a tractatus can only be studied once by a given character, you can be fairly sure of the effect that it will have. If you want to keep the rate of power advancement down, restrict the number of summae the covenant has, and don't let the covenant build up a large reserve of tractatus noone has studied yet. In addition, when a magus's Arts reach the point of being as high as you are comfortable with, cut off the supply of books. The magus can still invent spells or learn other Arts, and that buys you time to become accustomed to the new level of power.

Don't forget that magi in a covenant can write books for each other. You shouldn't interfere with such activities, but should take them into account.

<span id="saga-speed"></span>
== Saga Speed ==

dvancement in Ars Magica happens by seasons of game time (see Advancement, page 375), and so the number of seasons of game time that pass

for every game session is an extremely important factor in determining the style of a saga. The ideal saga speed is entirely a matter of troupe preference, but it is important to be aware of the implications in advance. Fortunately it is easy to speed up or slow down a saga if you decide that you have made a mistake.

<span id="slow-saga"></span>
== Slow Saga ==

In a slow saga there are, on average, two or more game sessions per season. Characters do not improve much, and the different lifespans of magi and companions are largely irrelevant.

The main advantage of this style of saga is that the style of play does not have to change much. The main disadvantage is that the laboratory rules, which are central to '''Ars Magica''', will get little use. In addition, players may become frustrated if their characters do not improve. This style is closest to the conventional style of most roleplaying games, and is a good way to start a saga, as it allows everyone to get used to their characters and establish their personalities before time, perhaps, starts to pass more quickly.

If you intend to play a slow saga, Virtues and Flaws affecting study, lifespan, and other seasonal activities in game are much less significant, while those that affect the character's starting scores are much more significant. There is no need to change the classification of any Virtues or Flaws, unless you want to, but players should be aware of the relative importance of the different types when they are creating their characters.

<span id="medium-saga"></span>
== Medium Saga ==

A medium saga has, on average, one to four seasons per game session. Characters do improve, but unless you play very frequently, or over a long period of real time, magi are unlikely to die of old age or pass into Final Twilight.

A medium saga is a good compromise rate, and an excellent way to start, since it is fairly easy to slow down or speed up, as required. Flaws affecting study are of similar significance to those affecting character generation, so players need not pay attention to such subtleties.

In a medium saga it is quite likely that companions and grogs will die of old age, although probably not until the saga is rather advanced. As the characters are likely to have seen extensive play before their deaths, this can create excellent opportunities for roleplaying, and the chance to play the heir of a favored character.

<span id="fast-saga"></span>
== Fast Saga ==

In a fast saga, more than one year passes per game session, on average. In a fast saga, magi rapidly become powerful, and a magus who starts the saga fresh from his gauntlet can expect to die of natural causes before the end. Companions may be played only a handful of times before they die of old age.

In fast sagas, the emphasis is very much on the magi, particularly once they have become powerful. Virtues and Flaws that affect only a character's starting scores are much less important, and should probably be made reclassified or made more effective if they are to be balanced.

Fast sagas are good for players who want to play epic magi who create magical effects which influence the whole of Europe, but they are not a good way to start a saga. In a fast saga, characters change radically almost before you know it, so a slightly slower start is a good way to get to know them. If some members of the troupe are new to Ars Magica, it would be rather difficult for them to manage five or more seasons of study between every game session.

<span id="pulsed-saga"></span>
== Pulsed Saga ==

A pulsed saga combines the fast and slow sagas. A dozen game sessions might cover a single season, but then twelve game years might pass before the next session.

Pulsed sagas have many advantages. The intense bursts of activity give companions and grogs ample opportunities for play, while the long periods of downtime allow characters to study, and magi can advance to high levels of power.

Most sagas are pulsed to some extent, as it is very unusual to hit exactly the average rate every session. It only really becomes a separate style when the contrast between rates becomes extreme. This also creates the main problem with this speed of saga: it can be difficult to provide an in-game reason for everything becoming quiet for years of game time, after the characters have spent a season involved in one adventure every week. If you do want to play a pulsed saga, it is important for the storyguide to work out how each story arc will finish, and why any loose ends will wait years before needing to be resolved.

<span id="troupe-style-roleplaying"></span>
= Troupe-Style Roleplaying =

n a typical roleplaying game one person serves as the gamemaster, while the other participants have one character each, whom they play from session to session.

Troupe-style roleplaying breaks away from those assumptions, and this can make it difficult for experienced roleplayers to get into. There are a number of types of troupe-style play, and while they are listed in ascending order of difference from standard roleplaying this is not meant to suggest that the later forms are better than the earlier. If you want to try the full range, it is probably best to work up through the stages, so that people get used to the differing roles of troupe-style games, but you can also pick a single stage that sits well with your group and simply use that.

If Ars Magica is your first roleplaying game, you should simply select the style that seems most appealing, and then modify it as necessary so that everyone is having fun.

Although none of the styles of troupe-style play are better for everyone, it is almost always better to use some version of troupe-style play rather than conventional play. This is because, although the game is centered on magi, it is very hard to run a whole saga in which the players play their magi in every session. For one thing, it becomes very difficult to challenge a whole group of fairly experienced magi, as at least one member of the group is likely to be skilled at any form of magic. It can be done, but having to do it every session is likely to strain the storyguide. Another problem is that magi like to spend time in their laboratories, and they might well not want to go out at the same time. After a while, it can come to seem rather artificial if everyone drops everything to go on an adventure.

However, if you play in the conventional fashion and some players have non-magi, different problems arise. First, magi are far more powerful than other characters, and get far more attention in the rules. Someone stuck playing a knight might well find his character aging and dying, possibly of boredom, while the magi study magic and create enchanted devices, and even when he does get to see some action he is likely to be overshadowed by the magi in most adventures.

Even the simplest troupe-style play avoids these problems, as every player has a magus and another character. Thus, you should at least try it out.

<span id="alternative-characters"></span>
== Alternative Characters ==

In this version of troupe-style play each player has two or more characters, but only plays one of them in a given session. At least one character should be a magus, and at least one should be a companion (see page 25). There is nothing to stop a player having two magi and four companions, if he can cope with only playing each character once every six sessions or so, and with the book-keeping of keeping each character up to date.

If you play this way, it is essential that a player's characters have good reasons not to go on adventures together. They may dislike each other, but this is not essential. Instead, one player's companion could be closely linked to another player's magus, or the two characters could have very different interests.

This style of play is quite close to conventional roleplaying, in that everyone has their own characters, and no-one is handling more than one character at once. As an extra bonus, it makes it easy for players to introduce new characters if they become tired of an old character or don't like the way he is developing in the saga. This style avoids many of the serious problems that the conventional style raises in '''Ars Magica''', but it can still lead to rather more magi going on an adventure than is ideal.

<span id="pooled-characters"></span>
== Pooled Characters ==

Playing with pooled characters means that, in addition to a player's magi and companions, there is also a 'pool' of grogs and bit-parts, who can be played by anyone. Thus, on a typical adventure, one player might play his magus, a second her companion, while the other two take grogs from the common pool.

This has a number of advantages. First, the number of magi in a group tends to be small, which makes them easier to challenge. Second, the covenant staff get to appear on stage, without condemning anyone to playing bit parts all the time. Third, when playing a grog you can cut loose and enjoy yourself. If you overact and ham up your main character, you are likely to end up annoying the other players. On the other hand, a grog who is hammed up can be restricted to small doses, making him entertaining rather than annoying.

More generally, because a grog is not your main character, it is easier to take major risks, or to do things that you know make the character look stupid. The actions of grogs can be some of the most memorable aspects of adventures. It is also possible to run more than one grog at a time, since they can fade into the background while another character takes most of your playing attention.

From the storyguide's perspective, you can kill grogs to emphasize the seriousness of a situation without killing characters into which the players have invested vast amounts of emotional energy. In games with pooled grogs, grogs are supposed to die. They are played enough for the players to care, but they are not so central that a grog death means a major change in the saga. This applies to other major events; grogs get maimed, go mad, or acquire responsibilities that mean they can no longer go on adventures.

In this style of game it is very important for each pooled grog to be looked after by a single player for development between sessions. It is probably best to start with just one grog per player, and create more as people get more used to using the advancement systems. The player managing the grog's downtime activities gets to say what he does in his time off, and as the number of grogs grows some troupes enjoy spending time on the soapoperatic aspects of the relations between the grogs and the magi.

It is important to remember that Ars Magica's advancement system means that characters do not fall behind in power when they are not played, so that players' primary characters do not lose out when the players are running grogs.

Another major advantage of this style of play is that it can easily handle player absences, particularly if the player warns the troupe in advance. As long as the troupe can get that player's main characters home before the session for which the player is absent, there is no problem

at all, just fewer people to play grogs. The system can even handle players leaving for years to work overseas, their characters fade into the background, spending all their time in the lab, and then can rejoin the saga when the player gets back, still at the same sort of power level as the characters who have been played.

Of course, the game does still rely on the storyguide being available.

<span id="guest-storyguiding"></span>
== Guest Storyguiding ==

The next level of troupe-style playing involves a player occasionally running a session. The normal storyguide can play some of the pooled grogs, and thus remains involved in the game.

This has a major advantage, in that it gives the regular storyguide an occasional break, which can be very good for both creativity and enthusiasm. It also allows someone to have a go at storyguiding without committing to running a whole saga.

There are, however, potential problems. Since the regular storyguide is going to play, the guest storyguide cannot check all the details of the story in advance, so there is a risk of clashing with the regular storyguide's long-term plans.

The best way to avoid such problems is to have the guest storyguides run stories that take place in isolated locations, such as a distant island, or a cave complex. Regiones (page 420) are excellent for this sort of thing, particularly if they can only be entered under rare conditions, so that the characters cannot go back. The guest storyguide should discuss the sorts of rewards and risks that he can include, so as to avoid upsetting the regular storyguide's plans. It is even possible for the guest storyguide to run a story that takes place in a dream, so that it has no long-term effect on the saga at all, but such devices can easily be overused.

<span id="alpha-and-beta-storyguides"></span>
== Alpha and Beta Storyguides ==

The next step is to have more than one member of the troupe acting as storyguide on a regular basis. One storyguide, the alpha storyguide, is responsible for the overall shape of the saga, and has final veto power on story additions, but one or more beta storyguides take responsibility for specific aspects of the saga. A beta storyguide might be responsible for a particular magical regio, or for a local faerie forest, or for the covenant itself, if the characters have joined an old and large institution. As long as the action remains within that location, the beta storyguide has free rein. Some of the participants are still just players, however.

The big advantage of this style is that the alpha storyguide can have a magus and companion, as long as they are designed to go on the sorts of adventures that the beta storyguide runs. In addition, this version of troupe-style play can handle the alpha storyguide's absence as easily

as that of any other player, as long as there is some advance notice.

The alpha and beta storyguides should make sure that they are agreed on the sort of reward level that is appropriate, and on the tone of the saga and its individual parts. There is nothing wrong with making a faerie forest into a comedic part of a saga, as long as everyone is agreed in advance, but introducing laser guns and spaceships is likely to cause problems.

This style has the additional advantage that events can sometimes surprise everyone, including all the storyguides, when the different plots interact in unexpected ways. This is an advantage, in the same way as unexpected player actions are good for a conventional game, but it does mean that the storyguides need to be very flexible.

<span id="pure-troupe-style"></span>
== Pure Troupe Style ==

In the purest form of troupe style, everyone runs games in roughly equal amounts, and there is no alpha storyguide. This requires quite a bit of coordination, and the troupe must decide on a method for resolving disputes in rule interpretation. One possibility is to have one person as the 'rules storyguide', and have her interpretation be final, but a more democratic method might also work if the group is willing to cooperate.

This style gives everyone an equal chance to run the game and play characters, and can handle any anticipated player absences without any trouble. If one player runs out of storyguiding ideas, she can simply play for a while, until something new occurs to her.

Pure troupe style does, however, require a group of players all of whom are comfortable with rules and with running games. This might prove difficult, especially if the troupe recruits new members from time to time.

<span id="researching-a-setting"></span>
= Researching a Setting =

o, you've decided you want to run an '''Ars Magica''' saga. What now? You need to create the covenant, probably with the co-operation of the

players (see page 178), and then you need to put it somewhere. There are a number of options for this, and none is better or worse than the others. You can even switch between them during a saga, either doing more research, or deliberately including more non-historical elements.

<span id="the-pure-fantasy-saga"></span>
== The Pure Fantasy Saga ==

Research needn't involve books and libraries. You can search on the internet, ask questions on discussion forums, or watch historical documentaries on television. This is, after all, a game, so you should research the things you find interesting, in a way you find enjoyable.

You can set your saga in a pure fantasy world. You might adapt a published one to include the Order of Hermes, or create your own. The advantage is that you don't have to worry about historical facts at all, and can have exactly the setting you want. The disadvantage is that the

setting of Ars Magica has even influenced the mechanics, so you will find that you have to adapt or ignore a lot of the game material.

<span id="the-no-research-saga"></span>
== The No-Research Saga ==

Pick a Tribunal for the covenant (see the map on page 493-494). Pick names for the local nobility, towns, and parish church. Decide what sort of geography you want. Use elements from the Mythic Europe chapter (page 495) to make your stories feel medieval. Have fun, and ignore people telling you that the king of England in 1220 wasn't William the Bastard.

<span id="the-low-research-saga"></span>
== The Low-Research Saga ==

Get hold of a modern map of Europe, and pick an area with the sort of terrain you want. Look up twelfth and thirteenth century events in an encyclopedia or general world history, to give you a few names and trends. Most of the cities, towns, and villages in modern Europe were there in the Middle Ages, only smaller, so shrink places. (There are some exceptions, but at this level of research, you don't want to worry about that.) Add more forest. Roads, with the exceptions of freeways/motorways/ autobahn, tend to follow historic routes that sometimes go back to the Romans, so you can use those as described.

From that point, things proceed as for the noresearch saga.

Alternatively, buy one of the Tribunal Books from Atlas Games, and set your saga in that Tribunal. This gives you most of the benefits of the Extreme-Research Saga, with a level of effort more like the Low-Research version.

<span id="the-medium-research-saga"></span>
== The Medium-Research Saga ==

Pick your area from a modern map, as above. Then find a history of that area, and read the chapters on the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This will give you quite a few names, a fair bit of social detail, and some idea of which towns were important back then. Work what you've learned into your saga in a way that will impress your players.

<span id="the-ligh-research-saga"></span>
== The Ligh-Research Saga ==

Once you have chosen your area, get hold of a history of that area that focuses on the twelfth of thirteenth centuries. Reading such a book will probably give you more information than you can possibly include in a saga. More recent histories are better for gaming purposes than older ones, because recent historians tend to pay more attention to what life was like, and to events other than battles and the deaths of kings. Give characters names that match the sorts of names you find in the book, so

that they 'sound right'. Have the repercussions of events you read about affect the covenant. Foreshadow future history, giving the players a chance to change it. And so on.

<span id="the-extreme-research-saga"></span>
== The Extreme-Research Saga ==

Read several single-volume histories of the area in question, to get a more balanced view. Find, and read, histories of specific aspects, such as the history of a single city, or of the law, or of the Church, or even a single monastery. Track down books written in or about your area during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and read them in translation. Learn Latin so that you can read the ones that haven't been translated yet. Learn paleography so that you can read the ones still in manuscript. Go back to university and get a Ph.D. in medieval studies while actually just researching your saga.

Somewhere before the 'learn Latin' stage is the amount of research that most authors do before writing a Tribunal book or similar piece of setting material for the line. For a personal saga, that's a lot of research.

<span id="saga-styles"></span>
== Saga Styles ==

here are a number of different ways of playing Ars Magica, all valid, and many compatible with each other. Indeed, almost any combination is

possible over the course of a saga, particularly as there is nothing wrong with the style of a saga changing over time. The descriptions here are merely intended to give you some ideas, and help you work out what sort of saga you want to play.

<span id="high-fantasy"></span>
== high Fantasy ==

The characters spend much of their time dealing with demons, faeries, giants, dragons, and angels. Powerful, flashy mystical effects are extremely common, dealing with mundanes is not. This works particularly well with a low-research saga, as high fantasy elements have to be made up anyway.

<span id="mundane-interactions"></span>
== Mundane Interactions ==

The characters spend a lot of time dealing with local nobles, churchmen, bandits, and traders. They might worry about whether the covenant has enough cattle to provide the vellum for its library, or be concerned with the trend towards violent antisemitism sweeping the country. Magic might be used a lot, but it tends to be low-key and subtle, even if it is powerful.

<span id="hermetic-life"></span>
== hermetic Life ==

The characters spend most of their time interacting with other Hermetic magi. They might be dedicated politicians in the local Tribunal, bibliophiles trying to gather the finest library in the Order, or Hoplites dedicated to hunting down any magus who turns to diabolism.

<span id="action-adventure"></span>
== Action-Adventure ==

The characters fight and defeat enemies, whether by force of arms or force of magic. They may or may not loot the bodies afterwards.

<span id="investigation"></span>
== Investigation ==

The characters unravel mysteries, discover murderers, and trace the resting place of lost treasures.

<span id="politics-1"></span>
== Politics ==

The characters negotiate with others to get what they want, or to help their allies get what they want.

<span id="creation"></span>
== '''Creation''' ==

The characters are trying to build something, whether abstract or concrete. They might be trying to create the strongest, most vibrant covenant in the Order, or a giant flying ship, or bring justice and peace to a war-torn area of Europe.

<span id="saga-priorities"></span>
== Saga Priorities ==

he highest priority for any saga is to ensure that all the players are having fun. This is much easier if you have good communication between the players, and people

are not afraid to talk about what they do and don't enjoy in the game.

If one player finds certain story elements upsetting or offensive, then you shouldn't include them. If another player finds the absence of the same elements upsetting or offensive, then you have a real problem within the group that you will need to talk about. The historical setting of Ars Magica makes this sort of conflict more likely than it might be in other games. For example, a Christian player might find plot lines that portray the Church as corrupt offensive, but a pagan player might find plot lines that portray the Church as virtuous equally offensive. The only way to resolve such problems is to talk about them, and the resolution might be a decision that Ars Magica is the wrong game for your group.

On a less serious level, different people enjoy different styles of story. The covenant and troupestyle play mean that Ars Magica is well-adapted to covering many styles of story in a single saga, and so this sort of problem can generally be solved within the game. Players should be allowed to adapt their characters, or introduce new ones, if they find that their existing characters do not fit well with the sorts of story they enjoy. On the other hand, if the main storyguide does not enjoy running the kinds of story that certain players want, that might be a good opportunity to try out guest storyguiding. Communication and tolerance are also important for resolving this issue, as players may have to put up with some stories that are not really their thing, so that everyone can have fun.

Finally, &quot;game balance&quot; in Ars Magica is nothing more than a tool for making sure that all the players have fun, by making it hard for one player's character to monopolise the spotlight. Magi are not balanced against companions, but the idea is that everyone will take turns playing their magi and companions, and so the spotlight will move around. This means that you do not need to worry too much about game balance when modifying the rules to suit your play style. As long as the changes help everyone to have fun, they are good.

Roleplaying games are a way to explore other worlds, other perspectives, and other possibilities. But they are, or at least '''Ars Magica''' is, first and foremost entertainment.

Enjoy yourselves.

<span id="editors-note"></span>
== Editor's Note ==

lmost ten years ago I wrote an afterword for ''Dies Irae'' in which I said it was &quot;the last book in the '''Ars Magica''' Fifth Edition line that I will produce as Line Editor&quot;.

Strictly speaking, that remains true: Atlas did not hire me as Line Editor for this book.

When John Nephew approached me three years ago about preparing the manuscript for a definitive edition of the game, it did not take me long to decide that I wanted to do it. While I thought ten years ago, and still think now, that I am the wrong person to create a new edition of Ars Magica, I can claim to be the right person to bring together rules and background scattered across the forty and more books of the Ars Magica Fifth Edition line to create a definitive version of the core rules for that edition. The result is the book that you hold in your hands (or view on your screen, if you have the digital version).

As well as collecting rules, such as those for Mystery Initiation and integrating non-Hermetic magic, that could not be included in the original core rule book because they had not yet been

written, it was also a chance to include clarifications and expansions that had been added over the years.

I also took the opportunity to gather errata from the online Ars Magica community, to correct errors that people had noticed over the last twenty years, and clarify things that had

proved less transparent than I had hoped when originally publishing them.

If you have managed to avoid impostor syndrome so far, spending months gathering errata for books you were responsible for is a very good way to experience it.

This is not a new edition of the game. The fact that we were making a new book allowed me to spend more words on clarification than would have been possible for online errata, and I have made a handful of changes to better integrate rules with each other, but this is still Ars Magica Fifth Edition. All existing supplements remain fully compatible with it, and if you have the entire line and the errata, you already have virtually everything of substance in this book.

Of course, John and Michelle Nephew's decision to release the whole Ars Magica line under an open license means that you will be able to get the text of the definitive edition free of charge. But that is far from being the main benefit.

The open license means that anyone can now write for the game, and make money from their creations. The definitive edition is most definitely not the end of the Fifth Edition line. Rather, it is the foundation for an unlimited future. Most of the final paragraph from my afterword for ''Dies Irae'' applies even more fully now.

&quot;We have created a game line that I think is about as good as we could make it, and it fulfills my vision for '''Ars Magica'''. Its future lies with people who have a different vision, and can bring things to the game that I would not even imagine.&quot;

I plan to be part of that future, as one creator among many.

<span id="fourth-edition-conversion"></span>
== Fourth Edition Conversion ==

onverting from Ars Magica 4<sup>th</sup> Edition to 5<sup>th</sup> Edition is a good idea, because a

lot of longstanding problems in the rules have been fixed. However, that raises the question of what has changed. There are two viable short answers.

<span id="nothing-has-changed"></span>
== Nothing has Changed ==

The game is still about powerful wizards of the Order of Hermes, who live in covenants with Mythic Europe, a world where myth and history mix. Hermetic magic is still based on five Techniques and ten Forms. There are the same Houses of Hermes. Essentially, the summary of the game that you would give to someone who knew nothing about it is exactly the same as it was before. This is as it should be; this is a new edition, not a new game.

<span id="everything-has-changed"></span>
== Everything has Changed ==

On the other hand, the revisions have affected just about every part of the rules and background. Again, this is as it should be, this is a real new edition, not simply a republication with a different cover in the hope of getting people to buy the book again.

<span id="the-long-answer"></span>
== The Long Answer ==

This chapter provides a summary of what has changed between the editions. It doesn't

cover everything, but it should give you an idea of the most important things to look at.

<span id="background"></span>
== Background ==

The twelve Houses of Hermes are now split into three groups: four are Mystery Cults, four are True Lineages, and four are Societates, groups of magi with similar interests. They are still the same Houses as before, however.

Beyond that, the background has changed very little. The Order of Hermes and Mythic Europe chapters have been completely rewritten, but the aim was to say things more clearly, not to say different things.

<span id="character-generation"></span>
==== Character Generation ====

The rules for character generation are very different.

First, Virtues and Flaws no longer have point values; they are split into Major and Minor. In addition, Flaws that create story hooks are now Major Flaws, unless they also have a benefit, in which case they are Minor. This means that a number of –1 Flaws have become Major Flaws, and a number of +1 Virtues have become Minor Flaws. Similarly, Personality Flaws are handled differently.

Abilities now cost five times their (level + 1) to raise by one level. This means that the same advancement rules can be used for both Arts and Abilities.

Characters get a different number of experience points at character generation. The overall result is that characters generated at a certain age, and characters played up to the same age, will be almost the same. This was very far from the case in Fourth Edition. The rules for Confidence have changed.

<span id="covenants-1"></span>
=== Covenants ===

The rules for covenants have been totally redone. They are nothing like the Fourth Edition rules.

<span id="magic-2"></span>
== Magic ==

Spell level is now subtracted from the casting total before determining Penetration. This makes Magic Resistance, and in particular the Parma Magica, much more effective.

The limits of magic have been clarified. The chances are that the official interpretation will differ slightly from your house rules interpretation, given how ambiguous the earlier wording was. The only deliberate change is that Hermetic magic is now incapable of scrying on the past or future.

The scope of the Techniques and Forms has been clarified. In particular, Muto now deals with giving something a property it cannot naturally have, while Rego deals with giving something properties it can naturally have. As a result, spells have moved both ways between the Arts.

Sympathetic magic for Penetration is now in the core rules.

Spell mastery has been completely rewritten.

Certamen no longer has an associated Ability.

Vis boosting of spell ranges, durations, and targets has been cut.

Spell ranges, durations, and targets have been changed and streamlined. The size of a target now has some effect on the spell level. Wards and magical senses are dealt with explicitly.

The spell guidelines have been gone over thoroughly. Many spell levels have changed a bit, some have changed a lot.

All laboratory activities now use the Lab Total. All Lab Texts use the same rules, and learning spells from texts is now a matter of inventing them based on a Lab Text.

There are no separate rules for writing, copying, or learning spells: that is covered by the rules on Lab Texts.

<span id="long-term-quents"></span>
== Long-Term Quents ==

The study rules have been completely revised to get a more sensible advancement rate.

Aging has been changed, to give a sensible distribution of ages at death, and to require less book-keeping.

There are now actual rules for the bad effects of living in high auras or having spells cast on you constantly; this is called &quot;Warping.&quot; These rules integrate with the rules for Wizard's Twilight, which is now the way that Warping affects Hermetic magi.

<span id="combat-3"></span>
==== Combat ====

Combat, as is traditional, has been completely rewritten.

<span id="character-conversion"></span>
==== Character Conversion ====

Fifth Edition characters tend to advance slightly more slowly than Fourth Edition. As a rule of thumb, if you want to mix characters, add 20% to a Fourth Edition character's age, and then convert as follows.

Characteristics: Characteristics are unchanged between Fourth and Fifth Editions.

Virtues and Flaws: Convert each Virtue or Flaw to its new status. If this results in an unbalanced character, discuss suitable modifications with your troupe.

Abilities: Leave at the old value, and multiply remaining XP by five. Spread the XP from removed Abilities among the replacements, as desired.

Arts: No need to change. Spells: Note new levels. Spells a character can no longer cast (some have changed Arts) should be replaced with ones he can, of the same level as the old spell.

Twilight: Divide the number of Twilight Points by three, and use this as the Warping Score.

Average. Talented or skilled characters succeed about 70% of the time, unskilled characters have little chance of success, and moderately skilled characters have about a 50% chance of success.

Hard. Unskilled characters always fail, and moderately skilled characters normally do, unless they are very talented. Skilled characters fail about half the time.

Very Hard. Even moderate skill gives almost no chance of success. Skilled and talented characters fail about half the time, but very skilled, highly talented characters succeed about 70% of the time.

Impressive. People at the top of a skill succeed about half the time. Those with lesser abilities have next to no chance.

Remarkable. Very skilled, highly talented characters only succeed occasionally.

Almost impossible. The greatest masters of a skill succeed when they get lucky.

Disaster: You fail miserably. Consult the following table for the result, depending on the number of zeroes rolled on the botch dice. Suffer the effect for the number you roll and for all lower numbers, unless explicitly told otherwise. For example, an explosion (3) also destroys the creation and inflicts Warping Points on the magus.

<span id="zeroes-result"></span>
==== Zeroes Result ====

* Everyone in the lab gains Warping Points equal to the number of zeroes on the botch roll. Hermetic magi (and anyone else opened to the Hermetic Arts) must roll for Twilight if they gain two or more, members of other traditions may also suffer serious effects, as determined by their tradition. The season is completely wasted, see Complete Failure. If there are other results and magi choose not to resist Twilight, they enter Twilight before the effects occur, and thus avoid any personal damage.
* 2 Your creation is destroyed. If it is a single-season project, this is the same as a Complete Failure.
* 3 Your laboratory gains the Damaged Flaw.
* 4 Explosion! Your laboratory gains the Wrecked Flaw (instead of the Damaged Flaw), and anyone in the laboratory takes two Heavy Wounds.
* 5+ The storyguide picks one of the following: A story event threatens the whole covenant. This may arise immediately from the explosion (a mundane fire, for example), or may be a lingering after-effect of the uncontrolled magic, causing a story some time later.

The explosion completely destroys the laboratory. The structure gains the Deformed and Unstable Flaws, and the whole laboratory must be rebuilt from nothing, rather than gaining the Wrecked Flaw. Anyone in the laboratory takes an additional Incapacitating Wound.

No Extraordinary Effects: Your experiment works without producing any unintended effects.

Side Effect: Your magical creation acquires a side effect. Roll a simple die, and work out the specifics with the storyguide.

<span id="roll-result"></span>
==== ROLL RESULT ====

* 1 Your sigil is exaggerated to many times its normal strength, becoming a significant portion of the effect.
* 2-3 The effect has a minor flaw. For example, a spell that allows you to communicate with animals causes you to retain some of the animal's speech patterns for a time after the spell ends.
* 4-5 The spell has a minor side effect. For example, a spell that controls an animal causes grass to grow under its feet.
* 6 The spell has a minor side benefit. For example, a wind spell has a pleasant smell and makes flying insects uncomfortable.
* 7 The spell has a major flaw. For example, a healing spell causes its targets great pain.
* 8 The spell has a major side effect. For example, a plant control spell attracts all birds in 100 paces.
* 9 The spell has a major side benefit. For example, a spell that transforms you into a wolf also lets you speak to all beasts while a wolf.
* 10 The spell has a fatal flaw. For example, an invisibility spell makes you glow.

No Benefit: Your experimentation produces no results. You lose the benefit of the extra die and risk modifier — recalculate your Lab Total without those modifiers. If your new Lab Total is too low to succeed in the project, it must be abandoned.

Complete Failure: You get nothing from your efforts, and your season is wasted. If you were working on a familiar or enchanted item, roll a simple die. On a 0, it is destroyed.

'''Special or Story Event''': The storyguide picks one of the following.

* The creation requires additional raw vis. The magus must spend a number of additional pawns of vis that match the Technique or Form of the project equal to the magnitude of the effect (including modifications) plus the risk modifier. If he is unable to do so, either because he does not have the vis, or because he cannot handle enough vis in a single season, treat as a Complete Failure.
* The magus also creates a spell, with the same Technique and Form as the project, of any level that he could create in a single season. The spell is designed by the storyguide or troupe, and need not have an obvious connection to the project. The magus knows it, and can write up the Laboratory Text as normal, allowing other magi to create it as well. It is simpler if this spell does follow all the rules of Hermetic Magic, but that is not essential if the troupe is happy with the complications. Treat this as No Extraordinary Effects for the main project.
* The creation is modified in some way that does not necessarily fall under the categories of Side Effect or Modified Effect, although it may if desired. This allows the storyguide to introduce any sort of supernatural effect the creation could even be strongly affected by a different realm. The result may be positive or negative from the magus's perspective, but should be interesting for the troupe.
* A story event happens. This can be anything; it could be used as an opportunity to introduce a major plot line, or as a brief and amusing distraction. It does not need to happen immediately; the uncontrolled magic might set something in motion, or it might be a result of using the creation in a particular context, some time later. The story event may be basically positive the magus might attract the attention of a potential familiar, for example. Unless the story event requires otherwise, treat this as No Extraordinary Effects for the project itself.

'''Discovery:''' Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier. If you are engaged in Arcane Discovery (See ''ArMD'' p277), you make a discovery that advances your project, and ignore this table.

<span id="roll-result-1"></span>
==== ROLL RESULT ====

* 1–4 You gain 15 experience points in Magic Theory.
* 5–6 You gain 15 experience points in some Ability related to the experiment
* 7–8 You gain three experience points in one of the Arts used in the experiment.
* 9 You gain enough experience points to bring one of the Arts used in the experiment to the next level (or three experience points, whichever is greater).
* 10+ Roll twice, and reroll this result if it is generated again.

Modified Effect: Roll a simple die and add your risk modifier. If you were investigating a magic item, you have changed one or more of its powers.

<span id="roll-result-2"></span>
==== ROLL RESULT ====

* 1–3 The spell or effect is reduced in range, duration, target, or potency.
* 4–6 The spell or effect's range, duration, target, or potency is increased.
* 7–8 The use of the spell or effect is restricted. For example, it fails to work in certain circumstances, like when it is raining.
* 9–10 The actual effect of your experiment is modified. For example, a spell like Curse of Circe (p131/p334) turns the target into a goat instead of a pig.
* 11+ The actual effect of your experiment is changed completely, save that the relevant Technique and Form remain unchanged, and the level remains similar.
