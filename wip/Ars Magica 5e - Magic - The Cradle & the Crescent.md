#### **Author Biographies**

**Niall Christie** is (still) a medieval Islam historian who lives in Vancouver, Canada. He likes books, history (no surprise there), roleplaying, tyranids, singing, and tormenting his students with antiquated pop-culture references that they don't get. Niall would like to thank his co-authors and the line editor for all their help, and in particular for picking up the magic lamp that he dropped; and also Guy Le Strange and Muhammad ibn Jubayr, invaluable guides through the desert. He would like to dedicate his portion of this book to three people: to Matt Ryan, for setting this genie free; to Angus MacDonald, for much sheik, rattle, and roll; and to Steph van Willigenburg, for being his Water of Life.

**Erik Dahl** lives in a strange, far-off land with its own rules of magic and its own order of exotic wizards who are surely secretly plotting to take over Mythic Europe. His contributions to this book were inspired by and dedicated to the participants of Grand Tribunal America 2008, which took place August 15–17 in Berkeley, California, and included: Jerry Braverman, Paul Briscoe, Toshi Casey, Niall Christie, Mark Faulkner, Sally Hutchinson, Kurt Konegen, Angus MacDonald, Mark Pascual, John Post, Thomas Scott, Chris Van Horn, Eric Vesbit, and Debbi Winslow. Many thanks to all of you, for your help in establishing such a memorable and enjoyable magical tradition! ARS MAGICA AWESOME EST.

The jinni known as Jarkman (**Lachie Hayes**) hails from far beyond the Mountains of Qaf, in a city where it always rains and seasons change within a day. Perhaps one day he'll master the Travel magic to attend a Grand Tribunal, but until then he'll stick to Storytelling. Lachie thanks Niall for summoning him into this circle, then letting him loose to make mischief. He also thanks his other co-authors Alex, Erik, and Mark for their help and support along the way. Special thanks to Timothy Ferguson for inspiring Lachie to start writing seriously and helping him understanding faeries, which was invaluable for the Jinn and Silk Road chapters. Apologies to Marko and the Light of Andorra crowd for disappearing without explanation just as the saga got going — now you know why. Lachie would most like to thank his wife, for putting up with Middle Eastern medieval madness. This is his first book for **Ars Magica**.

**Mark Shirley** is the descendent of Robert Shirley who, with his brothers, sold cannons to Shah Abbas of Persia on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I. Robert married the Shah's ward, Teresia, a Circassian princess, and became the shah's ambassador to Christendom. Mark feels his Persian bloodline, though many generations diluted, enhanced his enjoyment of writing for this project.

**Alexander White** has an Honours degree in medieval and classical history, and a Master of Public Policy and Management from the University of Melbourne. In between occasionally publishing *Sub Rosa* (an **Ars Magica** fan magazine), Alex works as the campaigns coordinator for the National Tertiary Education Union in Melbourne, Australia.

## *Chapter One*

# *Introduction & Sagas*

*Ahlan wa sahlan!* Welcome to *The Cradle and the Crescent*, the guide to the Mythic Middle East for **Ars Magica Fifth Edition**. This book explores a part of the Mythic world beyond the control of the Order of Hermes, including the lands known in the modern day as the "cradle of civilization," from which our earliest records of human civilization stem — the lands to the east of the Hermetic Tribunal of the Levant, lands known in Europe only through occasional accounts of pilgrims and other travelers, supplemented by a multitude of (at times wild) rumors and speculations.

In this book we present this region as a setting for **Ars Magica** sagas. We describe the geography and history of the area, including in particular many of its mystical sites and supernatural denizens. We also give particular attention to Mythic Middle Eastern magic, the jinn, Mythic Zoroastrianism, and the *Suhhar Sulayman* that is also known as the Order of Suleiman.

# *How to Use This Book*

This book is intended as a full-blown setting for sagas and adventures, with the expectation that it will be a source for stories set within the region. The text assumes that there is no existing Hermetic presence in the area but, throughout the book, you will find story seeds that are intended to draw Hermetic magi and their followers away from their covenants and lead them to the lands of the Middle East. The following are just some of the possibilities that this book offers to players of **Ars Magica** sagas.

First, you may simply use the rules

here to develop exotic characters to supplement your covenant's membership, be they spirit-summoning sahirs*,* impetuous jinn*,* or mysterious Zoroastrian mobeds (see Chapters 3, 4, and 5, respectively)*.*

Second, this book provides tools for you to build an exotic story arc, or exciting adventures set in the region or the supernatural realms it contacts, as a diversion from a conventional Europe-based saga. You may also choose to use the information on Middle Eastern magic and the Order of Suleiman to develop powerful non-Hermetic antagonists or allies for your saga.

Alternatively, you may wish to set your entire saga in the region, in the form of a new covenant of Hermetic magi striking out into lands previously unexplored by the Order, encountering the various challenges and magical traditions of the area.

Finally, and most adventurously, you can cast Hermetic magi aside entirely, playing a group of Middle Eastern mages and their companions seeking to make a name for themselves, and immersing your troupe entirely in the region.

We have not given full details on every place, creature, or supernatural item found within this book. We have given suggested statistics for some of these, but in many cases the precise statistics will depend on the power level of your saga. Thus our main emphasis has been on providing the legends and stories that may be used as inspiration.

# *On the Setting*

In the minds of the people of Mythic Europe, the Middle East is a distant and strange place, home to all manner of monsters, spirits, sorcerers, and kings — full of great wonders for those who are brave enough to seek them out. This book reflects this perception by heightening the level of supernatural activity in the region. Most people of the Mythic Middle East have no less respect for the supernatural than do their counterparts in the West, but they are also much more used to encountering such elements. By adopting this vision of the region we will frequently be doing violence to the historical realities of the period, though many of the supernatural elements that we mention are based on beliefs and ideas expressed in historical sources from the time. However, it is important to remember that this is not a book on Middle Eastern history; it is instead a supplement for the **Ars Magica** roleplaying game that merely draws inspiration from the historical texts.

## *Strangers in Foreign Lands*

Broadly speaking, characters who are members of other faiths living under Islam follow the usual guidelines for character creation, although very few are members of the nobility, and none may be members of the religious classes. Many Christians living under Islam are involved in the civil administration, while many Jews are merchants.

The Jews are, for the most part, orthodox Rabbinites, though some Karaites do still live in the region. The Exilarch — the spiritual head of the Jewish community lives in Baghdad, making it an important city for the Jews, at least in theory.

The situation with regard to the Christians is rather more complex, as there are a large number of different Christian groups living in the region covered by this book.


## *Muslim Views of Europeans*

Muslim relations with the Europeans, whom they call *ifranj* (i-FRANJ) or Franks, regardless of country of origin, are best described as mixed. Some Muslims are openly hostile towards ifranj, particularly during periods of conflict, but others have established more friendly relations. Some rulers find they benefit from diplomatic and mercantile contact with the European states, and one even occasionally finds Muslim and European rulers allying with one another against other Muslim or European rulers. Those Muslims who have had closer contact with Europeans tell tales of strange and unfathomable customs and practices that make little sense to the Muslim mind.

*The Cradle & The Crescent*

Melkites (Greek Orthodox) are most often found in Byzantine territory and the Levant, but there are some scattered communities further east, left over from the days when the Byzantines controlled territories in the northern Jazira, Armenia, and Georgia. Jacobites (Syrian Orthodox) are most often found in Syria and the Holy Land, but some Jacobites may be found in Arabia. Ethiopian Christianity has made some inroads into southwestern Arabia. The Church of the East (Nestorian Christianity) is most significantly represented in Iraq and Persia, outside of the former Roman and Byzantine empires.

Tensions among these various branches of Christianity and Judaism, and indeed among different groups of Muslim and Zoroastrian believers as well, could lead to stories as members of different factions attempt to employ the characters in order to gain an advantage over their rivals. Schisms over points of doctrine can easily flare up into violence, especially if supernatural forces become involved.

Almost all non-Muslim characters living under Muslim rule must also take the Minor General Flaw Dhimmi (DHIMme), described at the end of ths chapter. Exceptions tend to be those outside the social order, and hence beyond or beneath the notice of the Muslim authorities. Hermetic magi are the most obvious examples of such exceptions.

## *Social Structure*

The nominal head of the Muslim world, at least for Sunnis, is the caliph in Baghdad. Serving him (at least theoretically) are the governors of various territories known as *sultans* (sul-TAWNZ). Both the caliph and these rulers are served by viziers, who run their civil and military administration for them. Beneath the caliph, sultans*,* and viziers are three main classes involved in running society: the military elite, the civil elite, and the religious elite (also called the *'ulama'* ('u-la-MEH'), "the erudite," sing.*'alim* ('EH-lim)). Each class is arranged in an approximate hierarchy, though not in such a rigid fashion as in Europe. There are several other groups in Islamic society. The peasants, or *fallahun* (fal-leh-HOON), work the land, much like European peasants. They are free subjects of the ruler, not bound to the land in the way that some European peasants are. Merchants ply their trade in cities.

The Muslim world is home to many who follow a number of other faiths, including Christians and Jews. These people are designated in Islamic law as *ahl al-kitab* (AHL-ul-ki-TEHB), "the people of the




## *The Mythic Middle East in Ars Magica*

This is not the first supplement to deal with topics Middle Eastern, and players may find it helpful to consult other **Ars Magica** supplements when running sagas that make use of the material contained herein. This section lists the supplements that contain significant content pertaining to the Middle East.

#### **Realms of Power: The Divine**

This is the most important supplement in this regard, containing information on both the mundane and supernatural characteristics of the three major monotheistic faiths, all of which have their origins in the greater Middle Eastern region, either the Holy Land, within the Tribunal of the Levant, or Arabia, far beyond its borders, and all of which have members who live in the area covered by this supplement. The rules presented on character creation are also of particular use, especially for generating Muslim and Jewish characters from the Middle East.

#### **Realms of Power: The Infernal**

This book also provides much information that will be useful for Middle Eastern sagas. In addition, it contains some background information on the Jinn (page 26) and includes rules that may be used to create infernally corrupted Jinn. It also gives information on the Mazzikim, a group of demons that include some infernal Jinn in their ranks (page 73), and describes a demoness who masquerades as a jinniyya (Aqrab the Conjuror, pages 58-59). A Zoroastrian demon, Naonhaithya, is also detailed (pages 73-74). In addition, it details a Middle Eastern Infernal tradition, the Mulhidun (pages 136-137), who are found principally in the Jazira.

#### **Realms of Power: Magic**

This book contains rules that may be used to create Magical Jinn, including some commentary on these creatures (pages 106-107 in particular).

#### **Realms of Power: Faerie**

This book contains information that may be used to create Faerie Jinn and those who deal with them. It also contains examples of Middle Eastern faeries, Lamashtu (page 64-65) and the Ghula (page 72); describes how to create characters with Ghula Blood (page 106); and provides various suggestions for incorporating elements from Middle Eastern folk tales into **Ars Magica** sagas.

#### **The Mysteries Revised Edition**

This book includes a number of mysteries that draw on the magical traditions of the Middle East. These include Hermetic Alchemy (pages 39-46) and Hermetic Astrology (pages 47-57), and a journey to the east could form an appropriate part of an Initiation Script for both the Order of the Green Cockerel and the Magoi of the Star. By the same token, the Legion of Mithras (pages 118- 22), should it ever decide to explore its possible links to ancient Zoroastrianism, could require Initiates to travel to Persia to investigate as an Initiation Quest.

# **Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults**

This book includes brief information on the Keepers of Tales, a Merinita subtradition originating in the Middle East (pages 81-82). It also presents the Criamon Path of Walking Backwards, which was inspired by Sufi mysticism, along with information on its founder, the Primus Abdkypris (pages 56 and 70-73).

#### **Houses of Hermes: Societates**

The description of the Hermetic sahirs in *Houses of Hermes: Societates*, while concerning itself with an Iberian tradition of Islamic magi, also includes information on the Jinn, including a sample character, Wahhab (pages 133-136).

#### **Ancient Magic**

This book describes some of the magical secrets that might be found in the region covered by this book, including the language of Adam, ancient Babylon, the Garden of Eden and Cain (pages 10-29); a source of Grigori magic on Mount Ararat (pages 70-73) and the Altars of Alexander the Great (page 125). Information on some of the naming conventions used in the Middle East may also be found (page 46). On more on names, see also Appendix A in this book.

#### **Hedge Magic Revised Edition**

This book describes two traditions of Islamic elementalists, the *Ikhwan al-Safa'*  and the *Tulab ibn Sina* (pages 28-32). Middle Eastern counterparts to Folk Witches (pages 33-53), Learned Magicians (see pages 79-99) and Mythic Alchemists (page 100) are possible with only minor modifications to fit an Islamic setting. Characters descended from nomadic shamans of the northern steppe tribes or deep deserts of Arabia may be represented by the rules for Nightwalkers (pages 102-118).

#### **Rival Magic**

This book gives details about Soqotra, an island in the Gulf of Aden south of Yemen ruled by non-Hermetic sorcerers and their magical tree spirit companions. This book also details the Amazons and their magical tradition descended from Trianoma's sister Veia — the warrior women are based on an island in the Sea of Khazars (the Caspian Sea) but hunting parties may have ranged into Khwarazm or further. Both groups may be potential allies or enemies in sagas set in the Mythic Middle East.


book," and are permitted to live in Muslim lands as long as they accept the status of dhimmis. The subject peoples are required to pay a special poll tax, the *jizya* (JIZ-ya), and to abide by a number of restrictions in society, including refraining from bearing arms, riding animals with saddles, building new places of worship, or attempting to convert others to their faith. Their ability to testify in court is restricted, and the value of their testimony is less than that of Muslim men. Sometimes they are also required to wear distinctive dress. How strictly these restrictions are actually enforced varies from ruler to ruler.

## *Islam & Islamic Law*

Islam is both a religion and a social contract, and so the law humans should use to regulate their lives is contained in its teachings. There are a number of sources Muslims use for this law, which is called in Arabic *al-shari'a* (ash-sha-REE-'a).

#### **Crime and Punishment**

The shari'a divides crimes into three main categories:

- **• Deliberate killing or wounding**, giving the victim or their family the right to exact vengeance, under the control of the authorities. In some cases, vengeance can be replaced by a ransom.
- **• Accidental killing or wounding**, dealt with by financial settlement.
- **• Five major crimes**, dealt with using canonical penalties called *hudud* (hu-DOOD). They include theft (punished by cutting off the right hand), brigandage (death, if a murder involved; otherwise as theft), adultery (stoning or flogging), false accusation of adultery (flogging), and use of alcohol (flogging).

Some other crimes also incur severe penalties. For example, apostasy is punished by death. Less serious offenses are punished with a verbal reprimand. Islamic law often requires a number of witnesses to a crime, making it difficult to impose penalties without adequate proof and moderating the more severe penalties somewhat.

Magic is permitted in Islam, as long as it is used for good purposes. Use of magic for evil purposes, on the other hand, is punishable by beheading. Thus, while Dominion auras generated by Muslims affect magic as normal, the attitude of the Muslim inhabitants of these auras toward practitioners of magic is likely to be more nuanced. In particular, an accusation of use of evil magic is likely to be subject to the same legal processes as any other alleged crime.

#### **The Pillars of Islam**

The Muslim life is encapsulated in five basic duties, known as *arkan al-islam* (ar-KEHN-ul-is-LEHM), or the pillars of Islam. These are as follows:

- *• Shahada* (sha-HEH-da), or testimony: Muslims witness to their faith through two statements, which signify conversion to the faith. These are "*la ilaha illa Allah*" (there is no god except God) and "*Muhammadun rasul Allah*" (Muhammad is the messenger of God). These are repeated regularly as part of the ritual prayers.
- *• Salat* (sa-LAWT), or prayer: Muslims must perform ritual prayer five times every day, at fixed times.
- *• Zakat* (za-KEHT), or alms-tax: All Muslims who are able are required to give a portion of their wealth as charity. Exactly where it is actually directed varies, depending on the political and social situations in any given place.
- *• Sawm* (SOWM), or fasting: All ablebodied Muslims are required to fast during Ramadan (ra-ma-DAWN), the

## *The Unholy Trinity*

Medieval European Christians had many misconceptions about Islam, perhaps the most common of which was that Muslims worshiped an unholy trinity composed of three deities known as Mahound, Termagant, and Apollyon. In **Ars Magica** these three figures are demons of the Order of False Gods (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 37), who seek to foment hostility between Christians and Muslims. They may be found operating anywhere within Europe or the Middle East, whispering their vicious lies into the ears of any who might listen. Like most False Gods, the demons usually take forms that will appeal to their listeners. In their original forms, though, they appear as follows:

• The demon **Mahound** takes the form of a grotesque parody of a monotheistic prophet, clothing itself in fine robes of green silk and gold, and leering at those around it. It has immense ears, intended to mock the fact that such prophets heard the divine revelation.

- **• Termagant** takes the form of a hag with an incredibly wrinkled face and bulging eyes, literally spitting venom at any who oppose it. It has sharp, jagged fingernails with which it claws at its opponents' eyes.
- **• Apollyon** appears on first glance to be a twisted parody of the Greco-Roman Apollo, a hunchbacked, hideously ugly blond man with a lyre,

dressed only in an oversized, ill-fitting golden cloak. The cloak drips with acid and the lyre produces jangling dissonances that set teeth on edge and paralyze the senses.

This unholy trinity might form a suitable arch-enemy in a saga, particularly one that draws characters from western Mythic Europe into the lands of the Mythic Middle East and involves characters with both Christian and Muslim friends and allies. Characters are likely to spend much of their time promoting friendly relations between these groups while seeking to track down and combat those who are nurturing discord.



ninth month of the Muslim year and the month when Muhammad first began to receive the revelation. Fasting is undertaken from sunrise to sunset, and includes abstention from food, drink and sexual activity.

*• Hajj* (HADJ), or pilgrimage: All Muslims who are able are required to make the major pilgrimage to Mecca at least once during their lives. Further details on the hajj are given in the section on the Hijaz in the Mecca section (See Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia).

Each pillar has associated mechanical effects, detailed further in *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 106-108.

#### **Mosques**

Mosques serve several purposes, for in addition to prayer one finds other activities taking place in them, including public orations, readings of the *Qur'an*, Sufi rituals, and religious festivals.

A mosque generally takes the form of an open central space, usually a courtyard or hall, surrounded on three sides by a pillared arcade and on the fourth side, which is the one closest to Mecca, by an open, pillared hall. In the wall closest to Mecca there is a *mihrab* (MIH-rahb), or prayer niche, which indicates the way which worshipers should face when praying, and a *minbar* (MIN-bar), or pulpit, from which sermons are preached. A mosque also often has a water source for ablutions, frequently in the form of a fountain or pool in the courtyard.

Mosques have a Dominion aura that varies in power according to their size and importance. Most mosques have a Dominion aura of 4, while major, famous mosques will usually have auras of 5, though this may increase by a point or two if relics are kept in them. The auras of mosques increase if prayer is performed in them or if those inside are performing the Ramadan fast.

# *Building Sagas*

The Mythic Middle East is a settting that's ripe for long-running **Ars Magica** sagas. Encourage your player characters to build a new Hermetic covenant in these lands, explore conflict and alliances between the wizards in a mixed group of Hermetic magi and sahirs, or make all your characters members of the Order of Suleiman and their servants. The Mythic Middle East awaits you!

## *Founding a Covenant in the Mythic Middle East*

Founding a Hermetic covenant in the potentially hostile lands of the Mythic Middle East creates a challenging starting scenario. While perhaps better suited for more experienced troupes, this option adds the elements of direct potential magical confrontation, isolation from the wider Order, and the tantalizing option of non-Hermetic integration and discovery into a conventional beginning. Combining great freedom with great danger, such Sagas would rely heavily on cooperation among individual magi to survive and prosper. A group of Seeker magi from various backgrounds looking to delve into the ancient non-Hermetic mysteries of the cradle of civilization would be an example of this. An isolated area, such as the deeper deserts (see Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia and Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia) or the less-settled eastern provinces (see Chapter 9: On the Silk Road), may be the most suitable location for a Hermetic colony.



Similar to founding a new covenant, but relying on the tradition begun in the Greater Alps and prevalent in the Rhine, this option is perhaps more attainable for a starting troupe. Sponsorship by one of the established Greater Alps covenants, one of the domus magna, or perhaps the highly resourced and expansionistic Fengheld covenant of the Rhine would be a prerequisite. This scenario trades off some of the danger and isolation by sacrificing freedom — having the young magi beholden to the politics and agendas of senior magi and the wider Order in what is an unstable and charged region. The chapter house may act as an offensive bridgehead, an embassy to the Order of Suleiman, a trading post, an original research base, a translation school or a combination of these ideas. For an existing European saga, this option provides an introduction to the Mythic Middle East and the potential for long-term play without requiring too much initial commitment or research on the part of the storyguide or players. This scenario is dependent on some form of constant link between the Hermetic colony and the motherhouse such as a Mercere Portal, although such a gateway creates a large security liability should the covenant's defenses be breached.

#### **Itinerant Covenants**

This choice reflects a group of mobile magi and provides almost unlimited choice of adventures and the opportunity to fully explore the material contained in this book. The lack of a permanent settlement may create issues for Hermetic magi heavily interested in laboratory work, and both mundane and supernatural security issues come to the fore. This scenario may work best for a more low-magic style saga where the stories are predominantly companion-based or require magi with more diplomacy than magical firepower. The covenant may be posing as simple merchants, acting as an advanced reconnaissance party for the Order, or pursuing another explicit magical goal that requires travel through the Mythic Middle East. The Itineris Serica covenant (see sidebar in Chapter 9: On the Silk Road) details a suggestion for a Seeker covenant dedicated to discovering the mythical land of Serica, at the end of the fabled Silk Route.

#### **Joining a House of Wisdom**

Perhaps the most complex and provocative of Hermetic-based scenarios, in this option a small group of magi join an existing *bayt al-hikma* ("House of Wisdom," pl. *buyut*) of agreeable sahirs. As the Houses of Wisdom are places of teaching as well as gathering places for unGifted sahirs, Gifted magi may be welcome as fellow scholars if they agree to respect their culture and laws of their hosts. Such an inter-Order community creates numerous tensions and conflicts, although it is possible that the group may be able to cooperate and prosper despite the considerable external pressures and initial differences. Magical techniques may be compared and traded, although teaching the Parma Magica to an outsider would spark a violent Wizard's War and March against the traitors unless the sahirs agreed to join one of the Societates or Mystery Cults of the Order first.

## *Tales of Two Orders*

There are several scenarios that could potentially involve Hermetic magi with their Order of Suleiman counterparts in the Mythic Middle East, ranging from overt conflict or guerilla warfare, to uneasy standoff, through to diplomatic overtures and peaceful cooperation and alliance. See Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman for further details on sahirs and their culture.

## *Soft Places: Tales into the Supernatural*

*The Thousand and One Nights* tells of Baluqiya, son of the once-Jewish king of Cairo, who traveled far beyond the mortal world. Led by the mythical jinniyya known as the Queen of Serpents, the prince walked across seas, over mountains, and through deserts to magical lands and kingdoms ruled by giants and jinn alike. Criamon magi believe that this oral legend, like their own *Travels of Fedoso*, is an allegorical description of a journey into the Magic Realm to outside the Circle of Time. Merinita magi of the Keepers of Tales cult disagree, claiming that the White Lands, Mountains of Qaf, and other countries alluded to in the myth lie within the Faerie realm, bordering on or being part of Jinnistan. Jinn of all Realms act as guardians, guides, and sponsors of such stories and are integral to journeys into these mystical locales.

Whatever the truth behind such tales, the Mythic Middle East abounds with portals both physical and metaphorical into the supernatural Realms of Faerie and Magic. Golden Baghdad lies as a Faerie reflection of the mundane city, swarming with characters from the tales and folklore of the region. Merchants ply trade routes that cross supernatural borders and return with fabulous treasures from fantastic and mysterious lands.

Rumors abound of portals into Faerie or the Magic Realm contained *within* the books containing the various tales — whether this represents a non-Hermetic ritual effect instilled by the sorcerers among the jinn or if the books are actually an unusual form of faery acting as Threshold Guardians is unclear.

In the Mythic Middle East, the characters of the Arabian Nights are not just stories — they are woven into the everyday landscape. The player characters in turn are the threads that weave themselves into the fabric of the existing tales adding highlights and accents. This book is the loom on which you, the storyguide, can create a tapestry of adventure to rival the greatest adventures of Haroun al-Raschid, Sinbad and Mar'auf the Cobbler.

See Chapter 4: The Jinn for more details on the jinn and their lands.


## *War on Two Fronts?*

The requirements on a member of the Order of Suleiman are less strict than those of the Order of Hermes, requiring only the demonstration of some form of summoning power. However, although the Code may permit joining the Order of Suleiman, any Hermetic magi undertaking a second oath may be viewed with extreme suspicion. Likewise, although non-Hermetic sahirs may find sponsorship into House Ex Miscellanea, they will face opposition from hostile Hermetic elements such as House Flambeau and even their lost cousins, the Hermetic sahirs of Iberia. Thus despite being able to achieve internal harmony, such a group of mixed magi may find itself ostracized by both Orders, facing powerful enemies on two separate fronts.

#### **The Hermetic Crusades**

The conflict between medieval Christendom and Islam is not completely confined to the Levant and Egypt. Hermetic magi have become aware of the Order of Suleiman through the supernatural actions of individual Syrian sahirs in battles between the invading Franks and the local forces of Salah al-Din. Seeking to trace back this threat to its source, more aggressive Hermetic magi may seek to penetrate behind the battle lines to combat their perceived enemies on their home turf. Others may seek out the legendary armies of Prester John said to dwell far to the east, or search for allies among the encroaching Mongol horde. Even now, a major war against the Order of Hermes may be brewing.

#### **The Followers of the Circle Return**

Although isolated from their eastern brethren since the early tenth century, the Hermetic sahirs of Iberia have not forgotten their origins, even if their knowledge of Solomonic Magic has long since faded beneath the protection of the Code of Hermes. Younger Iberian sahirs opposed to the reconquest of their lands by the northern Christian principalities may seek out their lost eastern brethren for support or magical weapons to use in the war to defend Andalusia from the vengeful scions of Alfonso the Battler and Flambeau the Founder. The successful involvement of the Order of Suleiman in the Iberian conflict would have wide-reaching consequences for the relationship between the two Orders, potentially precluding any attempts at peace for decades to come.

#### **An Hermetic Embassy?**

In 1220, a new danger breaks in the east — the latest in a wave of nomadic hordes from the mysterious steppes. Led by the mysterious figure known as Genghis Khan, the Mongols first begin their assault on eastern Islam but reports of their savagery begin to filter back to western Mythic Europe. Despite their differences, the Order of Hermes and the Solomonic magi may see the threat of the encroaching Mongols as great enough to force an alliance, at least temporarily. Such enforced cooperation and intermingling may have profound effects on the culture, magic and future of the two great supernatural organizations of Mythic Europe. Will such an uneasy truce last long enough to stave off the nomad threat?

## *Magi of a Different Order*

Although the majority of material in this book is designed for use with Hermetic magi as the protagonists, the various resources can all be used to support a saga where the magi are sahirs of the Order of Suleiman detailed in Chapter 3. The default option for this is a group of sahirs using a common bayt al-hikma as the equivalent of a "covenant" and meeting place, although Gifted sahirs may live apart from their fellows in a separate location that forms the equivalent of a chapter house. Baghdad alone has several hundred sahirs who congregate and meet in at least half a dozen buyut*,* although only a few hundred live within the actual city limits*.* The "covenfolk" can include both the mundane and magical servants of the sahirs, as well as associated Middle Eastern hedge magicians visiting or studying at the site, adapting the rules in *Covenants.* As a collective of powerful individual wizards with different magic and personalities, the members of a bayt al-hikma can engage in all the potential activities, challenges, squabbles, and adventures that would be encountered in a conventional Hermetic saga.

As the majority of sahirs lack The Gift and are less interested in laboratory activities, such a saga might involve a greater degree of interaction with the mundane world and more high fantasy, adventurebased story arcs. Opponents and challenges to such a group of non-Hermetic magi could be based around local threats, including the splinter Nizari assassins, devious jinn, the Mongol hordes, or the political machinations of the feuding dynasties of the region. Alternatively, the sahirs may venture further afield into western Mythic Europe and participate in stories where they interact with Hermetic magi, European Faeries, and the Christian church.

See "The Middle East in **Ars Magica**" insert later and Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman for further resources for playing a fully non-Hermetic Saga.

#### **Thus spoke Zarathustra ...**

The descendants of the Zoroastrian priests that once dominated Persian politics and magic are now a scattered handful of wizards in danger of extinction. Zoroastrian magi form a small mystery cult of holy magi within the Order of Hermes and a handful of sahirs still quietly follow the ancient Mazdean faith. Isolated villages of faithful cling to their customs amidst persecution and distrust within the wider medieval Caliphate. A disparate collective of Zoroastrian wizards from different backgrounds and across Mythic Europe may attempt to unite their shattered faith by establishing a community under their combined protective magic (see Chapter



5: Mythic Zoroastrianism for details on non-Hermetic mobed wizards and their faith). Will they establish a new homeland for their people to shelter from the forces of Ahriman or be tempted to establish a base from which to re-carve the former greatness of their pre-Islamic empire?

#### **Holy Knives of Alamut**

The Nizari sect of assassins has one goal in mind: the institution of an Isma'ili state through the elimination of the Shi'a and Sunni rulers. They show remarkable adaptability in the pursuit of this goal, employing whatever tools come to hand: religious zealots willing to die for their masters, their own peculiar brand of magic, diplomacy at the point of a knife, and perhaps even the Order of Hermes. To the Nizaris, the Order of Suleiman is part of the problem and, much as they have helped the Crusaders against the occupying forces of Jerusalem, they might be prepared to help Hermetic magi against their sahir enemies. If this means that the Nizaris first have to convince the Order that it has sahir enemies, the sect is not beyond manufacturing situations to persuade them of this. If the Order still seems reluctant, the Nizaris might attempt to directly coerce individuals by kidnapping and extortion; of course, this might drive the Order towards allying with the sahirs against a Nizari threat. One thing is sure: with the Nizaris involved, blood will be spilled (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia for more details on the medieval Nizari assassins).

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

# *Characters*

Mythic Middle Eastern characters, be they rural or urban in origin, are generated in the same way as other characters but some Virtues and Flaws require renaming or minor alterations. They have access to some additional Virtues and Flaws, as well. Finally, two new Academic Knowledges are also described: Theology: Islam and Islamic Law.

## *Virtues*

#### **Educated (Islamic)**

*Minor, General*

The character has been educated in a mosque or *Qur'an* school. The 50 experience points should be spent on some or all of Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Theology: Islam, Islamic Law and Artes Liberales, due to a different education "system."

## *Flaws*

#### **Dhimmi**

*Minor, General*

The character is a non-Muslim born under Muslim rule. If he is adult and male, he must pay the jizya, and all dhimmis

must abide by certain social restrictions (described earlier), in return for which they receive tolerance and protection from the Muslim authorities. The Judged Unfairly or Outsider flaws are more appropriate for European-born characters who travel through Muslim lands or permanently settle in the Mythic Middle East.

## *New Abilities*

#### **Islamic Law\***

*Academic*

This is the Muslim version of Civil & Canon Law. The major sources of Islamic Law are the *Qur'an* and the *Sunna*. **Specialties:** any one of the sources of Islamic Law, particular topics, customs of a particular area.

#### **Theology: Islam\***

*Academic*

This is the Islamic equivalent of Christian Theology. The major sources for Islamic theology are the *Qur'an* and the *Sunna*. **Specialties:** the *Qur'an*, debates, history, prophets.


## *Chapter Two*

# *History*

And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.

*— The Bible,* Genesis 2:8

In Mythic Europe, scholars trace the origins of humanity to the Middle East and to the final acts of creation undertaken by God, when Adam and Eve were created to tend the Garden of Eden at the junction of the Pison, Gihon, Euphrates, and Hiddekkel (or Tigris) rivers. They ate of the forbidden Tree of Knowledge and were driven from the garden. Worse was to follow, with the casting-down of the Tower of Babel and eventually the Great Flood, which destroyed almost all of humanity.

# *The Ancient Empires*

In the wake of the flood, the earth was repopulated, and the Middle East became home to a series of empires that dominated the region. At its center, on the crescent of land known as Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the ancient peoples developed the earliest form of writing, and there appeared city-states that traded or warred with one another as the inclination suited them. Dynasties of rulers rose and fell, including various Babylonian and Assyrian kings, some of whom ruled empires that stretched as far west as the Holy Land and Syria. Meanwhile, the lands to the east of Mesopotamia were home to a variety of peoples living either as nomads or in urban centers.

The ancient Mesopotamians were pagans, worshiping a variety of deities, most of whom were powerful faerie creatures that demanded worship from mortals. These pagan practices were to be their downfall, however. In 539 BC, the Babylonian king Belshazzar provoked the ire of God by drinking from the sacred vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, which had been taken by his forefather Nebuchadnezzar when he led the Jews of the Holy Land into captivity. Three days after this act, his empire was overthrown by the armies of Cyrus the Great, who had united the Persians and adopted Zoroastrianism, becoming an instrument of the Lord's wrath in the face of this profanation.

Cyrus and his successors ruled the Middle East until the late fourth century BC, when they were overthrown by the Greeks under Alexander the Great. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, the Middle East came under the control of one of his generals, who founded the Seleucid dynasty that ruled in the region until its conquest by the Romans from the west and the Persian Parthians from the east in the second century BC. Thereafter, the Middle East became divided between the Romans and, later, the Byzantines, on the one side, against whom stood the Persian dynasties of the Parthians and their successors, the Sassanids, on the other. The situation remained thus until the seventh century AD, when a new force entered the scene.

# *The Rise of Islam*

Read: In the name of thy Lord Who createth, Createth man from a clot.

Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous, Who teacheth by the pen,

Teacheth man that which he knew not.

 *— The Qur'an* 96: 1-5

In 610, an Arab merchant named Muhammad began to receive the divine revelation. However, his message was not well received by the authorities of his home city of Mecca, which was a major trading center that included a major pagan shrine, the Ka'ba (KA'-ba), which brought in pilgrims and trade from all over Arabia. He

## *The Sacred Vessels*

What became of the sacred vessels from the temple after Belshazzar's feast? Cyrus restored the Jewish community in the Holy Land, and undoubtedly many of the Temple treasures were also taken back there. However, the profanation of the vessels could have rendered them unusable in the eyes of the Jewish priests. In this case, they may have been left behind, somewhere in the Middle East, where they still remain. Perhaps the profanation has transformed them into Infernal objects, which even now are being passed from one owner to the next, bringing ruin upon each. Or perhaps the priests were mistaken, and they are in fact holy relics that may bring great benefits to those who are judged worthy enough to find their resting place in the ruins of Babylon.

and his followers were forced to emigrate to Medina in 622, from which he fought and defeated the Meccans in a war lasting eight years. In 630 Mecca submitted to Muhammad's authority, and he confirmed the Ka'ba's importance to Islam as a shrine originally constructed by the angels, then rebuilt by Adam and later by Abraham with the help of his son Ishmael, the ancestor of the Arabs. Meanwhile, Islam was spreading across the Arabian Peninsula, and by Muhammad's death in 632 most of the inhabitants of the region were Muslims.

# *The Caliphates*

Muhammad was succeeded as leader of the Muslim community by a sequence of rulers known as *khalifas* (kha-LEE-faz), or caliphs, "successors to the Prophet" who were both the religious and secular leaders of the Muslim state, though none claimed to be prophets themselves. The first four caliphs were chosen by general consensus of the community, but the last of these, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (r. 656-661), spent his entire reign fighting against enemies within the Muslim community, eventually losing his life to a political opponent with a poisoned blade. He was succeeded as caliph by the leader of his enemies, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (r. 661-680), who set up a dynastic caliphate, known as the Umayyad (um-MYyad) caliphate, with its capital at Damascus.

The Umayyads ruled from Damascus for nearly a century, and during this period the Muslim world expanded through a mixture of force and diplomacy to its greatest extent, stretching from North Africa and Spain in the west to the borderlands of Central Asia and India in the east. The Umayyads also set up many of the administrative, cultural, and social structures of the Muslim world. Arabic became the language of the administration, a uniform coinage was established, and scholars began to debate issues of law and theology.

However, the Umayyads were not unopposed. The supporters of 'Ali continued to assert the claims of his descendants to the caliphate, through 'Ali's bloodline as cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. They gradually divided into a number of groups collectively known as the Shi'a ((SHEE-'ah), sing/adj. Shi'i), a process that would continue in the centuries that followed (for more on Shi'ism, see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 112-113). A number of these Shi'i groups were sources of rebellions against the Umayyads, and the latter also faced opposition from others who felt that they were impious and illegitimate rulers. The culmination of this opposition came in 750, when the Umayyads were displaced by a family descended from an uncle of the Prophet, known as the 'Abbasids (('ab-BEH-sidz), r. 750-the present).

The 'Abbasids built a new capital in Iraq, called Baghdad, which became a prosperous center of a flourishing Muslim world. This was the golden age of the Islamic world, when great advances began to be made in science, literature, and theology, while the caliphs sent embassies to the corners of the world. It was the time of caliphs such as the legendary Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809), who periodically ventured out by night into the streets of Baghdad in disguise to mingle with his subjects, rewarding the good and punishing the bad, and is also known for having exchanged embassies with Charlemagne himself. In the meantime, increasing numbers of the caliph's subjects were converting to Islam, though it would take another three or four hundred years before Muslims would form the overall majority in their lands.

The golden age could not last, and from the mid-ninth century 'Abbasid power began to decline. The caliphs faced increasing rebellions by Shi'a and others,



## *Story Seed: The Mongol Threat*

The large-scale death and destruction in Transoxiana may cause mystical ripples throughout Mythic Europe that reach various magi of the Order of Hermes. Like the rumored Order of Odin in the north, information on the nomads is conflicting and incomplete. The Primus of Ex Miscellanea is troubled by strange dreams. Dire prophecies are uttered by the seers, astrologers and other diviners across various Houses. The Tremere learn secondhand through their network of this potential threat to the Order and mobilize their intelligence network and resources. The Tenens of the East is greatly troubled by the chaos emerging from beyond the Levant. Even the normally aloof Merinita report an increased turbulence in Arcadia and the discovery of new lands and stories emerging within the Faerie realm. A strange apparition appears during the Great Tribunal at Durenmar despite the usual mystical defenses prepared for such a momentous meeting.

Details on the Mongol devastation of the eastern Islamic lands and rules for Mongol shamans are given in the sidebars of Chapter 9: On the Silk Road.

## *Story Seed: Disputes over the Caliphate*

When the 'Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads, they attempted to wipe out as many members of the family as possible. They missed at least one who went on to found a new ruling dynasty in Spain. It may be that they missed others, and their descendants may approach the characters seeking aid in gaining the caliphal throne. Likewise, the characters could be approached by Shi'i claimants to the caliphate for the same reason. Some of these claimants may have inherited holy relics or other powerful supernatural items from their forbearers, which may tempt the characters to help them, or they may have supernatural powers that make their "requests" difficult to refuse.

financial problems, and greater difficulty in controlling their subordinates. Over the next hundred years, the Muslim world fragmented, with the various provinces becoming largely autonomous states that coexisted or warred with one another as suited their ambitions. In 945 the caliphs came firmly under the control of their immediate deputies, a situation that remained broadly the same until the midtwelfth century. The Seljuk Turks, lead by Togrul Beg, invaded from the Great Steppe in 1037, and had gained control of the Mythic Middle East by the mid-11th century, relegating the caliph to a figurehead while the Seljuk Turks commanded the 'Abbasid armies and provinces. By 1157 the caliph had regained enough power to drive the Seljuk sultan out of Baghdad, and an uneasy truce between the religious and secular rulers was instituted that remains to this day.

The decline in fortunes of the Seljuks was accelerated by the rebellion of the Shansabani in 1149, and the uprising of the Ghuzz in 1151 in Persia's eastern provinces. Ala ad-Din Tekish, the leader of Khwarazm province, capitalized on the collapse of the Seljuk Empire after the death of Sultan Ahmed Sanjar, and eventually defeated his successor Togrul III in 1194. His son Ala ad-Din Mohammed defeated the Shansabani in 1206, and is now the ruler of a vast empire that stretches from the River Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf. While he has declared himself *shah* (Parsi "king"), the caliph in Baghdad has yet to recognize this claim.

The current caliph, al-Nasir (r. 1180- 1225), is a vigorous ruler, but his realm is much reduced, encompassing in reality little more than Iraq, though his rule is nominally recognized by most of the Sunni (SUN-nee) Muslim provincial rulers.

# *The Mongol Invasion*

If your saga follows the course of history, by the end of the reign of al-Nasir the eastern Muslim world has already been attacked by the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan (r. 1206-1227), who have occupied the region east of the Jaxartes River. By Genghis Khan's death they have occupied territory as far west as eastern Persia. Subsequently they take western Persia, Georgia, Armenia, northern Iraq, and Asia Minor. In 1258 they take Baghdad, where they roll the caliph up in a carpet and trample him to death, following a Mongol custom that forbids the shedding of royal blood onto the ground. They are only turned back in 1260, when their advance is checked in Syria by a Mamluk army from Egypt.

## *Chapter Three*

# *Order of Suleiman*

Throughout the years since the founding of the Order of Hermes, magi have spoken of the danger that Arabian wizards present, calling them "The Order of Suleiman" and whispering how they seek to bring about the ruin of Hermetic magi. Some speculate that these stories were started by followers of Flambeau the Founder, or perhaps by others opposed to the introduction of similar wizards in Iberia and elsewhere in Europe into House Ex Miscellanea. In any case, the idea that an organized group of Middle Eastern sorcerers exists and plots against them is very common among magi.

They are right.

Of course, this "Order of Suleiman" is not exactly what magi fear it is, though it does pose a grave threat to those who they consider their enemies. It is composed of **sahirs**, usually unGifted Muslim summoners who wield magic spells and devices similar to their Hermetic counterparts, and who command jinn or other spirits in battle. Their animosity toward the Order of Hermes is fairly recent, as for most of their existence they have been an introverted group, generally devoted to the growth of Islamic culture. Since the start of the Crusades, however, these powerful sorcerers have become more dangerous, and have turned their eyes upon Europe.

Sahirs are designed primarily as adversaries for magi exploring the Mythic Middle East, though it is also possible to play them as player characters in a saga with a Middle Eastern focus.

# *History*

13th-century sahirs believe their powers originated in the marvels wielded by Solomon (Suleiman), King of Israel, prophet, and builder of the first temple in Jerusalem. It is said he commanded hosts of jinn and other spirits, could speak with animals and the elements, and possessed magical devices that focused his power over the supernatural world. Among sahirs, tradition holds that the great king learned many of these secrets from a mysterious sage known as Al-Khidr ("The Green Man"), a legendary figure who, according to the *Qur'an,* taught Moses, traveled with Alexander the Great, and attained immortality by drinking from the Water of Life.

In the years after Solomon many claimed to possess his powers, and some could indeed summon up spirits and speak with beasts as he was said to have done. The Art of Solomon did not die out but, as the years passed, groups of sorcerers began to practice dark and corrupted versions of his power — some say this Infernal version was initially spread by a pair of angels named Harut and Marut tasked with this as a test of mankind's faith — that allowed sorcerers to summon and enslave spirits to their will. Other traditions developed educated and more refined forms of summoning that allowed them to command the elements, animals, and nature as Solomon was said to have done. In Persia especially, this latter version of the Art flourished under the influence of Zoroastrian priests, who perceived its practice as learned and wise.

The birth of Islam changed the Mythic Middle East dramatically. Some sahirs believe that the great caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib, friend and son-in-law of Mohammed, also received guidance from Al-Khidr. He was said to be friendly to magicians and knowledgeable about the natural sciences associated with the Art of Solomon. Some tales describe three wise men who served him, travelers from far-off lands whom he met on pilgrimage, and who joined his court when he became caliph, sworn to support his rule and devout in their adherence to the teachings of the Prophet. Many of the followers of Solomon tell variations on this tale to justify their belief that there is nothing sinful or worldly about the practice of magic. As Ali trusted his advisers, so too may his holy successors trust the wise magicians that succeeded them.

## *The Umayyad Summoners*

Some years later, during the Umayyad dynasty, another trio of summoners swore lifelong service to the caliph; many hold that the legend of Ali's magical advisers derives from this event instead. They were each given an official title, *wazir* ("vizier"), which at that time meant "bearer of magic in service to the caliph." At first they were trusted no more than any other men under his command, and possibly less so by those who fought beside them. As the caliphate began to expand its influence into Persia, Africa, and Europe, however, the warriors began to encounter other magicians — wizards who could rain fire upon the armies of Islam, or cause the seas to rise up and drown them, or cause the men to forget everything they were doing and suddenly the wazirs became especially valuable, for the spirits they summoned could resist this magic. The foreign wizards served the armies that opposed the caliph, and so it became essential for the caliph's wizards to train others who could assist them in the same way.

Soon the three wazirs became thirty wazirs, as they sought out and trained promising students in their Art, and those



thirty became more than a hundred. Their powers developed further as Islam spread, so that, in addition to the spirits of the fallen, they learned to summon and control other spirits such as jinn (see Chapter 4: *The* Jinn), and led waves of them into battle. With their help, the Umayyad caliphs were able to overcome the other wizards who opposed them and ensure the safety of their troops. Meanwhile, the Umayyad armies conquered their foes, and the caliphs came to rule an enormous empire, including all of the Middle East and Persia, Northern Africa, Iberia, and even parts of France. It is most likely stories of these summoners, from before the time of the Founding, that magi and other European wizards equate with the members of the "Order of Suleiman."

The downfall of the wazirs came from their callous dealings with the beings they summoned. Their powers essentially allowed them to enslave the jinn who served them, even though many of these beings also followed the teaching of the Prophet, which forbids such treatment. These practices tainted and ultimately undid their holy war, and turned many denizens of the supernatural realms against them. By about 720 AD the wazirs became desperately preoccupied defending against attacks from within their homelands, fighting a magical war waged upon them from other worlds. This prevented them from lending their support to the invading armies, and was one of the leading factors that slowed and eventually halted the expansion.

The caliphs were furious at this turn of

events, but they did not blame their wazirs; instead, they blamed their people. Some of the Umayyads' opponents took these attacks as indications that the nation of Islam was not rightly guided, and that the Umayyads were not true caliphs. A few even began to declare rival caliphs. To make matters worse, when wrathful spirits abused by the wazirs attacked, they focused upon the summoners themselves, not the common people, forcing the caliphate to defend them. For example, in 746, while Abbasid opponents of the Umayyads were mobilizing their forces in Khurasan, it is said that more than a hundred jinn laid siege to Damascus, demanding that the city turn over two wazirs who they knew hid within. After many such retributive acts, the population of summoners in the Mythic Middle East was dramatically reduced, and the term wazir ceased to be associated with wizards. Their ruthless tradition of summoning mostly died out everywhere but on the fringes of the empire.

## *The Formation of the Suhhar*

As a result of these and other events, the Umayyad caliphate broke apart, and a new line was established in the Abbasids, with their new political center in Baghdad. One of the greatest Abbasid leaders was Harun al-Rashid, who came to power in 786. His mother, named Al-Khayzuran, was originally from Yemen and skilled in the magic of enchanting music and stories. At her urging, the new caliph agreed to assemble a council of wizards to advise him on mystical matters and help him secure his rule. He was convinced that having magical viziers devoted to the empire was a necessary thing, though he preferred to recruit great thinkers over great warriors.

The head of this council was his grand vizier, Yahya ibn Khalid, also known as Yahya the Barmakid, an unGifted scholar who had dabbled in magical potions and elixirs in the court of the previous caliph, and who served as tutor to Harun al-Rashid from a young age. On the new caliph's behalf he wrote to invite the finest minds in Islam to join this "Solomonic" council, explaining Harun's vision of a


magical brotherhood that would make his caliphate paramount in learning and culture. This dream was realized by five great men, who with Yahya and Al-Khayzuran formed the original "wise council" of Harun. These famous sahirs were:

- **• Jabir ibn Hayyan**, an alchemist, summoner, and scholar blessed with The Gentle Gift and a voracious thirst for knowledge. He was a master of the art called Sihr, first learning at the feet of one of the few surviving Umayyad summoners, and later studying everything the others knew. He was responsible for the discovery that allowed the First Council to incorporate their different styles of magic into a single tradition.
- **• Muhammad al-Fazari**, philosopher and astrologer, collector and author of many magical tomes. He constructed the first armillary sphere to aid him in his seasonal calculations. His father Ibrahim is said to have transformed himself into a spirit to watch over and assist his son with his magic and, as al-Fazari's guardian spirit, Ibrahim first showed al-Fazari how to initiate himself and the other unGifted sahirs into their magical secrets.
- **• Bakhtyshu**, a Persian physician and Nestorian Christian. His father, Jurjis ibn Bakhtyshu, had served the previous caliph, but being non-Muslim the son was invited to join the council only provisionally and at Yahya's insistence. He later proved his worth by exorcising a powerful *shaitan* ("demon") that plagued the caliph. It is said he knew the True Names of hundreds of spirits, and taught many of them to the First Council.
- **• Al-Zill Habib**, "the beloved shadow," a popular and inspirational highwayman who led revolts against the Umayyads and earned the unswerving respect of many followers, including a loyal band of jinn and several yatus (faerie wizards from Persia, see Chapter 8). He was believed to be a relative of Al-Khayzuran, and constantly remained cloaked and covered to hide his face, even when alone.
- **• Al-Hajjaj** (or Al-Majnun, "the madman," as he was sometimes called), a

poet and mathematician who wrote of his strange visions. He claimed to have studied from Al-Khidr, and to have traveled into the Magic Realm to drink from the Water of Life. He appeared perpetually as a young man of about 25, and no one could ever determine exactly when he was born.

Together, these seven wise people developed a common language among their different styles of summoning-based magic, and invented the five Solomonic arts (see Solomonic Magic, later). They answered directly to the caliph, and as part of their duties each of them spent time instructing the others or assisting with their magic to ensure that they all knew as much as possible about their different powers. Each of them excelled at a particular aspect of the Art of Solomon, but they combined these specialties so well that their tradition became a unified system, rather than several different abilities.

Al-Khayzuran died suddenly in 789 under very mysterious circumstances. After complaining of a headache, she collapsed in her sitting room and was escorted, apparently unconscious, back to her chambers. There, under the watchful eyes of her son and many of his advisers, her body and possessions simply vanished. Her passing was mourned by the caliph and the entire council. Soon afterward, Yahya retired from court to devote himself more fully to his studies, and his Gifted son Ja'far became Harun's grand vizier and head of the council. Harun moved his palace further north, putting more distance between his court and the sahirs, and from then on Ja'far was the only point of contact between the wizard council and the caliph.

As Harun's reputation increased, the stories tell that he became more introverted and mistrustful of Ja'far and the sahirs he represented. He sought out the advice of other so-called wise men, including a young Hermetic magus sent (supposedly) by the court of Charlemagne called Christopher Coronus, a famous Sufi teacher and holy man named Fozail-e Iyaz, and a strange miracle-worker and representative from the far east who they called Dawud al-Kharita. Under their influence, it is said, Harun began to resent the independence and power wielded by the grand vizier and his family. He ceased consulting with Ja'far in private, but often did so with his new counselors.

Vicious rumors began to spread about Ja'far: that he was a wicked sorcerer who consorted with evil spirits, and that he craved the caliph's seat for himself. Ja'far begged Harun's sister, whom he loved, to speak with her brother on his behalf, in the hope that her voice would soften his heart — but when she did, the easterner Dawud accused Ja'far of beguiling the lady with his magic, and as punishment the caliph had Ja'far executed and the rest of his family imprisoned or killed.

Another version of these events is less sympathetic to Ja'far: as one of the first students of the new Art of Solomon, Ja'far was incredibly skilled and powerful, but too ambitious to be worthy of the title of grand vizier. He was not happy merely advising the caliph, and tried to force Harun to adopt him as his heir. The caliph proved surprisingly resistant to Ja'far's enchantments, and so the crafty sahir took control of the caliph's sister instead, plotting to gain his seat by marriage. Yahya suspected his son, but did not realize how far he would go, and it was only because of the fortuitous intervention of Harun's other advisers that Ja'far's designs were foiled.

Because of this sudden turn of events, the five remaining leaders of Solomonic magic became very frightened, and unsure of what to do. It seemed their council ties to court and caliph had been severed. Months passed and there was no word of a new grand vizier being appointed, and they worried that their alliance would fall apart, their great achievements lost. They decided to travel in secret to the prison where Yahya (who had been mercifully spared by the caliph) was held captive, and met with him to discuss how they could keep the wise council from collapsing.

At Yahya's urging, they decided that they must form their own organization, one independent of the caliph. They realized how dangerously vulnerable to court intrigue and political maneuvering they were as a group of wizards who served Harun and the court directly, and instead chose to divorce themselves from magical service to the worldly authority, and become a self-governing and somewhat informal alliance of sahirs. They called this the *Suhhar Sulayman* ("Summoners of Solo-


mon"), and over the course of several seasons they developed a plan for how they could function and ultimately prosper. (See Organization, later in this chapter.)

When they had finished their founding document, the former viziers humbly presented it to Harun, and begged him for his permission. Once he was convinced that they were not plotting against him, the caliph gave this independent council his blessing, provided that the sahirs who belonged to it continued to serve him as


Many sahirs have attempted to learn what became of the members of the First Council, for completeness or inspiration. Most of what survives them is stories and legends.

#### **Al-Khayzuran**

Al-Khayzuran died, but her memory haunted the building that had once been Harun's palace. A strong feminine presence is often recognized by sahirs sensitive to spirits in her chamber, and many claim to have been visited by her in dreams. Some speculate that the many tales about her brought a powerful faerie to live in her place, a queen who visits sleeping travelers and grants them power in exchange for stories.

#### **Yahya ibn Khalid**

Yahya the Barmakid was forever disgraced by his son's actions at court, though he lived long enough to see the foundation of the Suhhar. It is said he had a collection of permanent Arcane Connections to the other members of the First Council, though no one knows what became of it when he died. It may have been on his person and buried with him in Baghdad, or he may have hidden it in his house or even his cell. The prison still stands in the city, though it has long since been abandoned and has an evil reputation.

#### **Jabir ibn Hayyan**

Jabir went to Kufa, where he wrote many books on the Solomonic arts. He was said to have become friends with Christopher Coronus, magus and ambassador from the Order of Hermes and the court of Charlemagne, though few details about him survive. Christopher corresponded extensively with Tremere the Founder, he was especially interested in using magic to produce visual art, and he once threatened to slay Jabir in a duel but later said this had been a misunderstanding. It is probable from their conversations that early magi and sahirs heard the first accounts of each others' organizations. Legends say that Jabir had a crisis of faith later in life, and that he sacrificed all of his magic just before he died for the right to walk in paradise. This story is controversial, as it suggests that Jabir believed he could not both be a faithful Muslim and practice magic, an idea that has been hotly debated among sahirs ever since.

#### **Muhammad al-Fazari**

Muhammad stayed on as the court astrologer for the rest of his life, and also wrote several exceptional books concerning his fields of expertise. He is said to have drawn a series of prophetic pictures before he died that predicted many future events, including the separation of the Iberian sahirs and Baghdad's invasion by Mongols. He had no children, though he taught many followers, including the great Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, who is generally regarded as one of the most talented astrologers that the Suhhar has ever produced. While many believe that al-Fazari did not die and instead transformed himself into a spirit like his father, no one has yet demonstrated publicly that they are able to summon him.

#### **Bakhtyshu**

Bakhtyshu was the caliph's personal physician, and also helped his son Jabril ibn Bakhtyshu establish himself with the court, setting him up as Ja'far's assistant. Jabril weathered the fall of the Barmakids from the caliph's grace (some say by betraying his master's plans to his enemies), but the stories also tell that Jabril ensured the other members of the First Council were praised and admired by the caliph, perhaps saving them from intrigues that would otherwise have doomed the Suhhar. Jabril had a large family and many children, and his descendants carried the magic of Solomon to the famous House of Healing in Gundeshapur. Some have even suggested that one of Jabril's sons returned with Dawud al-Kharita to the far east, and there established a line of Christian magician-kings who would eventually produce the legendary figure known as Prester John.

#### **Al-Zill Habib and Al-Hajjaj**

Both Al-Zill and Al-Hajjaj remained in Baghdad for many years of teaching, but sometime in the mid-800s they suddenly left without warning, instructing their followers not to come after them. This came just after a visit from one of the caliph's advisers, the Sufi mystic Fozail-e Iyaz, and sahirs have often wondered what passed between them, and if their departure was due to his interference. It was said the two sahirs traveled the length of the entire world together, from the Pillars of Hercules to the mountains of the Far East, and there are many stories of those who came upon them and shared a meal with them, always a young man dressed all in white and his companion hooded and wrapped in black. It is even said that the two of them still live, and that they appear no different in the year 1220 than they must have looked four hundred years ago.


loyal subjects. Several of the first council members retained positions at court; perhaps this is why they continued to call themselves "viziers," and their leader the "grand vizier," at their meetings.

## *A Golden Age*

In the years that followed, the Suhhar Sulayman flourished, teaching many students the secrets of Solomonic magic and welcoming other summoners into their fold. The house in Baghdad where the former council had studied and taught magic grew into a grand academy of Solomonic learning, called Bayt al-Hikma, and old and new sahirs joined them there and began to share their knowledge. A golden age of magic was born, and sahirs trained in the Art of Solomon began to spread across Muslim lands, bringing their magic to every corner of the empire. The Suhhar's separation from the caliph's court ensured that when the caliphate began to fracture, the Suhhar itself remained strong. Large communities of sahirs were organized around houses for teaching and studying magic in Damascus, Gundeshapur, Cairo, and Cordoba, and every year the viziers from those communities would travel to a grand gathering to represent their people.

So many sahirs lived in these great cities that one vizier could not adequately represent them; Cairo, for example, sent 12 viziers to the gathering of 868, one for each house where more than two sahirs lived. In an important decision of 889, the grand vizier declared that the viziers elected by each community also represented the sahirs who lived alone or in pairs closest to them, and that it was the responsibility of the viziers to seek out their more solitary brethren and speak with them before every gathering as part of their service to the Suhhar. Before then, most viziers had simply avoided those members of the Suhhar who chose to live far from civilization, many of whom had The Gift and were thus especially unpleasant to visit.

Cities were the primary centers of magical growth and learning for sahirs, as the lands of Africa and central Arabia and the borders of Islam remained very dangerous for summoners. Groups of supernatural beings still angry at the treatment they received from the Umayyads prowled the edges of their settlements and vindictively struck at any victims they could catch. Those sahirs willing to live in magical auras outside of the Dominion had to be prepared to summon powerful guardians to protect themselves, or create great magical wards against such spirits that would keep them safe, and so generally did not set up in such places permanently.

Perhaps they became fearful of the long journey across such hostile lands, but the Iberian sahirs began hosting their own gatherings in Cordoba in 912. The Baghdad sahirs tried to reconcile with them for several years, sending emissaries to dissuade them, but by 919 they abandoned these attempts and expelled them from the Suhhar Sulayman. Their Iberian council continued to meet on its own until 925 when the majority decided to join the Order of Hermes. There has been little contact between the two groups since then.

Also during the mid-900s, the rise of the Fatimid caliphate drove many sahirs out of Northern Africa and east into Egypt, as rumor spread that the caliphs fought with the aid of strange Berber wizards that the sahirs' spirits could not defeat. The sahirs who had preferred to live on the frontier either fled back to more populated lands or disappeared and were never heard from again. Combined with the defection of the Iberian sahirs, this reduced the lands occupied and represented by the Suhhar Sulayman to just Egypt, Arabia, and Persia.

The Suhhar during this period was powerful, though introspective, and continued to develop so that by the middle of the 11th century, it had become the advanced magical tradition it is in 1220. For the most part, expansionist ideals had been subdued and deprecated among the members of the Suhhar, and most sahirs simply wanted to study their magic in peace.

This peaceful time was interrupted when a prominent sahir named Hasan-i Sabbah murdered the grand vizier. This assassin belonged to a ruthless religious sect called the Nizari Isma'ili, and managed to escape punishment for his crime by fleeing to a Persian mountain stronghold. There, Hasan proceeded to teach others of his faith the secrets of Solomon's Art and essentially created a rival organization of sahirs that has continued to harass and trouble the Suhhar ever since (see The Nizari Isma'ili State, Chapter 8, for more about their history and practices).

There was some occasional contact with other magical traditions during this time — since the First Council, sahirs had been aware of the European organization of wizards who called themselves the Order of Hermes, and after the Cordoba sahirs joined this organization there were many who sought to know even more about them, particularly how their magic differed from that of the Suhhar. They also knew about a few Zoroastrian priests still living in Persia, a few of whom had become sahirs, though relations between them were always strained. On the other hand, after driving most of the sahirs out of Northern Africa, the Berber wizards did not encroach further into the Middle East.

By the end of the 11th century, the sahirs had turned completely upon themselves, their focus entirely inward, and the magical Middle East had become like a city in a bottle.

## *The Crusading Suhhar*

The situation changed entirely with the Crusades.

When foreign knights laid siege to Antioch and Jerusalem, the Muslim sahirs were surprised, shocked, and enraged. A few acted to help prevent Tyre's fall, but for the most part the Suhhar was wildly unprepared for the attack. They then overreacted by electing to take a firmer hand over the supernatural politics of the region. They sent representatives to meet with and spy on the European wizards who had come over, and were surprised to learn that most of them were immune to their Solomonic magic, much in the same way that spirits, caliphs, and holy men had always been able to resist them. Others attacked the invaders, fighting with the Muslim armies against the magi, but those sahirs who met magi directly in battle were quickly defeated, and many of them were slain.

The reluctant verdict among the majority of surviving sahirs was that the invaders fought with the Divine on their side, that



## *The Families of Solomon's Seal*

The five great families of Solomonic sahirs descend from the five members of the First Council who formed the Suhhar Sulayman, some by blood but most by association. Each has become specialized in one type of magic, and tends to come from a particular region.

#### **Ashab al-Sakhr "Followers of the Stone"**

*Ashab al-Sakhr* (ass-HAWB us-SAKHR) is a family of specialists in Solomonic Alchemy who descend from Jabir ibn Hayyan, the only Gifted member of the First Council. They are affiliated with the city of Damascus, the former capital city of the Umayyad wazirs and now the center of the sahirs' counter-Crusade against the invading magi and soldiers. Besides being very unfriendly to Europeans, it is common for Followers of the Stone to be especially pious, and non-Muslims are almost unheard of among them. It is perhaps the most "noble" sahir family; its members value personal honor very highly, and especially favor arms and armor. Many of them choose to fight with steel instead of magic — or with steel augmented with magic.

#### **Ashab al-Najm "Followers of the Star"**

In the early days of the Suhhar, Solomonic Astrology was especially favored by a small group of Zoroastrians who converted to Islam and came to Baghdad to study magic from Al-Khwarizmi, the famous student of Al-Fazari. They later established a small academy in Nasibin in the north, and other houses entirely devoted to their art in many Persian cities as well. *Ashab al-Najm* (ass-HAWB un-NAJM) is perhaps the most widespread family of sahirs, and also the most arcane; they tend to dress and look like wizards or, at the very least, wise scholars. A common belief in the family is that it is important for them to encourage the majestic reputation of magicians, even while using magic to serve others, lest the people cease to value it.

#### **Ashab al-Yad "Followers of the Hand"**

The first sahirs who specialized in Solomonic Physic were all members of the Bakhtyshu family, and took their magic with them to Gundeshapur, in Persia. There they established a famous academy known as the House of Healing. Most of the first physician sahirs were Nestorian Christians, though Muslims, Jews, and pagans have also joined their family, and their reputation has always been somewhat poor because of their ready acceptance of outsiders. This means the *Ashab al-Yad* (ass-HAWB ul-YAD) family is seen to have something of a sinister aspect within the Suhhar they are perceived as sahirs who heal but who also harm — and so no one is ever quite sure exactly how a Follower of the Hand will respond to a given situation.

#### **Ashab al-Qalb "Followers of the Heart"**

Though the *Ashab al-Qalb* (ass-HAWB ul-QALB) family was technically established by Al-Zill Habib, his followers generally regard Al-Khayzuran as the family's matriarch and role model, especially since so little is known about the "beloved shadow" who taught them. Since Al-Zill disappeared, the civic focus of Solomonic Storytelling has remained in Baghdad, still known as the city of a thousand tales, and the grand vizier elected to lead the Suhhar has most often been a Follower of the Heart. They are usually very political sahirs, interacting with supernatural creatures like faeries and magical beings more often than other sahirs, and only rarely have The Gift. Women are much more common in this family; the sahira-to-sahir ratio is almost one-to-one.

#### **Ashab al-Nahr "Followers of the River"**

Solomonic Travel was often marginalized as a lesser art by early sahirs, as few of them understood the power of other realms and worlds: not just Faerie and the Magic Realm, but also places of Divine and Infernal power, and even the realms of dreams and death. Two generations after Al-Hajjaj, a Nabatean traveler named Ibn Wahshiyya deciphered many secrets about these places from the writings of the ancient Egyptians, and singlehandedly revitalized the Art. There is a great academy in Cairo devoted to the study of these mysteries, and it is still considered the locus of the *Ashab al-Nahr* (ass-HAWB ul-NAHR) family's magic. Ibn Wahshiyya and Al-Hajjaj both had reputations for intense passion and, ultimately, madness, and their followers are usually eccentric as well.

#### **Ashab al-Halqa "Followers of the Circle"**

There are also many sahirs who consider themselves specialized in no particular art, or who focus on their summoning art rather than the Solomonic arts. Before they left the Suhhar, many of the sahirs of Cordoba called themselves *Ashab al-Halqa* (ass-HAWB ul-HAL-qa), referring to the outside edge of the pentacle that forms the Seal of Solomon. This term is still used to describe unaligned sahirs, or those who claim to belong to none of the great families. Most Gifted sahirs and self-taught summoners meet these criteria, preferring to remain apart from the yearly gatherings, where they must be represented by viziers from the other families.


Jerusalem was rightfully theirs, and that there was nothing they could do. However, the leader of one of the five great Solomonic families, the Asala al-Sakhr, asserted that the invaders had been aided by Infernal powers. A strong anti-crusader presence developed under his direction, especially among Syrian viziers and those who studied Solomonic Alchemy. The Suhhar remained publicly uninvolved, but many sahirs began acting against the European invaders, signing onto armies to fight them directly or teaching other soldiers to summon and wield Solomonic magic against their foes, much like the Umayyad wazirs.

The Suhhar soon relaxed most of their strictures concerning fair treatment of non-Muslim supernatural beings, and agreed that crusading magi of the Order of Hermes were enemies of the Muslim people, authorizing sahirs to retaliate however they felt was just. In the aftermath of the First Crusade, sahirs acted mostly in secret, uncertain what would happen if they were to confront the Hermetic wizards directly. They taught magic to important leaders, helping them understand how the Art of Solomon could assist their cause; they manipulated real-world events by taking advantage of the geography of the Magic Realm, circumventing the enemy to ambush them from behind or ransack their camps; they interpreted astrological indicators to predict unfavorable circumstances for their enemies, so that they knew precisely when to strike; and generally they confused and harried the opposing armies and leaders wherever possible. Their involvement ensured the recapture of Edessa, and also the downfall of the Second Crusade against the Muslim states.

There is a tradition among the Suhhar whereby an appointed vizier adopts the guise of a nameless old wise man, much as Al-Khidr is described as doing in the *Qu'ran*, and approaches promising Muslim leaders or scholars with an offer to teach them magic or assist their causes in other ways. This is seen as an honorable way for sahirs to involve themselves directly in the politics of the region without committing the Suhhar to their cause, and is often called "sending a guide." When two men rose to prominence in the late 1100s, Nur ad-Din and Saladin, both were sent a guide with an offer of magical aid. Nur


ad-Din had no wish to join the Suhhar, revealing to the ambassador that he had already been taught magic by Al-Khidr himself. In fact, there was a brief exchange of wisdom between the two men, documented in a famous text now kept safely in Baghdad. Saladin refused the guide, no explanation given, and the sahirs of the region were forced to try to aid him without his consent.

In 1220, the Suhhar Sulayman is still at war with the crusaders occupying the Holy Land, including members of the Order of Hermes. They still observe the yearly gathering at Baghdad, but the conflict is rarely discussed. Plans are in motion for a retaliatory attack against the Levant, what might be considered a Solomonic countercrusade, and sahirs have been gathering intelligence about the Order of Hermes so they may strike at them where they are weakest and — they hope — drive the invading magi from their lands entirely.

To this end, the sahirs have made it clear that all Hermetic magi are welcome in their lands, where they can be watched more easily without their knowledge, and where they can be found more quickly when the time comes to attack. They now study their enemy in earnest, for they are still at war and do not intend to lose.

# *Culture*

Most of what defines a sahir of the Suhhar Sulayman was decided by the members of the First Council, codified at the meeting in 805 when they first became an independent organization, and this has been reinforced at the gathering every year since (see Organization, later, for details of how these gatherings function). As they envisioned it, a person must simply appear before the assembly accompanied by a sponsor to join, and need only demonstrate to the assembled sahirs that he can summon a spirit. No other criteria or restrictions were considered necessary, since all of their magic depended on this power more than anything else.

In deference to Al-Khayzuran and


Bakhtyshu, no restrictions against women or non-Muslims were written into the founding document. They required that, in addition to the pious practice of zakat, every sahir must share one-quarter of his wealth with the Suhhar, which would apply these resources towards the spread of knowledge in their communities. Also, because of the many jinn uprisings from the century before, they established rules governing how sahirs could summon and interact with spirits. No thinking, feeling being would be bound in thrall to a sahir, they wrote, or held captive by a sahir who himself remained free; those who did this would no longer be part of the Suhhar. These were the only laws they envisioned the sahirs needing to enforce; all other matters would be decided by Islamic law, to which they were all clearly subject.

In 1220 there are approximately 5,000 members of the Suhhar living in the lands of the Mythic Middle East. They are most numerous in Iraq and Jazira, least common in Transoxania, and while a small community might support only five or six sahirs at most, large cities like Al-Mada'in or Basra can easily support 50, often divided up among different districts. Beyond the boundaries of this book's focus, in Syria or Egypt for example, might be found another two or three thousand sahirs who also belong to the Suhhar and who send representation each year. Of this total, about two-thirds are men, three-quarters are Muslims, and only about 500 have The Gift. In total, sahirs outnumber Hermetic magi by about five to one.

## *Organization*

The Suhhar Sulayman is governed by a consultative council, the *Majlis al-Sulayman* ((MAJ-liss al-SUE-lem-un), "Solomonic Council," pl. *Majalis*). Every community of three or more sahirs living within the borders of Islam chooses one of its number to represent it as a vizier at the Majlis, and this representative travels to Baghdad every summer to speak on behalf of the community. All these assembled viziers then elect one of their own to lead them as grand vizier. Each vizier has one vote in this decision, no matter how many sahirs he represents, but the matter is often easily settled by the volume of cheers as each candidate comes forward, or by a show of hands. A strict count of votes is rarely necessary.

Once elected, the grand vizier addresses all issues that are brought to him, though these are typically issues that are purely internal to the Suhhar. All the Majlis ultimately oversees is membership in the Suhhar, and thus the worst sentence that the grand vizier can pronounce at Majlis is expulsion. In this, the grand vizier has absolute authority for the whole year, though he is also expected to follow precedent and heed the will and advice of his fellow viziers. Most issues that come up between gatherings are deferred until Majlis, since the first thing the new grand vizier must do is ratify any judgments that have been made since the previous year.

The Suhhar has five distinct "families" of sahirs, magical lineages that trace back to five of the members of the First Council. Each family represents one particular branch of the Solomonic art, and the five heads of these families are collectively referred to as the *Asalat* ((a-sa-LEHT), sing. *Asala* (a-sa-LAH)), which means "points" and refers to the five points on the Seal of Solomon. Each family has its own method of choosing their Asala, but they are usually the most powerful followers of their art. All five must be present for the Majlis to be valid; if any of them are missing the family must agree upon another Asala before the grand vizier is chosen.

The five Asalat have the authority to remove the grand vizier, and any of them may call for a private vote at any time if they believe he is unable to guide the Suhhar with wisdom. They can also choose another grand vizier between gatherings, if the previous grand vizier is removed or something happens to him, and this appointment is valid until the next time the Majlis meets. This is a rare event, not least because it requires all five of them to gather and discuss it. For this reason, none of the Asalat may be elected grand vizier, though they each have a vote.

Only viziers are supposed to attend Majlis, though there are three exceptions. Sahirs applying to join the Suhhar may attend in the company of a vizier, servants of a vizier may attend to see to his needs, and spirits that have been summoned by the vizier may enter with him but may not be summoned while inside without special dispensation from the grand vizier. All three sorts of guest are expected to be unobtrusive, and do not vote. Any attention they attract reflects positively or negatively upon the vizier who they accompany, and if they disturb the proceedings the grand vizier typically orders that vizier to leave, taking them with him.

Issues commonly brought to the Majlis include: disputes over rights to contested resources such as vis or spirits; accusations that a sahir is not devoting himself to the spread of knowledge as he has promised to do; initiating new members into the Suhhar*;* declaring former members officially removed from the Suhhar*;* and matters of policy or complaints regarding sahirs' dealings with other wizards or supernatural beings. There are often discussions, such as what should be done in hypothetical situations, or the sharing of knowledge or intelligence regarding what is happening within the borders of Islam.

Established practice at Majlis is for the grand vizier to hear all who wish to speak to each issue, and these speeches usually address how similar matters have been decided previously, or else they are pleas for mercy or special consideration due to unusual circumstances. The standard punishment for every crime is expulsion from the Suhhar, though the grand vizier can always declare a less severe punishment if he feels it is merited — for example, he can lessen a sentence by requiring the offender pay a fine of vis (due by the next Majlis) or perform a service for the Suhhar in lieu of expulsion. Of course, the grand vizier risks upsetting the rule of law and being removed from his position if he demonstrates obvious favoritism.

Since the days of the First Council, most of the decisions of the Majlis have been justice between individuals, and only rarely those that would affect the entire Suhhar. Those few decisions of precedence have mostly governed how representatives speak for the sahirs they represent, and what constitutes a community ("three or more who live together" is the general rule). Other verdicts established the many ways that sahirs may fulfill their obligation to the spread of knowledge. Sahirs must not trouble the Majlis with matters that

can be addressed by the mundane court unless there are supernatural factors that only sahirs would recognize, and then it is usually better that other sahirs speak with the court on their behalf.

The fact that only viziers may attend and speak at the Majlis, and that sahirs are usually not inclined to choose troublemakers as their representatives, means that it is common for a sahir accused at the Majlis to be unable to even attend, much less speak in his own defense. This is accepted as normal, and a sahir's vizier provides such defense as he feels appropriate. Obviously, things often go badly for sahirs on bad terms with their vizier, but this is another reason for using the mundane courts to resolve most problems.

It is not uncommon for two aggrieved parties, or the viziers representing them, to duel rather than rely on the judgment of the grand vizier. There are many kinds of trials acceptable to the Majlis, from boasting contests and competitive storytelling to spirit champions wrestling each other for dominance — even duels to the death using magic, steel, or both. For this to serve justice, both parties must agree to abide by the results of the duel (although if a sahir is obviously more powerful than his challenger, it is considered cowardly not to accept), and the terms must be acceptable to both parties and the grand vizier. Generally, seconds decide the specifics, based on what they know of the competitors, and these events are often seen as a form of entertainment for the assembled viziers.

An important issue settled by the Majlis concerns sahirs who become supernatural beings (who, in mechanical terms, gain a Might Score). In the 10th century, a sahir complained that another had learned to summon him with his magic, and had shared this formula with several of his cohorts, who would all constantly interrupt his studies by summoning him and proposing absurd bargains. The second sahir*,*  who had guessed this was coming and got his companions to elect him their vizier, argued that there was no law forbidding him from practicing the Art on any spirit he could summon. After much discussion, the grand vizier ruled that since the first sahir could be summoned by the second, he was no longer a sahir. As a supernatural being, the (former) sahir was no longer subject to their laws, and could do whatever he wished to the other as recompense for being annoyed by him and his friends. Since then, the Suhhar has treated all spirits and other supernatural creatures as ineligible for membership.

The Suhhar requires that sahirs only give or sell "magic things" that they have made to other sahirs. This was originally agreed to ensure that sahirs did not anger the caliph by supplying magical devices to his enemies, but is now used to help prevent bound spirits and Solomonic magic from being used against the Suhhar, and also to keep rival groups from forming in the Middle East by limiting their access to vis. Offering vis to spirits that sahirs have summoned is perfectly acceptable, but sahirs are not supposed to trade away extracted vis to magi or other wizards in the region (trading naturally-occurring vis is still a gray area, and of course sahirs can buy vis with impunity). Also, sahirs are required to retain control of any magical devices that they make for non-sahirs to use. This restriction includes mundane ob-

## *Majlis Story Seeds*

There are many stories centered around the Majlis al-Sulayman, for sagas focused on sahirs or magi.

#### **A New Grand Vizier**

Kha'trazh appears to be in his fifties, though he has lived almost a hundred years. Many think he is likely to die soon, which will cause great deliberation at the next Majlis as the assembled sahirs try to choose an appropriate replacement. When this happens between gatherings, the Asalat usually choose the vizier who represents the original bayt al-hikma (now called the Dar al-Hikma, see Chapter 7: Mesopotamia, Baghdad) to serve in the interim, but the sahir who currently holds that position is very controversial and unlikely to retain the position after the vote. Campaigning for the position will likely proceed in earnest as soon as Kha'trazh dies.

#### **A Test of Arms**

The Followers of the Stone typically decide their Asala with a test of arms, and a vengeful sahir who opposes Kha'trazh might challenge his family's leader to try to take the position.

#### **The Sixth Asalat**

A group of sahirs who do not belong to the five families insist they receive representation among the Asalat, and demand a sixth Asala. Sahirs who belong to this movement might use a six-pointed star as their symbol.

#### **The Sahir-Magus**

A magus who can summon spirits could easily gain membership in the Suhhar Sulayman, and perhaps speak on behalf of his sodales in the Order of Hermes. This might make Kha'trazh's policy of avoiding immediate conflict with the Order of Hermes unfeasible, and to resolve the situation he might quietly encourage other sahirs to challenge this sahir-magus to a duel.

#### **The Sahirs of Iberia**

An Iberian sahir comes to Majlis, representing a community of sahirs that do not belong to the Order of Hermes. He reminds them that another Crusade threatens the followers of Islam — the Reconquista — and begs them to consider restoring their alliance.

#### **The Vizier's Opposition**

Kha'trazh expels a popular sahir accused of betraying the Suhhar. This is a rallying point for the leader of the grand vizier's opposition, who promises to restore the disgraced sahir if his supporters will vote for him.



## *Majlis in Baghdad*

Every summer, many of the streets and much of the open land on the south side of the Round City in Baghdad (see Chapter 7) fill with stalls and tents in an enormous fair. This is attended by merchants from all over the Mythic Middle East, and lasts most of the season. All manner of goods and services may be found at this event, including unique items and entertainments brought by strange men from fantastic lands. Visitors are cautioned to maintain a clear idea of what they seek before they explore, for there are many vendors who appear only when their wares are especially desired, or who lure unwary travelers into their tents where they disappear forever.

The Suhhar Sulayman meets here every year in a great six-sided hall located at the center of the bazaar and hidden from outsiders with powerful magic, so that it appears as a collection of brightly-colored tents always in the distance. It is usually guarded by several powerful spirits summoned by the Asalat to keep outsiders from intruding. Inside the hall is a series of luxurious tiers several levels deep, outfitted with sumptuous pillows, lamps, fans, and magicallyconjured servants that bring food and drink, all of this beneath a transparent ceiling that shows the sky and the heavens beyond. The six descending steps of comfort where the viziers assemble by family surround a central stage with a gold-inlaid pentacle, where the grand vizier sits on a jeweled throne.

The official dates of the Majlis al-Sulayman are always carefully calculated by the astrologers of the Suhhar to match the dates of the First Council. It is supposed to begin at dusk on the day when the sun passes from the constellation of Leo into the sign of Virgo, and it continues through the following night, typically breaking up before dusk on the third day. (In 1220 AD, this is August 15- 17.) In unusual circumstances the Majlis can continue beyond these dates, but the majority of the viziers will likely depart, their obligation having been fulfilled.

If re-elected, the current grand vizier Kha'trazh holds formal council the first evening and late into the night, and all the next day as well, though he does not expect the other viziers to endure his strict regimen, and does not appear to notice if anyone naps through the proceedings. He usually reserves more controversial matters for the second evening after dinner. Viziers are encouraged to mingle, for once the grand vizier has been elected their official role is done, though Kha'trazh listens patiently to any vizier who wishes to speak. The contemporary Majlis is usually a quiet buzz of many different voices speaking together, surrounding the louder and more formal speeches in the central circle. Another grand vizier might organize the event differently, as others have in the past.

Many sahirs come to this event to trade vis with each other outside in the market. Some types of vis are particularly valuable to them (what magi would identify as Rego vis), and some are not (they generally have little use for Animal and Herbam vis). Magi who come upon the bazaar may be surprised at the number of supernatural curiosities available for barter.

Once the Majlis is over and summer has turned to autumn, the south side of the old city of Baghdad empties and the collection of paths, lots and stalls soon looks like a jumble of ruins again. The local sahirs maintain this illusion of dilapidated abandonment, to prevent passersby from stumbling upon their buildings or other evidence of the yearly gathering. A few of the vendors do remain throughout the year, though they tend to be "in the know" since the district does not have a good reputation with the rest of Baghdad and most of its people look to other markets for their needs.

jects that have been improved with Solomonic magic, like weapons or animals, and has recently been applied to books written about Solomonic magic. Sahirs caught letting enhanced items loose must forfeit whatever payment they received, and are usually tasked by the grand vizier with recovering the enhanced items for the Suhhar in lieu of expulsion.

Another issue that has been settled by precedent is who may participate in the vote for grand vizier, and who settles disputes regarding the outcome. In order to attend the Majlis, every sahir must be vouched for by an Asala, who introduces him to the assembly and names the community he represents. If no Asala will speak for him, he may not enter. If there is a dispute regarding the outcome of the vote, the Asalat settle the matter. Once when there was a tie for grand vizier, the Asalat voted to determine the winner. Another time when the former grand vizier was delayed until past dusk and the assembled viziers had proceeded to choose another grand vizier without him, the Asalat decided to reverse the decision and vote again.

For nearly 30 years, the Majlis has chosen Kha'trazh al-Wazir al-Dall Ariq al-Qalb to lead them, a calm and quiet man from Basra who always chooses his words carefully. He is not considered especially clever or powerful — he does not have The Gift — and he is said to have chosen his laqab name al-Wazir al-Dall ("the dignified vizier") to suggest that he would not abuse his position or give himself airs. His chief virtues are that he is thought to be easily guided by the voices of his assembled viziers, that he listens to everyone who wishes to speak, and that he is on relatively good terms with all five Asalat.

The Majlis has always been a festive occasion, but in the years since the start of the Crusades, the tone of the gathering has become more solemn. Sahirs know that a powerful enemy has invaded, one who can probably infiltrate their gatherings and divine their movements. Thus, they are careful not to wage war overtly, and their plans are not discussed in public. The official word is that the Majlis has no authority over non-Solomonic wizards, and so matters dealing with them are off the table. Those sahirs who have encountered the enemy are usually invited to


meet privately with the grand vizier in a magical fortress on an island hidden deep within the Magic Realm, where such matters can be discussed more openly.

## *How Sahirs Live*

Sahirs are typically organized around buyut al-hikma, which are run by the viziers of the Suhhar. Their primary purpose is teaching the Art of Solomon to other sahirs and initiating promising students into their secrets. Their secondary purpose is educating their community and providing a center for higher learning and culture. Most cities in the Middle East have a bayt al-hikma located somewhere within their walls, and some (like Baghdad or Najaf) have several.

Buyut al-hikma typically have a library (made up of books donated in exchange for access), Solomonic laboratories, and vis stores. They are similar to Hermetic covenants, and can be designed in much the same way. Unlike Hermetic covenants, however, buyut do not typically have an income that can support more than the sahirs who live and work there, since they must also provide service to their community. Buyut are generally welcoming to strangers, since sahirs are, at least in theory, obliged to share their knowledge with anyone who has an interest. Teachers at buyut occasionally find themselves instructing young students alongside master sahirs.

Many sahirs may live within buyut al-hikma, while others merely live nearby and visit them regularly. A few sahirs, especially those with The Gift, live on their own far from large groups of people, and communicate with other sahirs through written messages or other means. Every sahir must maintain ties with his bayt, because it is his only connection to the Suhhar as a whole. If a vizier has been unable to make contact with a sahir for five years, he is considered lost. Others may be sent to try to find him, or may not, depending on the opinion his vizier has of him, but if a lost sahir returns, he may always go to Majlis with his vizier and ask to rejoin.

Like most scholars in the Mythic Middle East, sahirs must support themselves, typically by working two seasons out of every year. If a sahir lives at a bayt al-hikma, these two seasons include the season of service required by the Suhhar. Many sahirs teach, instructing other sahirs or students in the Solomonic arts or other subjects as directed by the community's leaders. Others are scribes, apothecaries, or physicians, though other professions are possible too.

For those sahirs who are uncomfortable working among others, or unable to do so, the donation of one-quarter of their wealth is considered an acceptable substitute for service. Each sahir gives his contribution to his vizier, who uses it to subsidize the bayt or fund special projects requested by the grand vizier.

Most new sahirs learn magic from other sahirs, though a few are discovered with summoning powers and invited to initiate the Solomonic arts with aid from their mentors. When brought before the Majlis and recognized as a new member, a sahir typically takes a new name by which he will be known from then on. This is often a unique collection of sounds that the sahir likes, or perhaps a name taken to honor someone he admires, similar to the Muslim *ism*. He typically adds a *nisba* to the end of his name as well, to represent his Solomonic family: al-Sakhr, al-Najm, al-Yad, al-Qalb, al-Nahr, or very rarely al-Halqa (see The Families of Solomon's Seal). If a sahir is chosen by his community to speak for them, he typically takes another name, a *laqab* that describes how he intends to represent them. This nickname is only used as long as he fulfills this role; if he steps down or his community appoints another, the laqab is dropped.

# *Characters*

This section includes rules for designing sahir characters to play in a saga, either as an unusual character in a Hermetic magi saga, or as a standard character in a saga set in the Mythic Middle East.



## *Sahir Virtues and Flaws*

Some of these Virtues refer to Accelerated Supernatural Abilities. These are like other Supernatural Abilities, but they increase on the same accelerated scale as Hermetic Arts, and are described in more detail under The Solomonic Arts, later in this chapter.

There are many Hermetic Virtues and Flaws that might be appropriate for sahirs to take as Supernatural Virtues or Flaws, as long as they improve or limit Solomonic magic to the same degree. Storyguides are encouraged to adapt these as they see fit.

#### **New and Modified Virtues**

The following Virtues are appropriate to sahir characters.

#### **Invocation of Names of Power**

*Major, Supernatural*

The sahir is capable of casting a unique type of spell called a Name of Power, which is invented like a summoning spell (see Seasonal Summoning, later in this chapter) but grants a bonus to a subsequently cast spell, similar in scope to those found on the Shape and Material Bonus table. The spell level is equal to five times the bonus; some example Names of Power are given in the nearby insert. If the sahir knows a Name of Power that governs the area of another spell he wishes to cast, he may "utter" (cast) the Name of Power first, and the subsequent spell's Casting Total receives a bonus equal to that of the Name of Power. Thus, a Name of Power: Shamash can give a bonus to any formula involving light or justice. A sahir may utter any number of applicable Names of Power before casting a spell, but the total bonus cannot exceed his Finesse score. Names of Power can also be used in conjunction with summoning; the Names invoked must match the type of spirit being summoned. Some examples are:

**Name Type** Adad storms, divination Dumuzi livestock, crops Ishtar healing, love Nergal destruction, disease Ninhursag earth Shamash light, justice

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

*For example, Jasmin knows the Name of Power: Ishtar at Level 20, granting her +4 to healing effects. She utters this formula in the round before a Solomonic Physic formula designed to speed recovery, and receives a +4 bonus to her Casting Total. Jasmin also knows a Level 15 Name of Power: Ninhursag that gives +3 to earth-related effects, and a Level 15 Name of Power: Nergal that gives +3 to destruction-related effects. She wants to summon an earthquake spirit, so takes two rounds to utter both; however, since her Finesse is 5, she receives only +5 to her roll to summon the spirit, rather than +6.*

Botching a Name of Power roll, or a spell affected by a Name of Power, usually attracts the negative attention of the Named being. This Virtue is similar to (and possibly the ancestor of) the Invocation Magic Virtue (*The Mysteries Revised Edition*, page 78).

The yatus (see Persia, Chapter 8) introduced this Virtue into the Suhhar Sulayman, and they usually call upon the names of the ancient Mesopotamian gods (see Mythic Mesopotamia, Chapter 7).

#### **Sahir**

*Free, Social Status*

By demonstrating to the Majlis that he can summon a spirit, the character has been accepted into the Suhhar and is affiliated with a magical academy known as a bayt al-hikma, or "house of wisdom." He is obliged to further the Suhhar's causes for one season every year, but is supported by them and benefits from increased access to its teachers, books, and vis sources. During character creation, the character may take appropriate Academic or Arcane Abilities.

If the character does not actually possess the power to summon a spirit, he should take the Dark Secret Story Flaw, as he will be immediately expelled from the Suhhar when this fact is discovered.

This Virtue should be taken along with another Social Status Virtue or Flaw, to describe the character's status among non-sahirs.

#### **Sihr**

*Major, Supernatural*

This Virtue gives the character an initial score of 0 in the Accelerated Supernatural Ability of (Solomonic) Sihr.

#### **Solomonic Alchemy**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character gains an Accelerated Supernatural Ability, Solomonic Alchemy, with an initial score of 0.

#### **Solomonic Astrology**

*Major, Supernatural*

Taking this Virtue gives the character the Accelerated Supernatural Ability of Solomonic Astrology with an initial score of 0.

#### **Solomonic Physic**

*Major, Supernatural*

Taking this Virtue gives the character the Accelerated Supernatural Ability of Solomonic Physic with an initial score of 0.

#### **Solomonic Storytelling**

*Major, Supernatural*

Taking this Virtue gives the character the Accelerated Supernatural Ability Solomonic Storytelling with an initial score of 0.

#### **Solomonic Travel**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character gains an initial score of 0 in the Accelerated Supernatural Ability of Solomonic Travel.

#### **Vizier**

*Minor, Social Status*

The character has been elected as representative for a community of sahirs. This gives him several political advantages, such as the ability to attend Majlis and speak before the grand vizier, as well as additional responsibilities at his bayt alhikma. The character has a Reputation of level 3 among the Suhhar, which can be positive or negative.

Only characters with the Sahir Virtue may take this Virtue.

#### **Yatu Magic**

*Minor, Supernatural*

The sahir's heritage comes from the yatus of Persia (see Mazandaran, Chapter 8). He is attuned to both Magic and


Faerie auras, and his magical effects can be treated as either Magic or Faerie powers, depending upon which gives him the most favorable (or least unfavorable) aura bonus. He does not gain Warping Points from living in either type of aura.

#### **New and Modified Flaws**

These Flaws are also designed especially for sahir characters.

#### **Bound Spells**

*Major, Supernatural*

All of the sahir's spells are bound to a specific spirit when they are invented, the spirit that was present in the laboratory to power the effect. Unlike other sahirs, the character cannot cast his spells through any spirit he summons, but must use the spirit to which the spell is bound. The sahir may easily reinvent a spell in one season that he has learned to cast with another spirit, since he effectively possesses a lab text for that spell.

#### **Patron**

*Minor or Major, Story*

The character serves an important figure in the Mythic Middle East, such as the caliph, a wealthy emir, an ancient jinni, or a powerful sahir. This person will periodically instruct the character to act on his behalf — the more powerful the patron, the more onerous or frequent the duties that will be required of the character. As a Minor Flaw, the character has the patron's ear, and may influence him and his requests. Also, the patron will generally grant a favor or boon to the character whenever he does something that is asked of him. As a Major Flaw, the character has little choice in the matter and must do whatever his patron asks, or suffer grave consequences. Rewards are not to be expected.

#### **(Realm) Spirit Companion**

*Minor, Story*

The character is accompanied by an intelligent magical spirit companion, one that is smart enough to follow orders, and also to disobey them. The greater the

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

companion's Might Score, the more independent it is. A grog-level spirit (Might Score of about 5 or less) is nearly an extension of the character's will, while a companion-level spirit (Might Score of about 10) will follow instructions but often do what it thinks is best, and a magus-level character (Might Score of 15 or more) is condescending or wild, and rarely acts except on its own initiative.

The spirit may belong to any realm. If it is infernal, this is a Major Story Flaw instead, as the demon regularly attempts to corrupt the sahir. An infernal Spirit Companion in the Mythic Middle East is not as bad as it would be in Mythic Europe, as other sahirs will assume that the sahir has it under control, though they might be more wary in its presence.

## *Sahir Character Creation*

Designing sahirs is slightly different from making magi, as the majority of sahirs do not have The Gift and are more like companions in terms of power. Sahirs do not have an established apprenticeship period, so their seasonal experience gained during character creation is streamlined, and since sahirs manage their own

## *Other Summoning Arts*

There are four summoning powers published in other **Ars Magica** supplements that may be used with Solomonic magic, since all can target spirits and originate from the Art of Solomon. These are listed in order of rarity in the Middle East, from most to least, with their variations are summarized as follows. To help distinguish them, different versions of Summoning often have a parenthetical in front of the name, suggesting their particular focus.

#### **(Spirit) Summoning**

This Art summons any incorporeal spirit, generally one associated with the same realm as this Art, though Infernal spirits are also common. If the summoning is successful, the spirit is bound until released by the summoner. (Spirit) Summoning is always tainted with the Infernal, and thus Infernal versions are most common, but there are also Faerie and Magic versions. (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 114-115)

# **(Theurgical) Summoning, or (Elemental) Summoning**

Some of this magical tradition's followers summon spirits associated with the elemental forms (Aquam, Auram, Ignem, or Terram). The spirit can come from any realm, and is typically held within a container until released. The power is most commonly Magic, though other realms are possible. It is relatively common in Persia and Asia Minor. *(Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, pages 23-24)

# **(Exotic) Sihr, or (Jinni) Summoning**

Like Solomonic Sihr, this Iberian version of the Art can summon and bind a jinni, if the sahir can overpower it with his Summoning Total. It is not very common in the Mythic Middle East, since its Solomonic counterpart is so widespread. (*Houses of Hermes: Societates*, pages 135-136)

## **(Realm) Summoning, or (Faerie) Summoning**

This is a rare Summoning variant targeting creatures from a single realm, and so can potentially summon Divine, Faerie, Magic, or Infernal spirits. Currently the only known version summons faeries (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 131-132), and is found among the yatus of Persia and occasional travelers from Europe, though there are also rumors of a far eastern version aligned to the Divine.



incomes rather than depending on a covenant, the Wealthy Virtue and Poor Flaw have a much greater impact.

Gifted sahirs should occupy the same status as magi. With the troupe's approval, unGifted sahirs may be Mythic Companions, with twice as many points of Virtues as Flaws and a free Minor Virtue, and taking the place of a magus character. Un-Gifted sahirs can also be played as regular companions with the normal amount of Virtues and Flaws.

#### **Virtues and Flaws**

Every sahir accepted into the Suhhar Sulayman takes the Free Sahir Social Status Virtue. Unless he takes the Dark Secret Flaw, he should have the Sihr Virtue or another Virtue or Virtues that allow him to summon spirits. For example, a Kurdish group of sorcerers called the Mulhidun in northern Persia (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 136-137) have (Spirit) Summoning, and many of them have joined the Suhhar*.* There are also two societies of elemental wizards found throughout the region, called the Brethren of Purity and the Students of Avicenna (see *Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, pages 28–32), and a few of them might have a special elementalist summoning art (Theurgical Summoning) and one or more Elementalist Abilities (e.g., Elementalist Fire) that can be used in conjunction to summon an elemental spirit.

A sahir with The Gift and a summon-

ing Virtue or Virtues may begin play after having been initiated into the tradition by another Gifted sahir, with all five of his Solomonic arts opened at 0. He also receives a Minor Virtue at no cost to represent his teacher's influence: usually Puissant (Ability) in the Solomonic art associated with the master's family.

Many sahirs are Educated (see Introduction, Chapter 1) or have Arcane Lore or the Student of Magic Virtue to represent their studies with their mentors. A few sahirs learn their magic from spirits directly, and the Ghostly Warder Virtue is one way to represent this advantage.

Like other characters unaffiliated with a Hermetic covenant, sahirs must spend time every year working to support themselves (this includes their yearly obligation to the Suhhar). For most sahirs, this takes two seasons every year. Characters with the Wealthy Virtue lose only one season a year, and those with the Poor Flaw are free only one season each year. The difference between these two extremes is especially noticeable during character creation; a rich sahir will be many magnitudes more powerful than a poor sahir — nearly all of the greatest sahirs in the history of the Suhhar Sulayman have been wealthy and privileged.

Some sahirs have a long-term mutually beneficial arrangement with a minor spirit, which is best represented by the (Realm) Spirit Companion Flaw. It is not uncommon for young sahirs to have abused or angered spirits before they joined the Suhhar, giving them the Plagued by Spirit or Supernatural Nuisance Flaws.

#### **Experience**

Sahirs receive starting experience like normal companions. They begin character creation with Native Language at 5 and 45 experience points to spend on their first five years. Then, in later life, most sahirs receive 15 experience points per year of their starting age (those with the Wealthy Virtue receive 20 and those with the Poor Flaw receive 10).

Once the sahir has joined the Suhhar, he receives 25 experience points per year (30 if he is Wealthy, 15 if he is Poor). This represents his improved access to study


sources and magical resources.

Players should consider spending the character's experience on the following Abilities:

- • To cast spells, a sahir must have a score of 4 in one of the languages sahirs use (**Arabic**, **Parsi**, or **Greek**). To read and write books, he needs this language score at 5 and **Artes Liberales** 1. (Most of the Suhhar's books are written in Arabic.)
- • Sahirs can often locate new spirits with **Area Lore**.
- **• Bargain** is essential when sahirs want to convince spirits to aid them.
- • Many magical effects require **Concentration** to cast and maintain.
- **• Finesse** is often used to manipulate active magic.
- **• Leadership** allows sahirs to lead groups of spirits, or other sahirs in the laboratory.
- • A sahir is able to summon spirits more effectively with **Penetration**.
- • Sahirs must somehow make a living. Often this is represented with scores in **Profession: Apothecary**, **Profession: Scribe** or **Teaching**, as these trades are typically practiced at buyut al-hikma. Other Abilities can be justified; the character's total in the related Characteristic + Ability should at least equal 6.
- **• Realm Lore** describes spirits and supernatural places, useful for finding and identifying them.
- • Knowledge of the Suhhar is governed by **Organization Lore: Suhhar Sulayman**. Their legal code and belief systems are covered by **Islamic Law** and **Theology: Islam**; the latter combined with an Arabic score of 6 or more can help protect sahirs against jinn (see Chapter 4: The Jinn, Jinni Weaknesses).
- • Sahirs should not neglect the Abilities associated with their Solomonic arts (**Area Lore**, **Artes Liberales**, **Medicine**, **Philosophiae**, and **Realm Lore**), as these scores increase their lab totals and add to their casting totals when they cast spells without magical words or gestures.

Sahirs will likely spend experience on other Abilities appropriate to the character, and on the Solomonic arts and other Supernatural Abilities that they have available to them during character creation because of Virtues, or because they have had The Gift opened by a teacher. A starting sahir should be able to summon a spirit with a Might Score of 10 using his summoning art, and should have a score of at least 5 in one of the five Solomonic arts.

Sahirs can also purchase Solomonic spells during character creation, recorded like Hermetic spells and with a maximum level of (Intelligence + summoning art + Solomonic art + related Ability). Assuming that every sahir studies from appropriate lab texts, each spell costs a number of starting experience points equal to its level. For example, a Level 15 spell costs 15 experience points. Sahirs can start with any spells that their players would like to design.

Spells are extremely valuable to sahirs, and a starting character should always invest in a minimum of 120 spell levels, or his magic will be severely limited.

#### **Spirits**

Spirits are essential for a sahir — without them he cannot cast any spells — and so a good sahir will collect Arcane Connections to appropriate spirits, or learn summoning spells he can use for the same purpose. Also, since the sahir's magic is basically channeled through the spirit he summons, the spirit's nature and personality alters the sahir's magic in subtle ways (in much the same way that spells cast by a Hermetic magus show evidence of his casting sigil). Thus, the unique qualities of the spirit a sahir calls have significant influence on his magic.

A starting sahir should choose one spirit that he can summon to be the focus of most of his magic, and assume that he has an Arcane Connection to it. He should also note something about its personality and powers in order to describe a cosmetic effect that accompanies his magic whenever he involves that spirit. If he has spent any of his experience points on summoning spells, he may choose a spirit for each one. Unless he has a Virtue like Ghostly Warder or a Flaw like Magical Spirit Companion, he cannot assume that any of these spirits will do him any favors without being paid for their services or being compelled by his magic.

#### **Laboratory Activities**

Players can trade 10 experience points during character creation to have their sahirs spend a season in the laboratory instead of studying, but only as many times per year as the character has free seasons. In this season, the character may perform any seasonal summoning activity described under Solomonic Magic. Assume that the character has access to half the maximum amount of vis as he can spend on the activity, and that he is working in an aura with no bonus or penalty. For activities that affect a spirit during character creation, such as the khadim bond or a greater binding, the sahir must have an appropriate Virtue or Flaw that gives him a willing spirit companion.

#### **Aging and Warping**

Characters 35 years or older need to make an Aging roll for each year. Note that knowledge of Solomonic Alchemy and Solomonic Physic can influence the character's Aging rolls (see The Solomonic Art, Magical Defenses, later in this chapter). A typical sahir also gains 2 Warping Points each year after he starts studying and practicing Solomonic magic.

# *Solomonic Magic*

The sahirs' magic comes from their ability to summon spirits and direct them in limited ways. Over the many years they have been practicing this, sahirs have developed ways to modify their summoning powers so that instead of causing a spirit to manifest within a circle or other mystic container, they can draw upon its power to create other magical effects. These supernatural means of affecting a target with Solomonic magic are collectively called "the Solomonic Art," but each power is


also a "Solomonic art." These arts (not technically Arts but rather Accelerated Supernatural Abilities) are described in more detail later in this chapter.

The Solomonic Art can be used in two ways: to quickly cast memorized spells, or for long-term magical projects over a season or more. The former is called **formulaic summoning**, and the latter is called **seasonal summoning**. Every sahir has (or should have) a summoning power, such as Sihr, that is used to summon a spirit or other sort of being and negotiate with it. Sahirs refer to this power as their **summoning art**, but Sihr is sometimes considered a Solomonic art in its own right, and part of the Solomonic art as a whole (see The Solomonic Arts, Sihr).

## *The Cradle & The Crescent Solomonic Spells (Naranjs)*

A sahir's spells are a recipe for drawing upon a summoned spirit's power in a way that creates a magical effect. This formula is called a *naranj* ("spell"). Sahirs generally know many naranjs, which they cast much as Hermetic magi cast their spells — by concentrating for a moment and speaking an incantation while gesturing at the target. Learning to cast a naranj takes a season of work in a special laboratory (described under Seasonal Summoning, in the next part of this section).


The most basic form of naranj available to sahirs uses their summoning art, and summons a spirit to a prepared place within a few paces of the caster. This is called a **summoning spell**. Unlike using their summoning art, this naranj only takes a moment and does not cost any fatigue or vis. The sahir is still warded against the spirit, and as usual the spirit likely wants something in return for whatever service the sahir asks. To cast a summoning spell, the player rolls a stress die and adds Presence plus his score in his summoning art, as well as his modifier for the aura.

**Appearance:** 'Arkhaman is a pale man with black hair, thin eyebrows and a curled moustache. He has an innocent twinkle in his eye and a confident smile. He wears a hooded robe that has seen very little travel, baggy clothes, and he is likely sitting down. The suggestion of a demonic spirit might hover over his left shoulder (see Kharrat, later).

The boy Laqy was born at the bayt al-hikma of Sana'a to a woman who desperately wished to keep him hidden from the imam, her uncle. His father was a spirit of flame, she said, a beautiful jinni with black eyes. Delivered in secret, the child was raised at the academy and desired only to serve the sahirs, but as he grew older, his resemblance to the important family became more pronounced. They decided to bring him into the Suhhar, and initiated him into Sihr. The first spirit he summoned was the being he believes to be his father: an Infernal jinni named Kharrat.

Kharrat is a pompous and arrogant spirit who believes that 'Arkhaman's desire to please his father will lead him to evil, and thinks he has him completely tamed. 'Arkhaman is naive, but has been warned by the older sahirs not to let Kharrat take advantage of him. So far, he has been able to control the jinni with vis, but as soon as possible Kharrat will get him to accept a duty and agree to seek out his mother. The shame that his presence will bring to her delights the wicked spirit.

'Arkhaman only recently manifested The Gift, and the power he now wields has made him a bit wild. When he casts a spell, he often cannot resist casting another (because of his Magic Addiction Flaw), and his presence generally makes those without The Gift uncomfortable (Tainted with Evil). His masters believe he needs to meet other Gifted sahirs or he will go mad; thus they have elected him their vizier and are sending him to Baghdad this summer to represent them.

**Characteristics:** Int 0, Per +1, Pre +3, Com 0, Str +2, Sta +2, Dex +2, Qik +1

**Size:** 0

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Jinni; Greater Malediction (bound by bargains); Weak-Willed

**Personality Traits:** Selfish +5, Proud +3, Cruel +3

**Reputations:** none **Hierarchy:** 1 (Shaitan)

**Combat:**

*Fist:* Init +1, Attack +9, Defense +8, Damage +2

**Abilities:** Arabic 5 (threats), Brawl 6 (fist), Charm 6 (bragging), Concentration 2 (maintaining spells), Folk Ken 3 (temptation), Penetration 3 (Vim), Theology: Islam 1 (jinn)

**Powers:**

*Apparition,* 1 point, Init 0, Imaginem: Kharrat may assume an illusory form that only his chosen victim, 'Arkhaman, can perceive. To 'Arkhaman, the form appears to be a real person in all respects.

*Protection of the Close Friend*, 0 points, Init +3, Mentem: The chosen victim of Kharrat cannot act directly against it without extreme provocation; it would be akin to attacking one's own mother. The victim may be as angry as they like with the demon, but actually physically opposing it requires a huge effort of will, which must be repeated every time the victim wants to renew his attacks.

*Control Human*, 2 points, Init equal to Qik, Mentem. If this power penetrates, Kharrat exerts direct control over its companion. It can issue commands that the target carries out to the best of his abilities; however, the target can attempt to break the control of the jinni every time he is asked to do something contrary to the tenets of his faith.

*Envisioning*, 1 or 2 points, Init +2, Mentem. This Power allows Kharrat to appear in the dreams of its sleeping companion (in which case it costs 1 point), or make the target experience a waking dream or vision (in which case it costs 5 points). The shaitan cannot instantly make substantial changes to a dream, but instead gradually twists it to take on darker and more frightening tone, and can speak through any figure from the victim's subconscious. A waking dream is more obvious; the victim suffers an immediate and powerful hallucination of whatever the demon desires. This may be so frightening that the victim is stunned for a round, and must make a Brave Personality roll against an ease Factor of 9 or have an extreme reaction, such as retching, convulsions, or abject terror. This is the preferred way a qareen commu-

nicates with its chosen companion. *Coagulation*, 2 points, Init –1, Corpus: See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 31.

*Obsession*, 1 to 3 points, Init –5, Vim: Overconfident. See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 31.

**Weakness:** Protected Group (A victim who willingly and totally rejects him, fueled with a Confidence Point), Protected Group (individuals that invoke the Bismallah invocation)

**Vis:** 2 pawns of Ignem in its eyes

**Appearance:** Kharrat looks like a normal man with pale skin and completely black eyes that give off smoke like smoldering coals. He is generally in spirit form, where no one can see him.

Kharrat is a pompous and arrogant jinni (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). He desires nothing more than to corrupt and control the sahir named 'Arkhaman, who believes him to be his father. At every opportunity, he encourages 'Arkhaman to behave recklessly and with sinful pride by goading him through his dreams, or by affecting him with his *Obsession* power. His plan is to help 'Arkhaman to become a powerful sahir under his control, and then force him to help Kharrat rise in the infernal hierarchy by fighting other demons.

When used to channel Solomonic magic, Kharrat is strongly associated with a sickly shade of yellow, like tarnished brass or sandy mud. This colors 'Arkhaman's magic much like a wizard's sigil affects Hermetic spells.

**Summoning Total: stress die + Presence + summoning art + aura**

> **Ease Factor: spirit's Might Score**

To succeed, the sahir must penetrate the summoned spirit's Magic Resistance. Just as magi often do, sahirs can use Arcane Connections and sympathetic magic to boost their penetration — and since Solomonic summoning spells are designed to affect specific spirits, each summoning spell incorporates the spirit's True Name, which is a permanent Arcane Connection to that spirit. This allows the player to add 5 to the sahir's Penetration score multiplier when casting that particular summoning spell or using other Supernatural Abilities that must penetrate that spirit's Magic Resistance to have an effect. (This usually means that the sahir multiplies his Penetration score by 6, since his multiplier starts at 1.)

**Penetration Total: Summoning Total + sahir's Penetration bonus – spirit's Might Score**

**Formulaic and Ritual Spells**

The most common type of naranj that sahirs learn are **formulaic spells**, which require that the sahir has already summoned a spirit and convinced it to serve him. (For


## *Spells with Arcane Connections*

Solomonic magic allows sahirs to invent summoning spells that incorporate a permanent Arcane Connection. This is very similar to a True Name, a supernatural formula similar to a spell that mystically identifies the target. Like any Arcane Connection, summoning spells do not stack with other Arcane Connections for increased Penetration, but may be combined with sympathetic connections such as the spirit's horoscope or a symbolic representation of it for additional bonuses. These summoning spells and their associated Arcane Connections can be taught to other sahirs and described in texts like any other spell.

Solomonic magic has not yet incorporated Arcane Connections into other types of spells — perhaps because sahirs have few uses for an Arcane Connection once they have summoned a spirit though this may be something that they are working on. Also, such a discovery would be a great benefit to magi, and an excellent subject for original Hermetic research (see Integration, Hermetic True Names, later in this chapter).

a sahir with a spirit companion, this means that he must still formally summon the spirit using a summoning spell or his summoning art before it can channel his magic for him.) They use the sahir's knowledge of the Art to direct his summoned spirit's power into a magical effect.

When casting formulaic spells, the sahir must have summoned the spirit that powers the effect himself, he must be close enough to the spirit that it can see him and hear his voice, and he must either speak in a firm voice with bold gestures or perform a mundane activity associated with the effect. For example, when casting a formulaic spell associated with Solomonic Physic, the sahir may choose to administer to the patient as a physician rather than obviously performing sorcery.

Using an Ability in this way generally adds about 15 minutes per magnitude of the spell to the casting time, but becomes more difficult to recognize as a magical effect. For example, to see through the cover activity, a suspicious character might roll his Perception + the Ability against the sahir's Presence + the Ability. Success would suggest to the suspicious character that the sahir is doing something unusual, though he still might not know what that is.

Whenever a sahir summons a spirit, either using a summoning spell or his summoning art, note the difference between his Summoning Total and the spirit's Might Score. This is called the sahir's **Summoning Strength**. It describes the amount of extra supernatural power that the sahir has drawn from the spirit during the summoning, and applies to every naranj cast through that particular spirit (and typically improves his position when bargaining with it as well).

Some summoning arts allow the sahir to summon a spirit even if his total does not exceed the target's Might Score; a negative Summoning Strength means the sahir is less able to direct his magic through that particular spirit, and thus gives him a penalty to his casting total.

#### **Summoning Strength: Summoning Total – spirit's Might Score**

Casting a formulaic spell requires that the sahir's player make a stress roll, to which is added his Presence, his score in the Solomonic art associated with the effect, his Summoning Strength, and his aura modifier. If the sahir performs the effect using an Ability, add his Ability score to the total.

**Formulaic Spell Casting Total: stress die + Presence + Solomonic art + Summoning Strength + aura (+ appropriate Ability, if used)**

**Ritual spells** are more powerful formulaic spells. They cost vis — one pawn of an appropriate type for each magnitude of the effect — and have ongoing durations that are maintained by the spirit and can last indefinitely. Any formulaic spell can be cast as a ritual spell, allowing the sahir greater control over the effect (described in the guidelines later in this chapter). There are also many special guidelines for effects that are only ritual spells.

To maintain a ritual spell, the spirit must concentrate. If it is distracted, make a Stamina + Concentration stress roll for it, with the Ease Factor varying on the severity of distraction. Failure means the effect ends.

Whenever a sahir casts a naranj through a spirit that is already maintaining one or more ritual spells, the sahir's player makes a Perception + Finesse roll with Ease Factor equal to (6 x (the number of active ritual spells)). If he fails, he cannot complete the spell and it has no effect. Most ritual spells allow the sahir to cancel them at will, and he may choose to do this before he rolls.

Ritual spells cannot be disguised with an Ability, although the sahir may still draw upon his knowledge to increase his Casting Total. This adds fifteen minutes per magnitude of the spell to the casting time. Note that unlike Hermetic ritual spells, Solomonic ritual spells cast without incorporating an Ability only take a moment to cast, just like a formulaic spell.

**Ritual Spell Casting Total: spend vis, stress die + Presence + Solomonic art + Summoning Strength + aura (+ appropriate Ability, if used)**

With both types of naranj, if the sahir's Casting Total is less than the level, his Summoning Strength with that spirit is reduced by the difference, and he loses one Fatigue level for every 5 levels by which he missed. If this fatigue causes him to fall unconscious, the spell fails; otherwise, the effect manifests.

If the target is protected by Magic Resistance, the effect must penetrate. To determine success, players use the spirit's Penetration Total instead of the sahir's, applying its realm interaction modifiers to determine if the target is affected. (This often means that it is advantageous for the sahir to summon an Infernal spirit when casting in an Infernal aura, for example.)

Because the sahir is using the spirit's power to penetrate, he cannot use Arcane Connections or sympathetic magic to boost the Penetration Total for his for-

mulaic or ritual spells, and the calculation always uses the spirit's Penetration score, not the sahir's.

> **Formulaic or Ritual Spell Penetration Total: spirit's Might Score + spirit's Penetration bonus + spirit's aura modifier – spell level**

Finally, unless the sahir has The Gift, the highest level of formulaic or ritual spell he can cast is limited by the summoned spirit's Might Score. For example, to cast a Level 35 formulaic spell, an unGifted sahir must summon a spirit with 35 Might or more. The Gift allows a sahir to make up the difference between his spirit's Might and the effect level with his own inherent magical power, but unGifted sahirs do not have this advantage.

> **Spell Level Limit (unGifted): Might Score of summoned spirit**

When sahirs botch their casting rolls, they receive one Warping Point for each 0 on the botch dice. If this gives them two or more Warping Points, they must check for additional bad effects (see Warping and Corruption, later in this chapter).

#### **Vis (Taqa)**

Sahirs use a great deal of vis, and they tend to describe it in unique terms, such as "the claw from the black beast Ashmael" or "magic incense made by Istvaan al-Makki." The general term they use is *taqa* (TAWqa), which is also a unit of measurement. For example, a sahir might say he has four taqa in a red stone, warm to the touch; or a single taqa in the pelt of a holy lamb, innocent and pure. One taqa is functionally equivalent to one Hermetic pawn.

By activating vis, a sahir can increase his Casting Total when casting formulaic or ritual spells. Each vis of a type appropriate to the effect gives him a +2 bonus. He can also increase his Summoning Total when casting a summoning spell using vis (this improves both his penetration and his Summoning Strength). Each vis that matches the form of the summoned spirit's Might gives him a +2 bonus, and any other type gives him a +1 bonus. He cannot spend more on a single naranj than his score in the associated art, however.

**Vis Limit: score in summoning art (summoning spell) or Solomonic art (formulaic or ritual spell)**

When casting ritual spells, the vis required for the effect counts toward this limit. This means that to cast a ritual spell, the sahir's score in the associated art must always at least equal its magnitude.

## *Seasonal Summoning*

The other sort of Solomonic magic is called seasonal summoning, because it takes place over the course of a season. At the beginning of the process the sahir summons a spirit to him, and draws upon that spirit's supernatural power over the course of the season to enable more intensive magical activities. It is essentially the sahir's equivalent to Hermetic laboratory magic.

The sahir performing a seasonal activity must have summoned a spirit at the beginning of the project, which must remain present for the entire season or his effort is wasted. It must maintain the effects as it does for ritual spells, essentially concentrating on what the sahir is doing, and so it cannot activate its powers or perform any other activities that require its attention that season.

Most seasonal activities use a standardized total — called a "lab total" for convenience — this is the sahir's Intelligence, his



score in the Solomonic art associated with the effect, his score in the mundane Ability associated with the lab activity, and his Summoning Strength with the spirit that is assisting him that season. He also receives his aura modifier for performing magic.

#### **Lab Total:**

**Intelligence + appropriate Solomonic art + appropriate Ability + Summoning Strength + aura**

This is shortened later as a "(Solomonic art) + (Ability) Lab Total," specifying the art and Ability associated with each activity.

As with spells, unless the sahir has The Gift, all of his effects are limited by the spirit's Might Score — for example, a sahir who has summoned a spirit with 15 Might cannot invent spells greater than Level 15.

**Lab Effect Level Limit (unGifted): spirit's Might Score**

#### **A Solomonic Laboratory**

Like Hermetic labs, a sahir's work space must be a room protected from the elements with at least 500 cubic paces of space. It requires equipment appropriate to the sahir's fields of expertise and proper organization of materials; this takes a person with an academic and arcane background a single season to set up, after which it may be used with a –3 penalty to all activities.

If a Solomonic laboratory is established or reorganized by a person with a score of 3 in one of the five Abilities associated with the Art (Area Lore, Artes Liberales, Medicine, Philosophiae, or Realm Lore), then the penalty to that activity is eliminated. For example, a sahir with Artes Liberales 3 and Philosophiae 3 could establish a laboratory with no penalty for alchemical (Philosophiae) or astrological activities (Artes Liberales), but would still have a –3 penalty to other lab activities.

Literate sahirs working in laboratories take notes, usually in Arabic, which can produce lab texts that other sahirs may study. These work just like Hermetic lab texts (**ArM5**, pages 101–102).

Sahirs can also assist each other in the laboratory, and this practice is much more common in the Suhhar than in the Order of Hermes — so much so that their process is more efficient and effective than the Hermetic version. All participants must have the required Solomonic arts, and one of the sahirs working on the project must have a Leadership score equal to (the number of participants – 1). Each sahir who participates in the project adds his Intelligence to the lab total, plus his score in the Ability related to the effect, and the final result uses the highest value among the participants in the appropriate Solomonic art. Only the sahir with the highest Solomonic art must summon a spirit to assist them that season. This means that it is common to involve a competent manager in a Solomonic lab activity, even one with a negative Intelligence, because it increases the number of sahirs who can work together.

Not counting time spent away from the lab for sleep and weekly religious observances, sahirs may miss up to ten days of a seasonal activity with no penalty. Beyond this, the sahir's lab total receives a –10 penalty, and –2 for each work day missed. If multiple sahirs are working together, the number of person-days that may be missed with no penalty is multiplied by the number of participants, and any penalty is divided by this same number, rounding up. For example, three sahirs may miss up to 10 days each with no penalty, or only one of them may miss up to 30 days. If together they miss a total of 34 days (perhaps because two were absent 10 days and the third was gone for 14 days), their lab total would receive a –6 penalty (–10 for more than 30 days, –2 for each of four days over 30, yielding a penalty of –18, divided by 3 for –6). Players should not include the scores for any sahirs who fail to contribute at least 10 days of work, and if any individual sahir's penalty before dividing exceeds the overall lab total, the entire project simply fails.

Sahirs can perform more than one lab activity in a season. Add together the effect levels required for all of the activities, and use the lowest lab total among them. As long as this is great enough to equal or exceed the sum of all effect levels, any number of activities may be performed at once. For those activities where progress is measured by how much the sahir's lab total exceeds the effect level, divide the excess among all activities, rounding down any fractions.

#### **Vis Manipulation**

A sahir with Solomonic Alchemy can extract vis from a supernatural aura as a seasonal activity, concentrating the power of the realm into a specific object. This produces a number of pawns of what magi call Vim vis, equal to one-tenth his Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total.

**Vis Extraction: pawns equal to (Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total) / 10**

Sahirs can also forcefully remove vis from supernatural beings or enchanted objects. This is an excruciating process for creatures that feel pain, which must be restrained for the season, and is considered a grave offense by the Suhhar when practiced on unwilling jinn or other intelligent spirits.

A maximum number of vis equal to one-fifth of the sahir's Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total can be removed in one season. For each pawn removed, either the supernatural being's Might Score is reduced by 1, one invested effect is removed from an enchanted device, or one pawn's worth of space is cleared from an invested object with no invested effects. If the sahir's (lab total / 5) is greater than the pawns this would yield, no additional vis is produced. Removed vis is affiliated with the realm of the being or the power that created the enchanted object, and is of a type appropriate to the effect or Might of the being.

**Vis Removal: pawns equal to (Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total) / 5**

A sahir can also transfer vis from one object into another, a number of pawns equal to half his Solomonic Alchemy


**Naranjs**

+ Philosophiae Lab Total. This is commonly used to separate large chunks of vis into more manageable units, and does not work on vis that is part of a living creature or has been invested into an enchanted device. The process usually destroys the original vessel, and if an object contains more vis than the sahir can transfer, the excess is lost.

**Vis Transfer: pawns equal to (Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total) / 2**

Sahirs have a limit on the number of pawns of vis they can use on any seasonal activity, equal to their score in the associated Solomonic art. For example, a sahir with Solomonic Alchemy 10 can only extract 10 pawns of vis from an aura in a single season.

**Vis Limit: score in associated Solomonic art**

#### **Arcane Connections**

Like Hermetic magi, sahirs can fix Arcane Connections, making them permanent. This costs them a pawn of Vim vis, and requires a score of at least 1 in Solomonic Astrology (because of the vis limit). When performing multiple activities in one season, this activity is considered a Level 5 effect.

> **Fix Arcane Connections: Solomonic Astrology + Artes Liberales Lab Total**

Sahirs can also transfer an Arcane Connection from one object to another. This requires a pawn of Vim vis and an appropriate object to become the new connection. I t does not affect the original connection, and so creates a new Arcane Connection. When performing multiple activities in one season, this is considered a Level 5 effect.

> **Transfer Arcane Connections: Solomonic Astrology + Artes Liberales Lab Total**

Sahirs learn their spells using the same mechanics as magi. They can invent a number of formulaic or ritual spells with total level equal to their teacher's highest applicable lab total, substituting the teacher's score in Teaching for the associated Ability; or by the sahir collecting enough points above the spell level in the associated art + Ability lab total over the course of one or more seasons to equal it. Sahirs often make use of laboratory texts to speed this process.

**Learning Spells: spell levels equal to teacher's highest applicable Teaching Lab Total**

**Inventing Formulaic or Ritual Spells: (appropriate art + appropriate Ability Lab Total – effect level) points towards spell level**

Summoning spells use the teacher's Solomonic Astrology + Teaching Lab Total or the sahir's Solomonic Astrology + Artes Liberales Lab Total (though summoning spells are so widespread that the sahir does not need to know Solomonic Astrology to do this). The spell level is the spirit's Might Score, and unless the sahir has a Laboratory Text he must possess an Arcane Connection to the spirit, or else it must be present in the lab for part of the season.

If a sahir knows the True Name of a spirit (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 34-35*)*, he can reinvent it as a summoning spell as if it were a Level 5 effect.

**Inventing Summoning Spells: (Solomonic Astrology + Artes Liberales Lab Total – effect level) points towards spell level**

**Bindings**

Sahirs can attach their summoned spirits to inanimate objects, essentially creating magical devices that produce a magical effect designed especially for the object when activated. These are called **bindings**. They can be given to others to use, even others who do not understand Solomonic magic. It is said the Umayyad wazirs and other early summoners who knew this process created many such devices, some of which still exist in hidden caches in the desert or within musty dwellings used by ancient sorcerers. Jabir, one of the members of the First Council, is said to have possessed a binding created by Solomon himself.

The first type of binding is known as a **lesser binding**. This superficially ties the spirit to an object, creating a mystical connection between the two, and includes a trigger activity that releases the effect in a momentary burst of power. Lesser bindings take a season to make, and can hold any effect the sahir can invent, with level of up to half the sahir's Philosophiae Lab Total. When binding ritual spell effects, the sahir spends the necessary vis as part of making the enchantment, and once activated the effect lasts for as long as the spirit maintains it.

**Lesser Bindings: effect level equal to (appropriate art + Philosophiae Lab Total) / 2**

Sahirs can also create a **greater binding**. This is where the spirit is held captive by an object to power an effect. The effects invested into this object continue indefinitely, and may activate repeatedly: each time someone performs a trigger action associated with an effect, that effect ends and is immediately cast again on another target chosen by the wielder. If the object is damaged or destroyed, all active effects cease and the associated spirits are freed. While bound, the spirit may be summoned, but it cannot use any of its powers, regenerate its Might Pool, move from where it is summoned, communicate more than short sentences, power Solomonic naranjs, or maintain other ritual spells. The Suhhar forbids sahirs from binding an intelligent spirit in this way, but there are many types of unintelligent spirits that are ideal for this sort of application (elemental spirits, for example).

To make a greater binding, the sahir must first enchant the object by which the spirit will be held captive. This enchant-


ment binds the spirit and any invested effects with Vim vis, which must be transferred into the object over the course of a season, "opening" it for the binding. Every object has a maximum number of pawns of vis it can hold, found by calculating the number of Base Points for the object's size and material on the Material and Size Table (**ArM5**, page 97). There is no benefit to sahirs for using an object of any particular shape or material except one: a literal container (a bowl, jar, bottle, lamp, or even a skull) can hold twice as many pawns of vis, and the sahir receives a +5

bonus to his Lab Total whenever he binds

an effect to it. The maximum number of pawns of vis the sahir can transfer into an enchantment in one season is equal to his Solomonic Alchemy score, but he may add vis to an enchantment in subsequent seasons as long as the maximum has not been reached. Enchanting an object for a greater binding is a Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae activity with level equal to the number of pawns invested. It is possible to open an object for enchantment and bind a spirit and effect to it in one season, as long as the character's Lab Total is great enough to accommodate both activities.

**Binding Enchantments:** 

**(Solomonic Alchemy + Philosophiae Lab Total – pawns of vis to be invested) points towards the number of pawns of vis to be invested**

To bind a spirit and effect to an enchanted device, design the effect as a spell using the sahir's Philosophiae Lab Total with the associated art. Each magnitude of the spirit's Might Score and each magnitude of the effect takes up "space" in the object equal to one pawn from the initial enchantment. As long as there is enough space in the enchantment to accommodate both the effect level and the Might of the spirit, the sahir can perform the binding. He can even bind the spirit and effect in one season if his Philosophiae Lab Total is at least double the effect level; otherwise it takes multiple seasons to accumulate enough points to complete it.

**Greater Bindings: (appropriate art + Philosophiae Lab Total – effect level) points towards effect level**

A sahir without Solomonic Alchemy may still bind spirits and effects to an ob-


The sahir can place additional effects into the object in later seasons, as long as there is still space available, either by binding more spirits to the object or by binding the effect to a spirit that is already imprisoned in it. A bound spirit can only maintain one effect at a time.

When the wielder activates a greater binding with a ritual effect, the bound spirit must spend a Might Point for each magnitude of the effect, which the spirit does not recover for as long as it is bound. If the spirit runs out of Might Points, its Might Score is reduced by 1 and its Might Pool is replenished. Once its Might Score is reduced to 0, it can do nothing but maintain the last effect it triggered. Spirits do usually regain their lost Might Scores eventually, though this typically takes a very long time, at least a year per Point lost, and often longer.

A binding is an Arcane Connection to the bound spirit, and the spirit knows the triggering actions to activate the device. For sahirs, investigating enchantments is often as simple as summoning the spirit and asking what it can do.

#### **Seeking and Scouring**

A sahir can locate new spirits to summon as a seasonal lab activity. This requires knowledge of Solomonic Storytelling, an applicable Area Lore Ability, an Arcane Connection to the area he is searching, and a pawn of form-appropriate vis. The sahir casts a kind of magical net over the area that finds and holds an appropriate spirit. Then, he may either invite the spirit to visit him in his laboratory, which is called seeking, or force the spirit to come to him, which is called scouring. The maximum value of the spirit's Might Score is equal to the sahir's Solomonic Storytelling + Area Lore Lab Total when seeking, or half the that total when scouring.

**Maximum Might Score (Seeking): Solomonic Storytelling + appropriate Area Lore Lab Total**



Either activity brings a spirit applicable to the sahir's summoning art by the end of the season, causing it to appear within a magic summoning circle that prevents it from affecting anyone or anything outside the ring for as long as it remains unbroken. When summoned by seeking, the spirit may return to where it came from at any time; when summoned by scouring the spirit is held captive. In either case, the sahir can return it by simply looking at it and concentrating.

The sahir cannot decide what spirit comes, as the magic targets the area, not individual spirits. This means that the spirit summoned by this activity is essentially up to the storyguide to describe. See the various *Realms of Power* books for powers a summoned spirit might have, and what spirits with different Might Scores look like. In the Mythic Middle East, jinn are common, as are elemental spirits. Infernal spirits are also especially likely (though since it is a form of magical detection, they are never forced to answer a scouring), and Divine spirits are generally unlikely. Ultimately, the storyguide should choose a spirit for the sahir that will enhance the story the players are telling.

#### **Warding**

A sahir can enchant an area or object with the power to repel spirits appropriate to his summoning art. The sahir devotes a season to preparing the effect, and then draws a mystic circle on the ground or on an object and ceremonially imbues it with magic by spending a pawn of Vim vis. (The vis and the formula for the ward may be taken from the laboratory and used once to enchant a circle drawn in an outside location, as long as both the sahir and the spirit through which he casts it participated in the lab activity.)

Any spirits normally targeted by the sahir's summoning art cannot touch the person carrying the object or affect him with their powers, or cannot cross the circle or affect anything on the other side of it. They also cannot affect the enchanted circle or the object itself. These effects last until the object is damaged or destroyed, or the circle is broken, either deliberately or by the deteriorating forces of age or climate.

Creating a ward is a Solomonic Travel + (Realm) Lore activity, of the realm affiliated with the sahir's summoning art, and his lab total determines the maximum Might Score the ward can affect.

#### **Maximum Might Score Warded: Solomonic Travel + (Realm) Lore Lab Total**

Solomonic wards must penetrate the Magic Resistance of any spirits affected by them. Calculate the sahir's Penetration Total based on the Might of the spirit powering the effect, minus the level of the ward. As with spells, the sahir cannot improve the spirit's Penetration bonus with Arcane Connections, though a supernatural aura at the site of the ward can modify the effect's Penetration Total.

#### **Servant Spirits (***Khuddam***)**

An intelligent spirit that agrees to serve a sahir and assist him with his magic may be enchanted with special properties that help the sahir whenever he casts spells through that spirit. This spirit is called a *khadim* (fem., *khadima;* pl., *khuddam*), meaning "servant," and the enchantment is called "the khadim bond." These terms are thought to derive from the name Al-Khidr, the spirit who served Al-Hajjaj of the First Council among others, and thus "servant" does not have a derogatory or submissive connotation in this context.

To establish the khadim bond, the sahir generates a Realm Lore Lab Total no less than the spirit's Might Score, using the Realm Lore associated with the spirit and his highest Solomonic art. He must also spend a number of form-appropriate pawns of vis equal to the magnitude of the spirit's Might Score. This gives the sahir the same number of Bond Points (equal to the magnitude of the spirit's Might Score) to spend on the following benefits:

**Safety:** Subtract 1 botch die from the sahir's summoning, casting, and Fatra Bayna Avoidance rolls (see Warping and Corruption, later in this section).

**Casting:** Add 2 to the sahir's Casting Total. **Finesse:** Add 3 to the sahir's Finesse rolls. **Concentration:** Add 2 to both the spirit's and the sahir's Concentration rolls.

**Penetration:** Add 5 to the spirit's Penetration Total.

From then on, whenever the sahir summons and casts spells through that spirit, he receives the benefits of all Bond Points he has invested into it. These benefits are purchased on a pyramid scale, so that 3 Bond Points spent on Safety subtracts 2 botch dice, and 10 Bond Points spent on Penetration yields a +20 bonus. A sahir may perform the lab activity more than once with the same spirit, but this only allows him to reallocate his Bond Points; the benefits are not cumulative. A sahir can create bonds with multiple spirits, though the same spirit cannot have a bond with more than one sahir.

**Enchanting a Khadim: highest Solomonic art + (Realm) Lore Lab Total, equal to spirit's Might Score**

#### *Al-Iksir* **(The Elixir of Life)**

The secret of Al-Iksir was said to have been brought to the original council by Al-Hajjaj, who received it from Al-Khidr. The sahir summons a spirit into a liquid concocted from vis and other materials and then consumes it, taking properties of the spirit into himself. This frees the spirit and purifies the sahir, giving him a taste of immortality in exchange for experiencing Warping and other effects. The process is intensely personal, and while a sahir can invent his own formula based on another sahir's laboratory text, he cannot make one for anyone but himself.

Al-Iksir is a Medicine activity, using any of the traditional Solomonic arts: Solomonic Alchemy purifies the body, Solomonic Astrology aligns the sahir with beneficial influences, Solomonic Physic promotes overall health, Solomonic Story-


telling nourishes the soul, and Solomonic Travel exposes the sahir to favorable otherworldly environments.

#### **Al-Iksir: highest Solomonic art + Medicine Lab Total**

The process takes a season of effort, and costs a number of form-appropriate pawns of vis equal to the sahir's (Lab Total / 5). This gives him the same number of Al-Iksir Points to spend on the following beneficial effects:

**Al-Iksir Points:** 1

**Beneficial Effects:** Remove an Aging Point; Reduce Age and Apparent Age by 2; Reduce Apparent Age by 10

**Al-Iksir Points: Points** equal to the absolute value of the Characteristic. **Beneficial Effects:** Improve a decreased

Characteristic by 1, though not above the character's starting score.

After the potion is consumed, the sahir must also spend the same number of Al-Iksir Points on the following negative effects:

#### **Al-Iksir Points:** 1

**Negative Effects:** Gain two Warping Points and check for Fatra Bayna (see Warping and Corruption); Lose memories and associated knowledge, removing a simple die's worth of experience points, usually starting with childhood.

#### **Al-Iksir Points:** 2

**Negative Effects:** Gain an eccentric Personality Trait at +3, or increase this Trait by 1 if the sahir already has one, which becomes an obsession at +6 and madness at +10.

**Al-Iksir Points:** 3

**Negative Effects:** Gain a Minor Flaw appropriate to the spirit's influence.

The spirit's Might Score is also temporarily reduced by the number of Al-Iksir Points spent; this lost Might generally returns at the rate of one point per year.

Once a sahir takes the potion, he begins to age as an adult, even if he is not yet 35 years of age. For this reason, most sahirs wait until they reach old age before concocting Al-Iksir, preferring to experience its dramatic changes much later in life. Note also that sahirs have no way to remove Decrepitude Points, which will continue to accumulate as they gain Aging Points, and which will still eventually lead them to aging crises and death.

#### **Initiating the Arts**

It is a relatively simple process for a Gifted teacher to pass on the Solomonic arts to another student with The Gift. The teacher, a spirit summoned by the teacher, and the student with a summoning art spend a season together in a Solomonic lab, and the teacher performs a powerful ritual that opens all five Solomonic arts. This is a Magic Lore activity that is also associated with Solomonic Travel, but since it has been fully integrated into Solomonic magic, it does not require that the teacher possess that art.

Any art in which the teacher does not have at least a score of 5 gives the student the Deficient Technique Flaw. If the student has any non-Solomonic Supernatural Abilities or Arts, add their scores together and double the result, adding 10 if The Gift has already been opened. Compare this to the teacher's Opening Total, which is half his Solomonic Travel + Magic Lore Lab Total; if this Opening Total is less than the sum of the character's scores in his powers, the teacher cannot initiate the student.

> **Opening Total: (Solomonic Travel + Magic Lore Lab Total) / 2**

In order to pass on the magical secrets associated with the Art of Solomon to those who did not have The Gift, Muhammad al-Fazari — one of the six unGifted members of the First Council — discovered how to use his guardian spirit to initiate them through the power of the Magic Realm. Many of his line believe that this discovery, more than any other, led to the golden age of sahirs and the formation of the Suhhar Sulayman. This process also works on Gifted students who have already been opened to another tradition, and for sahirs without a summoning art or who come to the tradition from another one, this is typically their best method of entry.

The process involves the teacher summoning a willing spirit to carry the student, in spirit form, into the Magic Realm. During the season, the student undergoes a sort of dream journey appropriate to the spirit, while his physical body remains in the lab in a deep sleep. The experience is very similar to what happens to Hermetic magi when they experience Twilight — he might find himself in the physical world, but in a ghostly form that is unable to affect his surroundings; or in a surreal environment surrounded by other spirits interrogating him, urging him to prove his worth; or reliving events of his past as if they were happening to him again.

While the student is in this state, his teacher performs the opening ritual and calculates his Opening Total. If this is 30 or more, the student gains a Major Virtue associated with the Art of Solomon that is also possessed by the teacher, usually a Solomonic or a summoning art. With a total of 25, he gains the Major Virtue but also receives a Minor Flaw. With only 15, he gains the Major Virtue and a Major Flaw. These Flaws should be tied to the student's travels in the Magic Realm.

Before the process is complete, the teacher spends form-appropriate vis equal to half the necessary Opening Total (7, 12, or 15 pawns of vis), and the spirit's Might Score is reduced by the same amount. This reduction is not permanent, but it generally takes at least a year for the spirit to recover each point. The student also gains two Warping Points, though no check for Fatra Bayna (see Warping and Corruption, later in this section) is required.

To initiate an unGifted student in a summoning art and all five Solomonic arts using this method is time-consuming, visconsuming, and Might-consuming, and tends to produce sahirs with a weak grasp on reality due to accumulated Warping and Flaws. This is why unGifted sahirs tend to group in families, and generally teach their summoning art and Solomonic specialty only.



While it is nothing so grand as Hermetic arcane experimentation, sahirs have a means of producing unexpected results in their laboratories, and by sharing these discoveries they can improve their tradition's magic in slow and incremental steps. Because it requires that the sahir have more than one Solomonic art or power, Gifted sahirs tend to be the most inventive.

When designing a new effect, either inventing a formula or binding a spirit, the sahir may declare that he is experimenting by incorporating a second art or another power into the effect. His lab total then uses the lower of these two Abilities or Arts, and the player adds a simple die to the sahir's lab total. The player should give the storyguide some idea of what he is hoping to achieve, based on the two powers.

After the project is completed, the sahir makes an experimental stress roll. On a 0, check for botches to see if there is a disaster; otherwise the result is a story event determined by the storyguide. If the die result is 12 or more, the sahir makes a unique discovery related to one or both of the powers included, which replaces the original effect. For all other rolls, the results include a side effect related to the secondary power. For example, a Storytelling/Astrology spell to put people to sleep might also tell the sahir the sleeping characters' names.

Sahirs with Solomonic Astrology may apply one-fifth of their Solomonic Astrology score to these rolls (see The Solomonic Art, Magical Defense Bonuses, later in this chapter). This does not prevent them from botching if they roll a 0, but makes a discovery more likely. Sahirs with the Inventive Genius Virtue may similarly add 3 to these rolls.

If multiple sahirs are working together on an experimental project, the players make a die roll for each participant, modified by appropriate Virtues and Solomonic Astrology scores, but also subtracting the number of participants from all of their totals. For example, if there are three sahirs working together, each of them receives a –3 to their result. If no one botches and at least one character achieves a total of 12 or more, they make a unique discovery. Otherwise, there is an appropriate side effect.

Unique discoveries from an experiment can be used to improve Solomonic magic in much the same way that magi improve Hermetic theory. If the sahir achieves a discovery and spends a subsequent season duplicating his efforts, and gets no 0s on the experimentation rolls, he stabilizes it and generates a number of Breakthrough Points equal to the effect's magnitude. (He also gains this many Warping Points minus a simple die.) These Breakthrough Points accumulate to produce Minor, Major, or Solomonic Breakthroughs that can change how sahirs practice magic. (See *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, pages 26-30.)

## *Warping and Corruption*

When a sahir receives two or more Warping Points as a result of a magical botch, there is the chance that he will lose control. Instead of channeling the spirit's power as he desires, the spirit's power overtakes him. He typically blacks out and awakens in another place: lost in an otherworldly desert with nine moons and sand of every color; or perhaps held as a prisoner in the castle of his enemy, locked in a dark dungeon; or perhaps even bound in the position of his summoned spirit, watching as the spirit performs magic while drawing upon the sahir's own life energy. Sahirs call this place (which many believe is separate from the Magic Realm) *Bayna* ((BEY-na), "Between"), and the experience *Fatra Bayna* ((FA-tra BEY-na), "Time Between").

Upon gaining the Warping Points, the sahir's player may make a Stamina + Concentration roll (Solomonic Travel gives a Magical Defense Bonus to this roll, as described later). The Ease Factor is a stress die (no botch possible), plus the sahir's Warping Score, plus the number of Warping Points he received, plus his aura modifier. If he rolls a 0, roll a botch die for each Warping Point gained. Success means there is no other effect. If he fails, he experiences Fatra Bayna.

**Fatra Bayna Avoidance: stress die + Stamina + Concentration + Solomonic Travel bonus vs. stress die (no botch) + Warping Score + Warping Points received + aura**

summoned spirits are released from his control, dispelled whether they want to depart or not, and all his active ritual effects end. What happens to his body varies; for some, it remains in stasis or transforms into a spirit form, while for others it continues to react and respond as if controlled by one of his summoned spirits. Some sahirs describe the experience as similar to what they imagine it is like for intelligent spirits, like jinn, when they are bound to an object or person against their will. The character continues to age while he is away, though he does not starve, asphyxiate, or suffer from exposure in the meantime. Fatra Bayna lasts approximately two

During Fatra Bayna, all of the sahir's

minutes at minimum, to approximately one year maximum. This duration is determined by a secret simple die roll according to the following chart. The sahir's player does have some influence over the results, even though he does not see the roll; he may add or subtract 3 by spending a Confidence Point, and if the sahir possesses Solomonic Travel, the player may also add or subtract his Magical Defense Bonus. (Players should add to the roll if they want a better chance of positive effects, or subtract from it for fewer Warping Points and less time spent away from the physical world.)

| Die roll  | Duration E | ffects            |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 or less | Diameter   | +3 Corruption Pts |
| 2–4       | Sun        | +2 Corruption Pts |
| 5–7       | Moon       | +1 Corruption Pt  |
| 8–9       | Season     | +1 Spirit Pt      |
| 10+       | Year       | +3 Spirit Pts     |

When he returns, the sahir receives a number of Warping Points equal to the modified roll, and a number of Spirit or Corruption Points, as indicated on the chart. These are similar to experience points in that they must be spent immediately; Spirit Points provide beneficial effects and Corruption Points negative effects. Sahirs are more likely to gain Corruption Points than Spirit Points, and for this reason Fatra Bayna is generally regarded as a phenomenon that punishes careless sahirs. Those who benefit from it are admired (or envied) for their wisdom and endurance.

Also, whenever a sahir's Warping Score increases, he automatically receives an additional Corruption Point, which must be


spent next time he experiences Fatra Bayna.

The storyguide may spend Spirit Points as follows:

**Spirit Points:** 1

**Effects:** Gain (Warping Score x 5)

experience points in a summoning or Solomonic art;

The sahir invents a new naranj with a level no greater than the sahir's (Warping Score x 5);

The sahir returns with (Warping Score x 5) vis of a type appropriate to the experience, collected within his person or his belongings; Gain 3 Confidence Points.

**Spirit Points:** 3

**Effects:** Increase the sahir's Confidence

Score by 1;

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

Gain a +1 cumulative bonus to all social interactions (leading, teaching and bargaining, but not summoning or casting). While the effects of The Gift or similar Flaws are unchanged, the sahir becomes better at talking his way around them. The bonus does offset simple penalties to social rolls imposed by The Gift or Flaws, however. For example, a Gifted sahir with the normal Gift who takes this effect once has a –2 penalty to social rolls, but still suffers from the distrust and dislike inspired by The Gift; Gain a Minor Virtue appropriate to the experience, or remove a Minor Flaw.

Corruption Points have the following effects, also chosen by the storyguide:

#### **Corruption Points:** 1

**Effects:** Make an immediate Aging roll, adding the sahir's Warping Score to the total;

Suffer a Heavy wound;

Gain a bad Reputation among spirits from the appropriate realm at 2, or increase this Reputation by 1 if the sahir already has one.

#### **Corruption Points:** 3

**Effects:** Gain a –1 penalty to all social interactions, which is cumulative with the effects of The Gift and similar Flaws; Gain a Minor Flaw appropriate to the experience, or lose a Minor Virtue.

Other sahirs and spirits who are familiar with the sahir can usually tell, upon the character's return, whether the experience was positive or negative, though this otherworldly aspect fades quickly.

## *New Hermetic Virtues*

#### **Scientates Suleimanis**

*Major, Hermetic (Hermetic Breakthrough)*

This breakthrough Virtue allows a magus to invent and cast spells that use any of the non-Ritual Solomonic guidelines, using Rego with a Form appropriate to the target. This is similar to craft magic, where magi produce goods through magic labor. For example, a magus with this Virtue could use ReTe to duplicate the alchemical process by which a gem's quality is enhanced, or ReCo to encourage the body to recover fatigue more quickly.

#### **Hermetic Realm Initiation**

*Major, Hermetic (Hermetic Breakthrough)*

The magus may initiate students into Virtues in the same way sahirs do, by convincing a spirit to accompany the student into the Magic Realm. This uses the character's Rego Vim Lab Total instead of Solomonic Travel, and substitutes Magic Theory for Magic Lore, but otherwise works the same way: costing vis, reducing the spirit's Might Score, and Warping the student.

## *Integration*

There is always the possibility that peaceful voices will prevail, and that magi and sahirs will work together to combine their magic into a unified tradition. Or perhaps one of them will learn enough about the other to steal their magical secrets and gain the upper hand. Here are some examples of discoveries that might be achieved in either case.

# *New Solomonic Virtues*

#### **Spontaneous Solomonic Spells**

*Major, Supernatural (Major Breakthrough)* The sahir possessing this Breakthrough Virtue can cast formulaic spells spontaneously, the same way as magi do. To do this he must either lose a Fatigue level and divide his Casting Total by 2, or not roll the stress die and divide his Casting Total by 5.

#### **Independent Solomonic Magic**

*Major, Supernatural (Solomonic Breakthrough)*

The sahir can cast and maintain Solomonic spells without channeling them through a spirit. This does not add his Summoning Strength to his Casting Total, and uses his Penetration Total instead of the spirit's. If he is unGifted, his independent spells and effects cast this way have no maximum level.

#### **Hermetic True Names**

*Minor Breakthrough*

Experimenting with True Names and Solomonic summoning spells has led the magus to the discovery of means to incorporate an Arcane Connection into a formulaic spell, making it a permanent component of that spell. From then on, the magus no longer needs the physical object to affect that target or location or to invent new spells that target it through an Arcane Connection, and gains the bonus for a permanent Arcane Connection to his Penetration multiplier whenever he casts it. The new spell and associated Arcane Connection can then


be taught or written into a lab text for others to invent.

#### **Scientates Suleimanis**

*Hermetic Breakthrough*

By studying the Solomonic arts and the Abilities associated with them, the magus gains Insight into the way Solomonic magic allows sahirs to duplicate natural effects associated with science, emotions, and the supernatural realms. The magus then invents experimental Rego spells that produce similar effects. Once the breakthrough is achieved and the associated Virtue distributed, magi will be able to duplicate any Solomonic formulaic spell, including those overcoming the Limit of Energy.

#### **Hermetic Realm Initiation**

*Hermetic Breakthrough*

After undergoing the initiation himself, instead of gaining a Solomonic art, the magus gains Insight into the Solomonic initiation process. This might produce a spell to warp another person with magic, or a ritual to open him to a Virtue possessed by the caster. This research eventually leads to a breakthrough with which the magus may initiate others into new Supernatural or Hermetic Virtues without the secrecy and lore of a Mystery Cult. Soon powerful magi may even learn to teach Hermetic magic to the unGifted, by initiating them into each Art.

#### **Solomonic Devices**

*Minor Breakthrough*

The sahir must study enchanted items made with Hermetic magic, which gives him Insight towards bindings made with similar effects. Through experimentation, he learns to build devices that do not require a spirit, but maintain concentration on their own. This discovery likely leads to a great wealth of invested items throughout the Mythic Middle East and beyond, as sahirs would be free to create items with lasting effects without having to bind spirits to them.


#### **Spontaneous Solomonic Spells**

*Major Breakthrough*

Sahirs would greatly benefit from the ability to cast spells they have not memorized. Studying Magic Theory provides Insight into this practice, perhaps yielding formulaic spells for which the sahir can change the parameters as he casts them. The Major Virtue this project produces would allow sahirs to cast spontaneous spells in the same way as magi, dividing their Casting Total by 2 or by 5. Because sahirs would need less time in their laboratories inventing new spells, this discovery could lessen the importance of buyut alhikma throughout the Suhhar, as more sahirs might prefer seeking out more spirits or other adventuring activities during their free seasons to learning new spells.

#### **Independent Solomonic Magic**

*Solomonic Breakthrough*

By studying Hermetic magic, a sahir could remove his need to channel a spirit's power. This requires him to initiate at least one Hermetic Technique and one Hermetic Form and study Magic Theory, but the Insights produced from these sources lead to spells that could be cast independently of a summoned spirit, with the sahir maintaining the effects and using the sahir's Penetration Total. This would be especially valuable for unGifted sahirs, as their spirits' Might Scores would no longer limit their magic with these spells.

# *Solomonic Arts*

The Art of Solomon, through its component arts, has a wide range of effects described by the guidelines in this section, with sample spells to demonstrate how these effects might be used. Players may safely assume that every listed guideline has been developed into a naranj at one time or another.


Most of the guidelines use magic to duplicate the natural results of practicing medieval science, and thus have a momentary and permanent duration. However, some effects require ritual spells because their effects cannot be reproduced with mundane abilities and, like all rituals spells, have temporary effects that last only as long as they are maintained.

The sample spells sometimes reference a spirit by name (written as "[Spirit]"), but this is generally not exclusive. Unless the sahir has an appropriate Flaw, any spirit he summons may power any spell he casts.

## *Sihr*

Sahirs use Sihr to summon jinn, and to provide mystic force behind the bargain that places a jinni into their service. Strictly speaking, Sihr is not a Solomonic art, but is so common among sahirs that many Ashab al-Halqa ("Followers of the Circle," the sixth sahir "family") consider it the special power of their lineage. In some texts the Seal of Solomon is drawn with six points — this is seen as an attempt by these sahirs to spread the idea that Sihr is just as integral to Solomonic magic as the other families' powers.

Sihr is said to originate from the legendary Art of Solomon, and is sometimes referred to as Solomonic Sihr, or (Solomonic) Summoning. It is very similar to the Sihr that is still practiced in Iberia, though the two traditions split almost two hundred years ago. Solomonic Sihr is slightly more compatible with Solomonic magic, though sahirs can use either version.

#### **Discerning Jinn**

Before a jinni is summoned, the sahir should study it to determine its strength. If the sahir can see spirits (with Second Sight, for example), then he can directly observe the jinni in its native habitat, and it takes him just a single round to make the necessary assessment. Without magical help, the sahir must use his knowledge of the local area to gather sufficient information about the spirit who dwells there; the player should make an Intelligence + (Area) Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to discover the Form that the jinni takes and its likely powers. It takes about an hour for the sahir to make this assessment.

Once this preliminary research has been performed, the sahir can attempt to discern the jinni's approximate Might, based on its appearance (if seen), its abode, and the sahir's own knowledge. He must decide whether the jinni is Faerie, Magic or Infernal (based on its behavior and attitude), and make an Intelligence roll modified by the appropriate (Realm) Lore. Success reveals the magnitude of the jinni's Might. Failure indicates the sahir is unable to guess, making summoning it more dangerous. The decision as to which (Realm) Lore to use is vital; if the player guesses wrongly, then this is a straight Intelligence roll. Since the player has no experience with jinn, the storyguide should make the distinction clear.

**Discern Might: Intelligence + (Realm) Lore + stress die against Ease Factor of 9**

#### **Summoning Jinn**

Once discerned, the sahir may summon the jinni and attempt to bind it into service. This summons requires the jinni to be within range of the sahir's voice, or else he needs an Arcane Connection. The summons takes at least 15 minutes to perform, during which the sahir chants words of command, makes prescribed gestures, and draws symbols on the ground.

The summons generally includes an offering of vis, one pawn of a type appropriate to the jinni's form for every magnitude of the jinni's Might Score, but the sahir can offer more (a maximum equal to the character's Sihr score) or less (none, even). The sahir only has his own rough estimate of the jinni's Might, so he may unwittingly offer more or less than the standard amount. This offering does not affect the Summoning Total, but it plays an important role in the bargaining which follows.

The sahir then generates a Summoning Total based on his Sihr score. A successful summons that also penetrates the jinni's Magic Resistance forces it to take a physical form before the sahir. Calculate the Summoning Strength, which is the amount by which the sahir's Casting Total exceeds the Ease Factor. A botched roll results in an infuriated jinni, or perhaps a spirit different than the one intended.

**Summoning Total: Presence + Sihr + aura + stress die**

> **Ease Factor: jinni's Might Score**

**Summoning Penetration: Summoning Total + sahir's Penetration Bonus – jinni's Might Score**

**Summoning Strength: Summoning Total – jinni's Might Score**

A failed summons has no effect, though the sahir can try again at the cost of a Fatigue level.

The sahir can spend extra time on a summons; each additional 15 minutes causes him to lose a long-term Fatigue level and adds another botch die to the Summoning roll, but provides a +5 bonus to his Penetration Total. He can also spend vis, each pawn of the appropriate form giving him a +2 bonus to his Summoning Total, or a +1 bonus for each pawn of any other type.

#### **Bargaining with the Jinni**

After the jinni arrives, the sahir must bargain with it to gain its services. The power of Sihr ensures that the jinni cannot depart or attack until a bargain is struck or they have agreed no bargain can be achieved. A sahir who refuses to bargain releases the jinni from making a pact. "Bargain" may be misleading; a skilled sahir can obtain the services of a weak jinni without offering anything in return. The arrangement is magically enforced: the jinni cannot break the terms unless the sahir reneges first, and most jinn will obey the spirit of the agreement if treated well. A sahir can attempt to strike a bargain with



any jinn, not just those he has summoned — for example, renegotiation following the lapsing of a previous bargain — and Summoning Strength can give him an oftneeded advantage.

The Ease Factor has bargaining modifiers, which depend on what the sahir is asking from the jinni and what he offers. Aiding the sahir with his magic for a day is a single task, which reduces the Ease Factor by 6 (–3 for "Service to last one day" and –3 for "Terms constitute a single task").

A failed Bargaining Total results in a failure to make a bargain, and the jinni is not compelled to remain. A botch results in the sahir offending the jinni and temporarily acquiring either Supernatural Nui-

## *Non-Magic Sihr*

The description of Solomonic Sihr assumes that the power is aligned to the Magic realm, which is its most common form. However, versions of Sihr aligned to other realms have the following mechanical changes:

#### **Faerie Sihr**

The sahir adds the value of his highest good Reputation to his Bargaining Total, subtracts his highest bad Reputation, and does not apply any other negative Reputations to his Bargaining modifier. The storyguide rules whether a particular Reputation is good or bad. (Sympathy Traits and Faerie Rank also apply to this roll, if you are using the rules from *Realms of Power: Faerie*.)

#### **Divine Sihr**

Though the sahir has no foreign aura penalties to his Summoning Total, he cannot offer vis, which always increases the Ease Factor of the Bargaining Total by twice the magnitude of the jinni's Might Score.

#### **Infernal Sihr**

Failure on the Bargaining Total does not automatically permit the jinni to depart, and the sahir can hold it prisoner and continue to try and coerce it for as long as he likes, though each subsequent attempt costs him a Fatigue level. The storyguide should lower the Bargaining Total Ease Factor the longer the jinni is held captive: –1 after a day, –2 after a season, and –3 after a year.

## *Typical Duties for Sahirs*

The supernatural realm to which the jinni is aligned can greatly influence the duty that it sets the sahir. Infernal jinn typically demand sinful duties, while faerie jinn want human attention, and magic jinn desire power and wealth. (See Chapter 4: Jinn, for more details.)

#### **Small Duties**

These include cleansing or protecting the jinni's home, guarding a human family to which the jinni has become attached, retrieving stolen wealth, writing a poem in praise of the jinn, providing rare commodities such as frankincense or rubies, or obtaining vis from a particular source.

#### **Heavy Duties**

These include fighting wizards who seek to enslave jinn, freeing slaves from captivity, playing a jest on an important local figure, delivering the heart of an enemy, traveling to a supernatural realm where the jinni cannot go, or procuring a unique item such as a book written in Solomon's own hand.

sance Flaw (for a weak jinni) or Plagued by Jinni (for a moderate or powerful jinni), which lasts for at least a month.

A successful bargain binds the jinni to the sahir for the duration. He can ask it to perform any task within its power, though the jinni cannot renege on any solemn oaths it has sworn prior to the summons and, for jinn who have adopted a religion, this includes disobeying the tenets of their faith. The jinni cannot make any new oaths without the sahir's permission while bound in service.

Any vis offered by the sahir during the summoning is part of the terms of the bargain and given to the jinni to use as it sees fit, and thus cannot be included in whatever task the sahir sets the jinni. A sahir



In the same way magi receive supernatural bonuses from their Form scores, sahirs have an innate form of "magical defense" from their Solomonic arts. Divide the sahir's score in each art by 5 to determine his Magical Defense Bonus, and see later for the specific applications of each art.

#### **Solomonic Alchemy**

From regular exposure to magic, the sahir's body is rarefied, making him stronger, better able to endure hardship, and more resistant to physical dangers. Add his bonus to Soak, subtract it from Aging rolls (this is cumulative with Solomonic Physic), and add it to Strength when calculating what he can carry without penalty.

#### **Solomonic Astrology**

Because of his heightened understanding of the heavenly signs and what they predict about the future, the sahir is more aware of events before they happen, and thus he is less likely to be surprised. Add his bonus to all of his Initiative rolls, and to his Perception rolls associated with alertness or with intuition. This also positively influences his experimentation in the laboratory.

may offer vis of a different type than the jinni's form, but it is less compelling. For example, when summoning a jinni with 10 Might (Imaginem), a sahir who offers two pawns of vis will have his bargain modifier reduced by 4. If that vis is not Imaginem vis, his bargain modifier is then increased by 2.

Note that sahirs with The Gift typically suffer a penalty to all social interactions, which affects this total. (Unlike the Parma Magica, Magic Resistance does not protect supernatural beings against the negative aura of those with The Gift, though some magical beings are immune to the effects.)

#### **Solomonic Physic**

The sahir with knowledge of Solomonic Physic is generally healthier. Add his bonus to his Recovery rolls and subtract it from Aging rolls (this is cumulative with Solomonic Alchemy). In addition, he becomes less noticeable: add his bonus to rolls that involve being stealthy or unobtrusive, including his Defense when he is not attacking.

#### **Solomonic Storytelling**

The sahir's presence is enhanced, giving him the bonus to rolls for non-magical social activities (cumulative with the bonus from Fatra Bayna) and increasing his Leadership score when commanding spirits or managing a laboratory. Also, he is more resistant to powers that target emotions; add his bonus to any rolls involving his Personality Traits.

#### **Solomonic Travel**

Exposure to the supernatural allows the sahir to add his bonus to otherworldly navigation rolls, and add or subtract it from his Fatra Bayna Avoidance rolls. He may also add this bonus to Stamina rolls to avoid fatigue, and to his Concentration and Finesse rolls when controlling his magic or resisting supernatural influences.

A sahir can only bind a limited number of jinn in service to him at a time, equal to his Leadership score plus one — even a sahir with no Leadership score can command at least one jinni.

#### **Maximum Number of Bound Jinn: Leadership + 1**

Solomonic Sihr is the most common summoning art in the Mythic Middle East. It is usually aligned with the Magic realm, though there are Divine, Faerie, and Infernal versions, each with slight functional differences (see the Non-Magic Sihr sidebar).

## *Solomonic Alchemy*

Solomonic Alchemy affects non-living matter, simple (water, air, fire, earth) or complex (i.e., metal, smoke, bone, wood). The sahir or the spirit must touch the target, and can affect up to one cubic pace of simple matter or 50 cubic inches of complex matter. Each additional magnitude added to the spell level multiplies the amount of matter he can target by 10.

These effects have one parameter, Alteration, which determines the magnitude of natural change that the sahir can impose upon the matter. Thus, making dirt as sticky as clay is less difficult than making it as sticky as mercury.

**Slight:** The matter undergoes a subtle change in appearance or property, within the common range of examples for that matter. For example, give water the scent of the sea, or change the color of a standard gemstone. (+0 magnitudes)

**Minor:** The matter undergoes a noticeable change in appearance or property. The change must be commonly found in nature, and of a general sort. For example, brighten moonlight to that of a torch, or condense air into a cloud. A Minor change can increase or decrease Size by one category. (+1 magnitude)

**Substantial:** The matter undergoes a significant change in appearance or property, uncommon in nature. For example, make water as caustic as acid, or iron as flexible as copper. A Substantial change can increase or decrease Size by two categories. (+2 magnitudes)

**Major:** The matter undergoes a total change in appearance or property, but no more than the extremes found in nature. For example, call lightning from a clear sky, or make stone as hard as diamond. A Major change can increase or decrease Size by three categories. (+3 magnitudes)

When performing Solomonic Alchemy through a mundane activity using Philosophiae, the sahir must apply various reagents, powders, tinctures, or other ingredients to the target. These are typically



provided by an apothecary, and many sahirs make their living collecting and selling such materials.

See *Art and Academe* for more examples of alchemical effects.

#### **Solomonic Alchemy Spell Formulas**

The spells given here are specially designed for Solomonic Alchemy.

#### **Sanctuary in the sand**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 5 Alteration: Minor

This spell instantly purifies the area immediately surrounding the sahir (10 cubic paces), making stale air easier to breathe and removing choking dust or smoke.

(Base 3, +1 Minor, +1 size)

#### **[Spirit]'s oasis**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 5 Alteration: Slight, Ritual

The sahir mixes a pawn of vis and a cubic pace of sand, and changes it into a pool of clear spring water, enough to fill several large barrels. This transformation only lasts as long as the spirit maintains the effect, though the ritual nature of the spell ensures that the water will still quench thirst if drunk before it changes back. Note, however, that characters with Magic Resistance cannot swallow this water unless the effect penetrates their defenses.

(This is a Slight change, because the water produced is perfectly natural, and quite commonly found in this form.)

(Base 5)

#### **Cracks in the earth, [Spirit] weakens the ground**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 10 Alteration: Substantial

With this spell, the sahir diminishes the cold, cohesive property of earth, causing a single rock or a circle of stone three feet in diameter to crumble into chunks of dirt and dust.

(Base 4, +2 Substantial)

#### **Summon forth the purest flame, to set alight those who oppose us**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 15

Alteration: Major

The sahir takes a barely inflammable object like a damp cloth or a piece of wood coated with pitch, and lights the end of it. This spell changes the fire into a bright blue flame that burns hotter than even molten iron. This flame lasts until it runs out of fuel, can ignite things like flesh or wet thatch that are otherwise extremely resistant to fire, and causes +20 Damage to anyone that comes into direct contact with it.

(Base 4, +3 Major)

#### **The wind is my armor, my armor is the wind**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 15 Alteration: Slight, Ritual When preparing for a long journey, the sahir casts this spell upon his mail hauberk. This costs three pawns of vis and transforms the heavy, worked metal into light, spun threads of cloth for the duration of the effect. The sahir typically instructs his spirit to drop the effect just before he goes into battle, which also frees the spirit to focus on other spells while the sahir is fighting.

Since the Alteration parameter is Slight, the cloth that this spell produces is somewhat fragile and looks like woven chain links, but can be worn beneath a traveling cloak or gown. Increasing Alteration to Minor lets the sahir change the cut and look of the armor into something more fashionable, and Substantial allows him to change it into a completely different sort of garment. Another common variation is to add a magnitude of size to affect the barding on his horse.

Magos al-Laqis al-Abyad al-Sakhr uses this spell in an interesting way: before he

## *Solomonic Alchemy Guidelines*

These guidelines distinguish between changes to principle qualities (hot, cold, dry, or moist) and secondary qualities (things like acidity, density, weight, or color) of matter.

Ritual alchemy effects can be held dormant until the sahir or the spirit triggers them by concentrating upon them, for as long as the spirit maintains the effect, and may be transferred from one appropriate target to another as long as the effect is still active and the new target is touching the former target, the sahir, or the spirit (Finesse rolls are required if the new target is not clearly part of the original target). Animated objects will move under the sahir's control if he concentrates upon them, but he must make Finesse rolls for more focused manipulation.

Unlike basic Alchemy spells that bring about natural changes to the substance of the target, spells that use ritual guidelines produce a magical substance that for the duration cannot directly affect anyone with Magic Resistance unless the spell Penetrates.

**Level 3:** Enhance or diminish a secondary quality of simple matter. Purify simple matter.

**Level 4:** Enhance or diminish a principle quality of simple matter.

**Level 5:** Enhance or diminish a secondary quality of complex matter. Purify complex matter.

Transform simple matter into another kind of simple matter for the duration of the effect. (Ritual) Increase or decrease the size of matter for the duration of the effect. (Ritual)

**Level 10:** Enhance or diminish a principle quality of complex matter. Animate simple matter for the duration of the effect. (Ritual) Transform simple or complex matter into another kind of simple or complex matter for the duration of the effect. (Ritual)

**Level 15:** Animate complex matter for the duration of the effect. (Ritual) Transform matter for the duration of the effect, adding or removing properties like weight or temperature with the Alteration parameter. (Ritual)


enters battle, he sends forth his guardian angel to touch the armor of one of his unsuspecting opponents, and then (with a successful Finesse roll) he transfers the effect to his armor instead, restoring his own protection and leaving his enemy suddenly vulnerable.

(Base 10, +1 size)

#### **Bear me upon breath of stone**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 20 Alteration: Minor, Ritual

The sahir lights a bonfire that produces a great deal of smoke, and after he sacrifices the necessary pawns of vis, the gray clouds become as solid as stone, able to support the weight of a man. The sahir may then step onto these unnatural floes and rise into the air, or perhaps climb down them if he moves quickly, as long as the spirit maintains the spell and the fire continues to produce smoke.

(This is a "noticeable" transformation, altering the ability of the smoke to bear weight to correspond to that of stone. A Substantial alteration might alter several properties of the smoke at once, perhaps making a cloud cohesive and enduring enough to support a structure, or cause the smoke to become cold and slippery as well as solid.)

(Base 15, +1 Minor)

#### **What Jabir found inside the rock**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 20 Alteration: Major

This spell improves the quality of a precious or semi-precious gem, dramatically increasing its value. In addition, the Shape and Material bonus that the stone imparts when used with Hermetic magic increases by 3. For example, an emerald purified by this spell would give a +10 bonus to magic that affects snakes and dragonkind, instead of a +7 bonus. Any given stone can only be affected once with this effect; it is impossible to naturally purify it further.

Sahirs are not supposed to trade "magic things" to people who do not belong to the Suhhar, but the exchange of gemstones that have been enhanced with this spell has so far gone unnoticed at Majlis. Perhaps this is because those of the Ashab al-Qalb who use it do so sparingly enough that it has not come to the attention of the viziers, or perhaps it is because enchantment bonus does not benefit the sahirs' magic in any way, and thus they do not realize why magi especially value these stones.

(Base 5, +3 Major)

#### **Rain of heavenly fire**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 30 Alteration: Substantial, Ritual

The sahir casts the spell while his casting spirit is close enough to see and hear him, and since it is a ritual he can then hold it dormant while the spirit flies into a thunderstorm. Then, through the spirit, he transforms the rain into searing bolts of flame that cause +10 Damage to anyone caught beneath them without Magic Resistance. This rain is hot enough to ignite buildings, trees, and other things made of wood, and these new fires are not extinguished when the effect ends. The storm will continue to rain fire for as long as the spirit concentrates, or until the storm naturally abates.

Members of the Suhhar can usually recognize this spell by the way it leaves behind soaking wet rubble when the flames transform back into rain.

(Base 5, +2 Substantial, +3 size)

#### **The vigilant guardian**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 30 Alteration: Major, Ritual

With this spell, the sahir animates a stone statue of up to 10 cubic feet in size (roughly the size of a very large man), which follows his directions whenever he concentrates, for as long as the spirit maintains the effect. The statue can slowly move and bend its limbs as if they were made of clay, though they remain as hard and impenetrable as stone. It can even change its shape, flowing like mud or sand to spread out across a surface, though it will naturally attempt to return to its original form whenever the sahir releases control of it or when the spell ends. (These changes are Major alterations.)

(Base 10, +3 Major, +1 size)

#### **The wondrous box of Al-Fazari**

Solomonic Alchemy Level 35 Alteration: Minor, Ritual

The sahir touches an object that is about 50,000 cubic inches in size, such as a large chest or basket, and spends seven pawns of vis. The object and everything it contains grows or shrinks by a factor of ten (the equivalent of three Size categories), and remains that size for as long as the spirit maintains the effect. An animal of Size 0 placed inside the box could grow to Size +3 (the size of a very large horse), or shrink to become Size –3 (the size of a cat).

(Base 5, +3 Major, +3 size)

## *Solomonic Astrology*

Astrological effects impart information directly to the sahir through his recognition of signs and portents, and can thus target any individual the sahir can see or to which he has an Arcane Connection. These effects have a single parameter, Detail, which describes the quality of information gleaned from the spell, though questions about the past or the distant future add an additional magnitude, and those about the near future (within a month) add two magnitudes.

Some ritual spell effects give the sahir the ability to sense danger, similar to the Premonitions Supernatural Ability. When this effect is active, the storyguide should apply a Premonition bonus to any roll where the outcome would make the prediction false, and reduce the number of botch dice for these rolls by the same amount. The base value of this bonus is noted next to the corresponding guideline, and increases with the Detail parameter, as indicated later.

**Binary:** A one-word answer between two choices. (+0 magnitudes)

**Basic:** The equivalent of a three-word answer. This adds a +1 bonus to premonition effects. (+1 magnitude)

**Brief:** A single sentence of information. This adds a +2 bonus to premonition effects. (+2 magnitudes)

**Thorough:** All relevant information associated with the target. This adds a +3 bonus to premonition effects. (+3 magnitudes)


Answers provided by Solomonic Astrology are not absolute, especially when they involve the future, though they do provide indicators that sahirs can interpret to receive clear answers to specific questions. For more guidance on the sorts of results that astrological calculations tend to provide, see *Art & Academe*, page 74.

When used with Artes Liberales to disguise or augment his casting, the sahir must make up an astrological chart for the target. This requires knowledge of the date and place of its birth, and an Intelligence + Artes Liberales roll against an Ease Factor of 9.

Solomonic Astrology General Detail: Basic, Ritual


The sahir consults the heavens regarding a particular course of action taken by his target, and calculates a date and approximate time during the next month in which the endeavor will be most likely to succeed, and the consequences least disastrous should he fail. At Level 30, this translates to a +1 bonus (and one fewer botch die) on any rolls associated with the activity, so long as that activity is performed at the appointed hour and day. This bonus increases with each additional magnitude, so at Level 35 it is a +2 bonus, +3 at Level 40, and so on.

Sahirs do not generally rely on this spell for spellcasting, since it is expensive in terms of vis and it is usually more cost-effective to spend the vis on the spell directly. For many non-magical activities or circumstances expected to be particularly danger-

## *Solomonic Astrology Guidelines*

All Solomonic Astrology ritual spells increase the Penetration of the sahir's magic by the effect level when casting subsequent spells against that same target, as long as the Solomonic Astrology ritual itself Penetrates. This bonus only lasts while the spirit maintains the effect, and requires the sahir to make a Finesse roll if he is casting the second spell through the same spirit.

**General:** Receive a premonition regarding auspicious influences for a particular action. The bonus the target receives is equal to (the magnitude of this effect – 3), and cannot be negative. (Ritual)

**Level 2:** Perceive one obvious property of a person or object (e.g., hair color, current activity).

**Level 3:** Perceive one property of a person or object that can be determined from close examination (e.g., state of consciousness, age).

**Level 4:** Perceive a specific piece of information about a person or object that cannot normally be determined without an appropriate Ability (e.g., emotional state, maker of an object). Perceive one obvious property of a person's or object's surroundings (e.g., time of day, sounds). (Ritual)

**Level 5:** Sense complex information about a person or object that would normally require extended use of an Ability (e.g., the truth of a statement, all mundane properties of an object). Perceive one property of a person's or object's surroundings that can be determined from close examination (e.g., climate, prosperity level). (Ritual) Receive a premonition regarding mortal peril to a person or object (+2 bonus). (Ritual)

Create a temporary Arcane Connection to the target, with connection strength equal to (the magnitude of the Detail parameter + 1). (Ritual)

**Level 10:** Perceive a specific piece of information about a person's or object's surroundings that cannot normally be determined without an appropriate Ability (e.g., a companion's health, a supernatural aura). (Ritual)

Receive a premonition regarding danger to a person or object (+1 bonus). (Ritual)

**Level 15:** Perceive complex information about a person's or object's surroundings that would normally require extended use of an Ability (e.g., all nearby animals, what others think of that person) (Ritual)

Receive a premonition regarding an inconvenience to a person or object (+0 bonus). (Ritual)


ous, however, the preparation of this spell is considered to be exceptionally wise, and its judicious application is highly favored by the members of the Ashab al-Najm.

#### **The picture of [Target]**

Solomonic Astrology Level 5 Detail: Binary, Ritual

This spell creates a temporary Arcane Connection between an object held by the caster and the target, which costs a single pawn of vis and only lasts as long as the spirit maintains the effect. This Arcane Connection is equivalent in strength to one that lasts hours or days (giving a +1 bonus to the Penetration multiplier), and as a side effect of casting a ritual spell, for the duration this naranj also gives the sahir a +5 bonus to his Penetration Total for subsequent spells cast at that target.

When the duration of the effect ends, the Arcane Connection immediately fades. Until then, it is a normal and natural Arcane Connection, and thus it can be made permanent in the laboratory with a season of effort and a pawn of vis.

(Base 5)

#### **What is the state of [Target]'s health?**

Solomonic Astrology Level 5

Detail: Brief

This spell tells the sahir whether the target inclines more towards life or death, and in what way, through a short sentence. For example, "He is alive, very badly burned, disfigured, unconscious, and incapacitated."

If the target has Magic Resistance, this effect must Penetrate to provide an answer. Many sahirs cast low-level Astrology naranjs like this one as ritual spells for the bonus to their Penetration Total. For this spell, this costs the sahir a pawn of vis and gives him a +5 bonus to subsequent spells cast on that target.

(Base 3, +2 Brief)

#### **Is [Target] a spirit?**

Solomonic Astrology Level 10 Detail: Brief

This spell tells the sahir if his target is

a spirit or not, and if so, what type of spirit and approximately how powerful it is (e.g., "a weak faerie spirit, with less than 10 Faerie Might" or "a powerful spirit with Magic Might 30 or more"). Note that if the spirit is Infernal, this spell typically gives a false reading. Since an object with a spirit bound to it is an Arcane Connection to that spirit, this spell can effectively tell the sahir if a given object is a Solomonic device.

(Base 4, +2 Brief)

#### **Where is [Target] at this moment?**

Solomonic Astrology Level 10 Detail: Brief

The sahir concentrates upon his question (and perhaps draws a horoscope for the target, adding half an hour to the casting time and his Artes Liberales to the Casting Total), and learns the target's current location, within a describable region and in relation to a particular feature, such as "south of the city of Baghdad, within an ancient stone structure." This should be information that a person familiar with the surrounding area could recognize based on landmarks, local legends, and the like.

(Base 4, +2 Brief)

#### **What are the words that surround [Target]?**

Solomonic Astrology Level 15 Detail: Thorough, Ritual

The sahir concentrates upon his target, and for as long as his spirit keeps the effect active, he can hear all sounds in the target's presence. The sahir is not actually there, of course, so he is not affected by magic that targets those in the area, which makes this effect ideal for intelligence gathering.

(Base 4, +3 Thorough)

#### **Hearing the heart's speech**

Solomonic Astrology Level 20

Detail: Thorough

By reading all of the auspices surrounding his target's circumstances, the sahir can understand fully what his target is expressing, allowing him to make sense of words that are otherwise unfamiliar for a single exchange. If cast as a ritual spell with four pawns of vis, the duration can be extended indefinitely, allowing the sahir to comprehend his target's speech for as long as the spirit maintains the effect. If the target has Magic Resistance, the spell fails unless the sahir Penetrates it.

There is a fairly common version of this spell invented by a sahir named Dawud al-Malik al-Najm that, as a side effect of experimentation, also includes the target's understanding of any words spoken by the sahir. This variation can be found throughout the Suhhar but requires at least rudimentary knowledge of Solomonic Storytelling to learn.

(Base 5, +3 Thorough)

#### **What do [Target]'s enemies intend?**

Solomonic Astrology Level 25 Detail: Brief, Ritual

This ritual spell costs five pawns of vis and gives the sahir a premonition about any sort of social danger to his target, related to an immediate situation such as Majlis or a meeting with an important person. The storyguide decides if and how the target will be inconvenienced at the event, and answers with a short sentence to describe the circumstances. For example, "a rival intends to challenge you to a storytelling duel." This also gives the player a +2 bonus towards all actions that support the accuracy of the premonition; that is, those rolls to affect whether he is inconvenienced or not. In this example, the sahir would likely gain the bonus to rolls during the duel and actions leading up to the duel, but not to rolls where he attempts to avoid the duel or where he tries to deal with his enemy in other ways.

(Base 15, +2 Brief)

#### **When and where was [Target] born?**

Solomonic Astrology Level 25

Detail: Thorough

When the sahir does not know the date or location of his target's birth, he may use this spell to divine it — though not, of course, while using Artes Liberales to boost the casting, since this is precisely the information he needs to draw the target's horoscope.

(Base 5, +3 Thorough, +1 past)



Solomonic Astrology Level 30 Detail: Thorough, Ritual

This spell gives the sahir a premonition concerning his target's chances against mortal peril in his near future. The storyguide considers the question, and then outlines the conditions for the sahir's player in general terms. For example, "He is not a skilled warrior but he wears good armor, so he is likely to prevail," or "He is too reckless, and if he charges into battle as he is usually wont to do, he will surely be killed."

Mechanically, this translates to a +5 bonus (+3 for Thorough, +2 for "mortal peril") to all rolls that would gainsay this outcome were they to fail (such as the target's Defense rolls in the first case, or his enemies' Attack rolls if he charges into battle in the second case).

(Base 5, +3 Thorough, +2 near future)

## *Solomonic Physic*

To affect a target with Solomonic Physic, the sahir or the spirit must touch it during the round he casts the naranj. He can affect animals as easily as humans, though they do require separate spells, and as long as a naranj targets an individual person or creature, its size does not matter; a giant or dwarf can be affected as easily as a normal man.

Physic effects have one parameter, Potency, which determines the strength of the effect. Many of these effects can injure as easily as heal.

**Weak:** Affect pain or other symptoms of injury or disease, minor aging crises, Winded Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or Personality Traits with scores of up to +1 or –1. (+0 magnitudes)

**Mild:** Affect Light Wounds, Minor Diseases, serious aging crises, Weary Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or Personality Traits with scores of up to +2 or –2. (+1 magnitude)

**Moderate:** Affect Medium Wounds, Serious Diseases, major aging crises, Tired Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or Personality Traits with scores of up to +3 or –3. (+2 magnitudes)

## *Solomonic Physic Guidelines*

All active Solomonic Physic ritual spells also either protect the patient against the penalties for that particular type of wound, disease, or level of fatigue; or they prevent that wound, disease or fatigue from healing, for as long as the spirit maintains the effect.

Also, for the duration, ritual spells may be delayed like with Solomonic Alchemy: they can be held dormant until the sahir or the spirit releases them by touching the target.

**General:** Modify the target's next Wound Recovery roll by (3 x (the effect's magnitude + 2)). Use this general guideline for effects Base Level 5 or greater.

Modify the target's next Disease Recovery roll by (3 x (the effect's magnitude + 2)) against diseases of a certain humor. Use this general guideline for effects Base Level 5 or greater.

Cause a wound if the target fails a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of (3 x (the effect's magnitude + 2)). Use this general guideline for effects Base Level 5 or greater.

Increase or decrease a Personality Trait associated with one of the four humors by a number of points equal to (the magnitude of this effect + 1), up to the maximum established by the Potency parameter. (Ritual)

Increase one of a person's Characteristics for the effect's duration by a number of points equal to (the magnitude of this effect – 3), up to the maximum established by the Potency parameter. (Ritual)

Decrease one of a person's Characteristics for the effect's duration by a number of points equal to (the magnitude of this effect – 3), up to the maximum established by the Potency parameter. (Ritual)

**Level 2:** Modify the target's next Wound Recovery roll by 1.

Modify the target's next Disease Recovery roll against diseases of a certain humor by 1.

Cause a wound if the target fails a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 0.

**Level 3:** Modify the target's next Wound Recovery roll by 3.

Modify the target's next Disease Recovery roll against diseases of a certain humor by 3.

Cause a wound if the patient fails a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 3.

Reduce or increase the potency of poison by one step.

**Level 4:** Modify the target's next Wound Recovery roll by 6.

Modify the target's next Disease Recovery roll against diseases of a certain humor by 6.

Cause a wound if the patient fails a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 6.

**Level 5:** Cure a specific disease in the normal recovery interval.

Restore a fatigue level.

Cause the loss of a fatigue level.

Restore a long-term fatigue level. (Ritual)

Cause the loss of a long-term fatigue level. (Ritual)

Instantly cure a specific disease. (Ritual)

Infect the target with a specific disease. (Ritual)

Transform a Personality Trait into a different Trait for the duration. (Ritual)

**Level 10:** Heal a wound from a specific source (poison, crushing damage, piercing damage) over the course of the wound's normal recovery interval.

Instantly heal a wound from a specific source (piercing damage, crushing damage, poison). (Ritual)

Cause a wound. (Ritual)

Instantly cure any disease. (Ritual)

**Level 15:** Instantly heal a wound from any source. (Ritual)

**Level 20:** Resolve an aging crisis. (Ritual) Cause an aging crisis. (Ritual)


**Strong:** Affect Heavy Wounds, Major Diseases, critical aging crises, Dazed Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or Personality Traits with scores of up to +4 or –4. (+3 magnitudes)

**Mighty:** Affect Incapacitating Wounds, Critical Diseases, terminal aging crises, Unconscious Fatigue levels, or Characteristics or Personality Traits with scores of up to +5 or –5. (+4 magnitudes)

For effects that grant either a bonus or a penalty, the choice is made during casting; the naranj as designed can do both. Since many of these effects involve a bonus or penalty to the target's next Recovery roll, it may be possible to recognize how the patient is doing before then.

When disguising or supplementing his magic with Medicine, the sahir must administer herbs and other ingredients typically supplied by an apothecary, much like sahirs performing Solomonic Alchemy. With no access to these materials, the sahir must always use arcane gestures and words.

Additional examples of medicinal effects that sahirs can duplicate with magic may be found in *Art and Academe*.

#### **Solomonic Physic Spell Formulas**

The spells given here are specially designed for Solomonic Physic.

#### **Balm of the barmakids**

Solomonic Physic General Potency: Mild

The target receives a bonus (or penalty) to his next Recovery roll for a Light Wound, which varies depending on the base level of this effect. At Level 5 this modifies the roll by 6, at Level 10 the modifier is 9, and at Level 15 the bonus or penalty is 12.

(Base effect, +1 Mild)

#### **Strings of the sanguine heart**

Solomonic Physic General Potency: Moderate, Ritual

This ritual affects the blood of the target, altering the sanguine humors and influencing the target's behavior. For the duration of the effect, the target has his Sanguine Personality Trait increased or decreased by the magnitude of this spell – 1, to a maximum value of +3 or –3. At Level 20, this is a change of three points. If the target does not have a Sanguine Trait or a similar Trait such as Carefree or Optimistic, he gains one for the duration of the effect.

When casting this spell while incorporating principles of Medicine, the sahir typically feeds the target red meat or strong wine fortified with animal blood before performing the ritual.

(Base effect, +2 Moderate)

#### **Rend his flesh and tear his organs**

Solomonic Physic General

Potency: Moderate

The target is poisoned internally and suffers a medium wound unless he makes a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 0 for a Level 4 spell, or three times the magnitude of the spell for Level 5 or more. For example, at Level 20, the Ease Factor is 12.

If cast as a ritual spell, the effect can be held dormant by the spirit and released at an ideal time, and unless the target resists it, he cannot heal this wound naturally for as long as the spirit maintains concentration.

(Base effect, +2 Moderate)

#### **[Spirit] sits on the fever's edge**

Solomonic Physic General Potency: Strong

This spell helps or hinders the target's recovery from a major disease or lesser severity that affects the blood. It modifies his Recovery roll by 1 for a Level 5 spell, 3 for a Level 10 spell, or (3 x (the magnitude of the spell – 1)) for a spell Level 15 or more. For example, a Level 15 spell would add or subtract 6.

Magos al-Laqis al-Abyad al-Sakhr causes his patient to briefly feel completely at peace whenever he casts this spell through his guardian angel.

(Base effect, +3 Strong)

#### **Insight of the ancient jinn**

Solomonic Physic, General Potency: Weak, Ritual

The target's Perception temporar-

ily increases by a number of points equal to (the magnitude of this effect – 3), up to a maximum score of +1, and he cannot have his Perception reduced by other spells. This effect only lasts as long as the spirit maintains it. At Level 20, this increases Perception 0 to Perception +1, and at Level 35 this increases Perception –3 to +1.

(Base effect)

#### **The hollowing curse**

Solomonic Physic, General Potency: Mighty, Ritual

The target of this devastating spell has his Stamina reduced by (its magnitude – 7), to a minimum of –5, for the duration of the effect. For example, at Level 60, a target with Stamina +1 will be temporarily reduced five points to Stamina –4. Furthermore, the target cannot increase his Stamina through any means during this time, even through Al-Iksir potions or other Solomonic Physic rituals, and gains a Warping Point every season it is active plus an additional Warping Point when it is cast.

It is said that the Ashab al-Yad prefer not to murder their enemies (all sahirs are still answerable to their earthly authorities, after all), but instead punish them in other ways, such as with this spell, which makes the target especially vulnerable to accidents and illnesses. Also, unlike death, this effect can be undone, if necessary.

(Base effect, +4 Mighty)

#### **Siphoning the warrior's bile**

Solomonic Physic Level 15 Potency: Moderate, Ritual

By touching his target and spending three pawns of vis, the sahir casts a spell that transforms the target's Brave Trait into a different Trait for the spell's duration, chosen when this spell is cast. The spell can affect similar Traits like Courageous, or opposing Traits like Cowardly, but only Traits with scores of up to +3 or –3 may be affected. The new Trait should be similarly positive or negative, e.g., Brave to Loyal or Kind, Cowardly to Prideful or Envious.

(Base 5, +2 Moderate)



Solomonic Physic Level 25 Potency: Mighty

The sahir restores a Fatigue Level to his target, even when unconscious. If cast as a ritual spell, the target suffers no penalty for lost fatigue for as long as the spirit maintains the effect, though the target can still fall unconscious from exhaustion.

Many sahirs cast this on themselves as a ritual spell, instructing the spirit to hold the effect dormant until they pass out, to revive themselves as quickly as possible.

(Base 5, +4 Mighty)

#### **Close the red wounds of war**

Solomonic Physic Level 30

Potency: Mighty, Ritual

This spell immediately heals any one Incapacitating, Heavy, Medium, or Light Wound caused by damage that cuts or pierces the body. The spell takes about an hour and a half to cast, and requires six pawns of vis. It also gives the target a Warping Point for a powerful mystical effect unless it has been specifically designed for him.

Because it is a ritual spell, for as long as the spirit maintains the effect, the penalty from all other wounds the patient sustains is reduced by 7.

(Base 10, +4 Mighty)

#### **Jabril's blessing**

Solomonic Physic Level 40 Potency: Mighty, Ritual

This spell immediately resolves any illness caused by an aging crisis. The patient will fully recover after about a season, though for as long as the spirit maintains the effect, the patient suffers no ill effects from the crisis and may continue as normal.

(Base 20, +4 Mighty)

## *Solomonic Storytelling*

Solomonic Storytelling spells affect "an audience," which is essentially any and all targets within range of the sahir's voice. As with Hermetic magic, the sahir must be able to perceive everyone targeted by the naranj at the time of casting in order to affect them, though some ritual spells create illusions that can affect anyone who comes upon them after they have been cast.

Those who are targeted by Storytelling effects have a chance to see through them, and so they have an Allure parameter that determines how difficult they are to resist. Also, Solomonic Storytelling does not circumvent Magic Resistance, so when characters with Magic Resistance are targeted, the storyguide should check for Penetration first.

**Simple:** The target sees through the effect with a Perception + Awareness against an Ease Factor of 6, made when the subject first encounters the effect. (+0 magnitudes)

**Emotional:** The target resists the effect with a Perception die roll plus or minus a Personality Trait that suggests whether or not he would question the effect, against an Ease Factor of 6. For example, Brave and Loyal would probably subtract from the die roll. (+1 magnitudes)

**Unsuspecting:** An intelligent target may see through the effect if his suspicions are raised. Once the target is skeptical, this is a Perception + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist. (+2 magnitudes)

**Supernatural:** Only targets with supernatural perception, such as Second Sight or Solomonic Travel ritual spells, may see through the effect. The Perception + (Ability) roll has an Ease Factor of 6. (+3 magnitudes)

Storytelling effects are always susceptible to the parameters with higher magnitude as well as the value they are designed to use, so that a suspicious person with Second Sight would have three chances to see through an effect with Emotional Allure. While designing the spell, the sahir may also add a magnitude to the spell level to increase the Ease Factor for any of these Perception checks by 3. For example, three additional magnitudes would increase all four Ease Factors from 6 to 15.

When disguising or augmenting a Storytelling spell using (Area) Lore, the sahir must have an audience, and must hold this audience's attention, making a Communication + (Area) Lore roll. Here, (Area) Lore represents the sahir's ability to recall and relate an appropriate story. It also represents his ability to conjure images and emotions that match the local culture and his surroundings. The difficulty of this roll varies depending upon the audience and



the circumstances; Ease Factor 3 might be appropriate for a group relaxing around a fire, 15 for a hostile group blocking his way. At the players' discretion, Free Expression or similar Virtues give the character a +3 bonus on this roll.

Some Storytelling ritual spells produce what might be called "mental species." These affect the mind directly, creating illusions of perception that are solid and in all senses real for anyone who does not resist them. An illusion of flames is not actually hot, and an illusory ceiling does not actually keep out the weather, but the illusion masks outward signs so that those affected simply do not perceive them. A guest in an illusory house might become suspicious when he still has a chill after sitting by the fire, or when he feels rain falling despite the thick roof above him.

#### **The tongue has no bone, yet it crushes**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 5 Allure: Emotional

The sahir casts this naranj at his audience, causing those affected to feel profound embarrassment, as if they had just done something terribly improper. A humble person has a greater chance of seeing through this illusion, adding his Personality Trait score to the roll.

(Base 4, +1 Emotional)

#### **Wrathful breath of the desert wind**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 5 Allure: Simple, Ritual

The target's image is changed to appear as a skeleton, with all of his flesh removed, for as long as the spirit maintains the effect. This illusion may be pierced with a Perception roll against an Ease Factor of 6. Some members of the Suhhar this spell to punish sahirs who offend them in some way, making it even more difficult for their victims to interact with mundane society. It is common for the effect to manifest as a fierce wind blowing from the mouth of the sahir pronouncing the curse, stripping the meat from the target's frame.

(Base 5)

#### **Move along, move along**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 10

Allure: Simple

With this naranj, the sahir convinces a weak-minded audience to obey an innocuous suggestion, such as to allow him to pass by unmolested or to accept an unusual form of coin. The Perception + Awareness roll to see through the command is Ease Factor 15.

(Base 3, +3 Ease Factor)

#### **[Spirit], his arms wide**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 10 Allure: Simple

The sahir speaks, and those who listen understand a short message woven into his voice, even if they do not speak the same language. This message should be conveyed in a few words that describe a general concept, such as "a dragon

## *Solomonic Storytelling Guidelines*

All active Solomonic Storytelling ritual spells allow the sahir to provide additional direction by concentrating on the target, and selectively suppress or restore the effects on anyone affected by them, for as long as the spirit maintains the spell.

**Level 3:** Change an audience's dominant emotion into a similar emotion.

Convince an audience to follow an innocuous course of action ("drink and carouse").

**Level 4:** Inspire a specific emotion in an audience.

Convey a short message to an audience, no matter what language they speak.

Change an audience's current mental state (sleepy, confused, or awake).

Convince an audience to follow a questionable course of action ("give me your money").

**Level 5:** Alter an audience's memories of an event.

Convince an audience to follow a dangerous course of action ("wander into the desert").

Conjure an illusion of an individual (with additional size magnitudes for very large individuals). (Ritual)

Change an individual's image (with additional magnitudes added for very large individuals, or for increasing the target's size). (Ritual)

**Level 10:** Place false memories of an event in an audience's minds.

Convince an audience to follow a heinous course of action ("attack each other").

Conjure an illusion of a group of individuals (with additional magnitudes added for larger groups). (Ritual)

Change the images of a group of individuals (with additional magnitudes added for larger groups). (Ritual)

is coming from the north" or "help, my daughter is lost" or "that man is an imposter." Anyone affected may make a Perception + Awareness roll against an Ease Factor of 12 to resist the effect, but success means they do not understand the underlying message.

If cast as a ritual spell, the sahir may continue to communicate short phrases in this way each subsequent round, for as long as the spirit maintains the spell, and may include newcomers into the effect by concentrating upon them for a round.

Some of the Nizari Isma'ili are rumored to plot assassinations using this spell, discussing their intended crimes in this way so that they cannot possibly be overheard by others.

(Base 4, +2 Ease Factor)

#### **Make their eyelids heavy and their heads to fall**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 15 Allure: Supernatural

All those within range of the sahir's voice are lulled to sleep unless they have supernatural perception, in which case they may shake off the effect with a Perception + (Ability) roll against an Ease Factor of 6. They may easily wake again if they are disturbed; they will sleep as long as they would if they had fallen asleep naturally.

To add his Area Lore to his total, the sahir usually tells a familiar story in a soothing voice. It takes 45 minutes to cast in this way, but does not seem like magic to his audience.

(Base 4, +3 Supernatural)

#### **Peal of familiar voices**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 15 Allure: Emotional

The sahir's audience is inspired with a feeling of loyalty and cooperative enthusiasm, a strong desire to work together with others in their community. In effect, everyone who listens to the performance receives a +3 bonus to Personality rolls associated with working together, as if the caster had the Inspirational Virtue. The Ease Factor to see through this illusion is 12.

(Base 4, +1 Emotional, +2 Ease Factor)

#### **A light distraction**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 20 Allure: Supernatural, Ritual

This spell causes the sahir's image to explode in a blinding flash of flame and then cease to be visible for the duration of the effect. Only those with some form of supernatural perception can see through this illusion at Ease Factor 6, though anyone in the sahir's audience with Magic Resistance is unaffected unless the spell penetrates.

(Base 5, +3 Supernatural)

#### **You will not remember me when I am gone**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 20 Allure: Unsuspecting

Through his performance, the sahir causes his audience to remember a completely different event happening instead, the details of which are woven into the naranj. For example, he might have them recall that they watched the sun set, or listened to an imam give a moving speech about the merits of children obeying their parents. Once the spell is cast, the sahir's audience might be briefly disoriented, as they try to remember what it is that they are doing. If the facts of this story are called into question, a successful Perception + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 6 allows them to remember the truth.

(Base 10, +2 Unsuspecting)

#### **Sow the seeds for a crop of betrayers**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 25 Allure: Unsuspecting

The sahir convinces his audience to perform a heinous act, specified at the time of casting, such as attacking each other, assaulting their leader, or burning down a mosque. Those who suspect they have been enchanted may make a Perception + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 9 to resist, otherwise they act as if they had decided on the action themselves, and proceed to carry out the command to the best of their abilities.

If they are prevented from fulfilling their orders, the desire to comply will fade over time, more or less quickly depending upon the mental state of the targets. Generally, the targets recover from the effect at about the same time they would wake if they fell asleep. If cast as a Ritual spell and maintained by a spirit, however, the effects endure and the sahir can suppress, restore, or even change the command by concentrating on the target.

(Base 10, +2 Unsuspecting, +1 Ease Factor)

#### **[Spirit]'s cave**

Solomonic Storytelling Level 30 Allure: Unsuspecting, Ritual

This ritual spell creates the illusion of a tall, hollow hill or dune, large enough to contain about a hundred people, their animals, and tents. This takes approximately an hour and a half, and costs the sahir six pawns of vis. Once the naranj is cast, the sahir and the people inside can see through the image if they make a Perception + Guile roll against an Ease Factor of 6, or the sahir can selectively drop the illusion for any of them by concentrating on the effect. This allows the people inside to watch others who approach with ease, most of whom will have no reason to doubt the image and almost certainly will travel around it, creating a perfect ambush site or hiding place. The illusion lasts for as long as the spirit maintains the effect, or until the sahir cancels it.

(Base 20, +2 Unsuspecting)

## *Solomonic Travel*

Solomonic Travel involves manipulating the power of the four supernatural realms. These spells open a passage through an individual target, which the sahir must draw upon or mark in some way; or else through a circle that he draws upon the ground or on a solid surface such as a wall or floor. To allow others to travel through this passage, the marked target or circle must be large enough for each individual to pass through it.

These effects have one parameter, Delay, which determines how long the sahir must wait for the effect to manifest. The markings or circle that he draws on the target must remain undisturbed until this time.



**Moon:** The effect manifests during the next full or new moon. (+1 magnitude)

**Sun:** The effect manifests at the next dawn or dusk. (+2 magnitudes)

**Immediate:** The effect manifests immediately. (+3 magnitudes)

The sahir can perform a mystic ceremony to augment his Casting Total, or to disguise his casting. This requires him to have a (Realm) Lore score of at least 3 (of the realm appropriate to the effect), consume special materials appropriate to the realm (e.g., candles, incense, offerings, sacrifices, etc.), and he must describe the effect upon the target with pictures or words. For example, a divine ceremony might require the burning of white candles and sweet incense while chanting appropriate passages of the *Qur'an* and inscribing them on the target.

#### **Solomonic Travel Spell Formulas**

The spells given here are specially designed for Solomonic Travel.

#### **[Spirit] brings the curse of Bayna**

Solomonic Travel General

Delay: Immediate

This effect causes an individual target that the sahir touches to immediately gain two Warping Points, unless the target makes a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor equal to three times (the magnitude of the spell – 3). For example, a Level 25 version has an Ease Factor of 6.

(Base effect, +3 Immediate, +1 additional Warping Point)

#### **The hush of solitude**

Solomonic Travel General Delay: Immediate

This effect closes a passage that has been opened with Solomonic Travel or a similar power, even one that is being maintained by a spirit or which has been created but has not yet manifested. At Level 20, it can cancel another effect of up to Level 20. At Level 35, it can cancel another effect of up to Level 50. At

## *Solomonic Travel Guidelines*

Active Solomonic Travel ritual spells grant the sahir supernatural senses, allowing him to see through illusions and perceive things that are imbued with supernatural power. Treat this as scores in both Magic Sensitivity and Second Sight equal to the magnitude of the spell for as long as the spirit maintains it. This supernatural sense is also affected by the Delay parameter, however, and does not actually manifest until the spell comes into effect, though the spirit must still maintain it until then.

A window or passage allows the sahir and anyone nearby to perceive species through it from another location, and allows those on the other side to perceive the sahir's location as well. These portals remain open as long as the spirit maintains the effect, and travel through a passage can be selectively granted or revoked to others by the spirit or as the sahir directs.

**General:** Give the target a Warping Point if it fails a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of (3 x (the spell's base magnitude + 1)). Additional magnitudes can also increase the number of Warping Points gained.

Restore a number of Might Points to a target equal to (the base level of the effect – 5).

Open a passage through a supernatural regio boundary of level no greater than (the base magnitude of this effect + 5).

Open a passage through the Twilight Void to a vestige or boundary in the Magic Realm of level no greater than the base magnitude of this effect (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 21–26).

Open a passage into the Faerie Realm through a supernatural aura of level no less than (10 – (the base magnitude of this effect + 1)) (see *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 20–23).

Close a window or passage opened with Solomonic Travel or a similar power if the magnitude of the canceled effect is less than ((this spell's base magnitude + 1) x 2).

Open a passage from the Faerie Realm to a supernatural aura with an aura bonus or penalty no less than (10 – (the base magnitude of this spell + 5)) (see *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 29-30). (Ritual)

Open a passage through a supernatural aura to another aura of the same realm, both auras of level no less than (10 – the base magnitude of this spell). (Ritual)

**Level 10:** Force the target to make an Aging roll.

**Level 15:** Open a passage into the Twilight Void (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 23–26). (Ritual)

Open a window through an Arcane Connection. (Ritual)

Open a window through which ghosts and other insubstantial beings can be seen. (Ritual)

Open a window into a sleeping person's dreams (see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, pages 102–111). (Ritual)

**Level 20:** Open a window to or from the physical world through a Magic Realm vestige or boundary (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 21-23). (Ritual)

**Level 25:** Open a passage that transforms the sahir and his companions into spirits for the duration. (Ritual) Open a passage into a sleeping person's dreams (see *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, pages 102–111). (Ritual)

Open a passage through an Arcane Connection. (Ritual)

**Level 30:** Open a direct passage to or from the Magic Realm through a vestige or boundary, bypassing the Twilight Void (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 21–23). (Ritual)

Open a direct passage to or from the Faerie Realm (see *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 29–30). (Ritual)


Level 50, it can cancel another effect of up to Level 80. The sahir must mark the passageway he is closing in some way, usually by drawing the sign of the Ashab al-Nahr upon it with a piece of charred wood or ash.

(Base effect, +3 Immediate)

#### **Through the gray haze**

Solomonic Travel General

Delay: Sun

At sunset or sunrise, the sahir opens passage through a regio boundary of level no greater than (the magnitude of this effect + 3). For example, a Level 10 spell would open passage through a boundary of 5 or less.

While this naranj works on boundaries aligned with any realm, the sahir may only incorporate his (Realm) Lore score if he correctly identifies the type of aura for the regio. If he guesses wrong, he receives no bonus.

(Base effect, +2 Sun)

#### **To the highest mountains of Qaf**

Solomonic Travel General

Delay: Season

When cast from within a supernatural aura, this spell opens a passage into the Faerie Realm (See *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 20–23). As a Level 5 spell, the origin aura strength must be 10, with each additional magnitude lowering the minimum aura strength by 1.

(Base effect)

#### **Warm as the life of day**

Solomonic Travel General Delay: Immediate

The sahir marks and concentrates upon a spirit or other supernatural being and restores a number of lost Might Points to its Might Pool. The number of Might Points it regains is equal to (the spell level – 20), so at Level 25 the target would recover 5 Might Points. Note that the naranj must also penetrate the being's Magic Resistance to have its effect.

This naranj may be used to restore Might Points to the spirit through which it is cast. This is because the sahir is actually drawing upon the concentrated power of one of the four realms to replenish his


target's Might, not the spirit's own power. (Base effect, +3 Immediate)

#### **We will meet again as the seasons turn**

Solomonic Travel General Delay: Season, Ritual

From within a supernatural aura, the sahir draws the outline of a portal that will lead to a different aura of the same realm that he has visited before. The levels of both auras can be no less than (10 – the magnitude of this spell), which means that a Level 45 spell is needed to enable travel to or from a Level 1 aura. If both auras are at least Level 5, a Level 25 spell is sufficient. Most commonly, sahirs use this naranj to enable travel to the yearly Majlis, and cast it at the very end of spring so that they can use it during summer.

(Base effect)

#### **Sight of many lifetimes**

Solomonic Travel Level 25 Delay: Immediate

The target touched by the sahir is briefly exposed to the harsh, timeless powers of one of the four supernatural realms, and must make an immediate Aging roll, even if the target is too young to require such rolls naturally. If the target is not living or is immortal, this naranj has no effect.

(Base 10, +3 Immediate)

#### **The magical minaret**

Solomonic Travel Level 30 Delay: Immediate, Ritual

The sahir draws upon the surface of a pool, the face of a rock, or a circle of sand, and once the ritual spell is complete he and any others he designates can perceive what is happening in a place to which he has an Arcane Connection. This supernatural perception goes both ways, so that others near the target can also see and hear the sahir and his companions, though it is clear who is actually there and who is on the other side. Those on either side of the magical window can even cast spells and use their powers through it. The window only remains open as long as the sahir's


spirit maintains the effect, however.

As this is a ritual spell, the sahir can open and close the window by concentrating, even selectively allowing or denying access to several at once. In addition, after the window opens the sahir gains supernatural senses equivalent to scores of 6 in Second Sight and Magic Sensitivity for as long as the effect lasts.

(Base 15, +3 Immediate)

#### **By the light of the ominous moon**

Solomonic Travel Level 30 Delay: Moon, Ritual

Like other Solomonic Travel spells, the sahir draws the doorway through which he will gain passage, and once the moon changes he and his companions step through this doorway into what sahirs call "the spirit realm." They pass through the doorway, yet once they reach the other side they are now insubstantial and invisible to other mortals, like a spirit, and mostly unable to affect them, physically or with their magic. They are also tangible to other spirits: they are able to see and interact with each other as if they were corporeal. Spirits who travel through the doorway experience just the opposite; they become physical and unable to interact with the spirit world without appropriate powers. (See *Realms of Power: Magic,* page 100, for more on how spirits interact with the physical world.)

Sahirs generally circumvent the delay by casting the spell during a full moon.

(Base 25, +1 Moon)

#### **The oubliette** *al-wazir*

Solomonic Travel Level 45 Delay: Immediate, Ritual

This ritual spell opens passage to a particular location in the Magic Realm, without requiring travel through the Twilight Void (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 21–23). It is said that the current grand vizier possesses an Arcane Connection to a pit in the middle of a great stone fortress located in that realm, built on an island in the middle of a cold and lonely sea. Traitors to the Suhhar can be quietly exiled to this prison through the use this spell.

## *Chapter Four*

# *The Jinn*

Amongst us [jinn] are some that submit their wills and some that swerve from justice. Now those who submit their wills, they have sought out the path of right conduct: but those who swerve, they are fuel for Hell-fire.

*— The Qur'an,* Al-Jinn: 1*4-15*

According to Islamic teaching, God created three classes of intelligent beings: the angels (*mala'ika,* sing., *malak*) made of light; the jinn ("the hidden," masc. sing. *jinni*, fem. sing. *jinniyya*) made of smokeless fire or aether; and humans (*al-Ins*) made of clay. Angels are God's direct servants at his side, while both humans and jinn are capable of salvation and were sent to populate the earth. Muhammad was tasked with bringing both jinn and humans to salvation and many jinn appear to have adopted Islam, but there are also jinn who have devoted themselves to tempting others and have rejected the message of the faith, risking damnation. It is said that the jinn were the original inhabitants of Earth but fell away from the worship of God. Iblis, the Islamic equivalent of the Devil, is recorded as being originally one of the most powerful of the ancient jinn. He fell to pride and refused to bow down to Adam when commanded by God.

All jinn occupy a constant place in the folklore of Islam and share several common characteristics. Some myths tell of impious humans that have transformed into jinn on their deaths, although whether this describes the creation of Infernal ghosts or transformation into Magic spirits or some kind of Faerie apotheosis is difficult to determine. The true nature of *bazarkh,* the soul's experiences immediately after death, has not been elucidated by the few Merinita and Criamon scholars interested in pursuing this state. See the "Terminology of Jinn" sidebar for further details.

All jinn are said to be composed of "smokeless fire" — the exact nature of this varies depending on the chosen Realm alignment of the particular jinni: Faerie jinn are composed of Glamour, Infernal jinn have bodies of rarefied power and Magic jinn are composed of pure magic. This magical body is usually aligned to the Form of Vim, rather than being flame associated with the Form of Ignem, although some jinn, particularly Magic jinn, are strongly aligned to the elemental Forms. Most jinn can assume a physical form composed of elemental matter or solid energy using one of their powers. Many have the ability to change their shape into elemental manifestations, animals, humanoid forms, or the shape of particular humans.

Jinn divide themselves into several main tribes that roughly correlate with their Realm alignment. Thus the Jann are lesser Faerie jinn that follow the ways of Islam and pass for human merchants, no-

## *Other Middle Eastern Spirits: Non-Jinn*

Common Muslim folk sometimes mistakenly refer to ghosts and other supernatural creatures from Arab folklore as jinn. Dhilan, ghaddars, hatifs, naddahas, nisnases, shiqq, and udars are not jinn in the sense given here, nor are the Persian divs, yazatas, and peris*.* However, Faerie jinn may mimic or assume roles similar to these creatures in order to entrap humans in their stories. These creatures have different origins than jinn: ghosts may have once been humans; some have been created by magical mishaps or the workings of ancient wizards; others are aligned to the Divine or Infernal Realms. Despite their name, the Faerie creatures referred to as Soqotran jinniyah and associated with the Myrrh trees of that island are not true jinn and are similarly unaffected by Sihr.

Arab folklore also blames many supernatural events and occurrences, including ghostly haunting, on the jinn. Thus the term "jinni" is also mistakenly used to describe any magical spirit, effect or creature. The lesser Airy Spirits, including the entities understood by Hermetic theory as Spell Spirits, are similarly explained using this lesser term, though they lack the cultural identity of true jinn. The Named Spirits of Hermetic Theurgy, such as the Astra Planeta daimons so well known to Arab wizards, are also not considered jinn*,* and are referred to instead as *al-Nujum,* "the Stars."

To the ignorant mundane, anything supernatural is jinn*,* but to a sahir, a jinni is a specific creature subject to the Art of Sihr and its legacy of command passed down from the wisdom of Suleiman. This makes dealing with unknown supernatural entities potentially difficult and dangerous for a sahir, and so most prefer to rely on knowledge passed down by their forebears and are very cautious when dealing with encountered spirits they have not summoned directly.

Sahirs using Sihr or their Solomonic Magic have no exceptional power over these other spiritual creatures but some may be able to use different magical abilities such as the Goetic Arts of Summoning and Commanding to affect these spirits.


mads, or shepherds, interacting with humans in stories involving hospitality and morality. The Shaitan are a collection of both dark Faerie and Infernal spirits, some of who have become corrupted into true terrestrial demons. The Ghul tribe consists of dark Faerie sexual predators and cannibalistic Infernal savages that haunt cemeteries and graveyards looking for carrion or lone travelers. The powerful Marid tribe are a loose alliance of ancient Magic elemental spirits of water, wind, and weather found predominantly in Arabia.

# *Terminology of Jinn*

The exact nature of jinn is difficult to define, as the term is used collectively to refer to a myriad of spirits variously aligned to the Faerie, Infernal and Magic Realms. There are no Divine jinn*,* only Islamic angels.

Other terms used within the various folk tales refer to rank or power within various tribes of jinn. The names *'afrit* and *marid* usually refer to the stronger types of Faerie jinn, although their relationship to humanity can be either benevolent or antagonistic depending on their defining role. Confusingly, the terms Ifrit and Marid also refer to two of more powerful of the reportedly 112 jinni tribes. The term "shaitan" typically refers to dark Faerie jinn but is also used to refer to Infernal jinn in general, the specific tribe of jinn known as Shaitan, and in many cases to Iblis himself.

## *Jinn Defined Mechanically*

The sahir summoning art of Sihr is defined in its scope by its limitation of summoning only jinn (see Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman). In this book, the term jinni refers specifically to the collective group of supernatural spirits (in Latin, *genii*) that inhabit the Islamic lands and are integral to wider Arab culture.

This definition includes jinn aligned to the Faerie Realm, as well as those genii loci found in Muslim lands aligned to the Magic realm. It also addresses a range of Infernal spirits: true demons of Islamic lands and wider Arab folklore, such as Iblis and his descendents; the ghul*;* and local Middle Eastern examples of demons, such as mazzikim and shedim.

Together they form a collective of entities of varied Realm alignment characterized by the following:

- • They share a common special Free Virtue: Jinni that denotes their unique status.
- • They have True Names that can be learned, even those jinn of low Might Score.
- • They are supernatural spirits native to the lands of the *Dar al-Islam:* the Levant, Iberia, the Maghreb, Egypt, Arabia, Iraq, Mesopotamia, Persia, and Transoxiana.
- • They have encountered Islam and chosen to accept (Faerie), reject (dark Faerie), ignore (Magic), or oppose (Infernal) the teachings of the Prophet.
- • They almost universally speak and understand Arabic (classical) as an Ability, Pretense, or via magic — rare ancient jinn may speak Aramaic, Hebrew or lost Semitic languages.
- • They have the Ability (or Pretense, if Faerie jinn) Theology: Islam (jinn) as part of their exposure to and incorporation into Arab culture.
- • They have some supernatural power that allows them to remain hidden when desired — either invisibility, immateriality, illusory form, or the ability to shapechange into animal guise.

Ultimately, the storyguide is the final arbiter on what is a jinni and what is not a jinni*.* Specific Faerie or Infernal jinni may not rigidly conform to the guidelines presented here if it suits their concept or role to be an exception — this may include select Hermetic and Heroic Virtues and Flaws at the discretion of the storyguide. Each jinni is an individual with his own unique place in the story. Be creative.



Ghosts, demons that are not specifically Infernal jinn, and the European spirits of the Faerie and Magic Realm familiar to Hermetic magi are definitely not jinn. Creatures of Virtue and other physical creatures with a Might score are also not jinn.

## *Common Jinn Traits*

Most jinn who interact regularly with humans possess the Faerie Speech Minor Virtue or an equivalent power such as the Minor Heroic Virtue Gift of Tongues instead, giving them the ability to converse in all spoken languages. Some of the rarely-encountered pre-Islamic jinn may claim to speak only Aramaic, or some other ancient Semitic language.

Jinn frequently have Second Sight and a Greater Malediction stating that, when it enters a bargain, it is bound to the agreed terms unless its partner reneges first. The supernatural nature of jinn is usually apparent to regular humans and some animals, such as cats, dogs and horses, although this is reflected in different Flaws for jinn of different Realms as noted later. Many humanoid jinn possess one or more of the Skinchanger Minor Virtue and the Ways of the Land (Desert or, less commonly, Mountains or Plains) and the Greater Immunity: Fire Major Virtues.

As spiritual beings, jinn must possess the Donning the Corporeal Veil Power (for Magic jinn) or a similar power, such as Coagulation (for Infernal jinn) or an equivalent (for Faerie jinn), in order to create a physical body that can interact with material beings. Some minor jinn, such as the Faerie jann and the Infernal ghul, are spirits locked into a physical form, but they can shapechange into at least one other form or become insubstantial or invisible for short periods of time.

Jinn are generally considered extremely long-lived (equivalent to the effects of the Faerie Blood Minor Virtue) but are not always immortal, and many lesser jinn have the Age Quickly Major Flaw rather than being truly immortal spirits.

Not all jinn have Confidence, but many Faerie jinn possess the Reputation as Confidence Virtue, which grants Confidence to be used for specific actions re-

## *Jinni Names*

Jinni names, while similar to those of the humans of the Mythic Middle East, have their own peculiarities. Generally, such names fall into several broad categories and follow conventions similar to other Arab names including the use of nasab, kunya and nisbas. Only the more powerful ranks of jinn such as the *'*afrit and marid have multiple names, often using an honorific name to describe their greatness (laqab) (see the Appendix for further details on names).

The first group of names includes those jinn named after common animals of which they can assume the shape, particularly in the case of Faerie jinn. Such names include:

Af'aa ("Snake"), Arnab ("Hare"), Baghl ("Mule"), Fa'r ("Mouse"), Feel ("Elephant"), Hemaar ("Donkey"), Hesaan ("Horse"), Jamal ("Camel"), Kalb ("Dog"), Maa'ez ("Goat"), Nasr ("Vulture"), Qett ("Cat"), and so forth. Many Magic jinn are named after the natural feature they are associated with as their locus: Amirat al-Jabal ("lady emir of the mountain"), Ighraq al-Siq ("torrent of the gorge"). Others have titular names or nicknames (nisba): 'Abd al-Qinnina ("slave of the bottle"), Bali' al-Ard ("swallower of the ground"), al-Damawi ("the bloody"), al-Ghazzalin ("the weaver"), al-Khalil ("the Empty One"), al-Malik ("the king"), al-Qatil ("the slayer").

Finally, many Faerie jinn have names that seem almost human but have an unreal or dissonant quality to them, for example: Anees al-Galees, Jerjees, Kabikaj, Kharrat, Khyron, Qumqam, Singam, Sakr, Zamzam, Zarmabaha. Troupes are encouraged to generate these latter names by changing some of the letters of Arabic, Aramaic, Turkish or Persian names at random.

## **Story Seed: The List of Suleiman**

King Suleiman was granted dominion over all jinn by God and many sahirs believe that the Art of Sihr is directly descended from his powers. Legends speak of a codex written by the prophet containing the True Names of all jinn, a priceless treasure for any summoner. The list can reputedly update and edit itself magically as jinn are born and die.

Some sahirs claim to have found fragments of Suleiman's list amidst the pages of other books dealing with (Realm) Lore — pages on which archaic names sometimes disappear or emerge between readings. Whether these pages are truly fragments of the greater list or Faerie books created from the legend is unclear — not all the names appear to be genuine True Names. Both Hermetic magi and sahirs may seek to recover such fragments in the hope of reconstructing either the whole text or discovering the means of capturing the True Names of new jinn*.*

lated to their roles, similar to the Ferocity Virtue of animals. Some Infernal jinn have lost the ability to act contrary to the dictates of their passions, transforming into true terrestrial demons, and thus lack a Confidence score.

## *Jinn and Free Will*

Although jinn appear to possess free will, Islamic scholars believe this may not be true. The Ghul and Shaitan tribes have already made a choice to side with evil and this decision is reflected in their predominantly dark Faerie nature. Those individual Infernal jinn who have become true demons have sacrificed their free will on becoming irrevocably aligned with Iblis and the Infernal. Faerie jinn may act as if they have freedom but, in truth, their choices are restrained by the roles and stories they inhabit.

All jinn claim a common origin in Jinnistan. Some sahirs and scholars speculate that this means jinn began as creatures of the Magic Realm born with free will, and



## *Jumayl, A Jinni Guide*

This lesser jinni has been created as an example starting magus-level character using the full rules from *Realms of Power: Faerie.* The selection of skills and particular powers are designed to be useful for a party traveling through the Mythic Middle East. His need for vitality and human interaction to recover Might points provide a strong hook to involve him in adventures and active stories, making him a good choice to accompany magi as a guide throughout the area covered by this book.

Jumayl may be found in any major city in the region or even the ports of the Levant, but he favors the bustling markets around the fortress of al-Mushaqqar in Bahrayn (see Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia), where well-paid work and cheap alcohol can be easily found.

#### **Powers:**

*Cuirass of the Zephyr,* 1 point, Init +3, Auram; *as Circling Winds of Protection*  with Duration of Recitation / Qira'a (as long as Jumayl keeps reciting verses of the *Qur'an* — equivalent to Concentration).

*Blinding Light of the Pious,* 1 point, Init +3, Ignem; as *Flash of the Scarlet Flames.*

*Tay al-Ard (Travel)*, 4 points, Init +1, Corpus; this power instantly transports Jumayl and 2 individuals he holds hands with from one location to another that he has visited before or has an Arcane Connection to, regardless of distance. As Leap of Homecoming, with R: Touch, T: Group, 45 spell levels, 1 Intricacy point spent on reduced cost.

**Equipment:** a fine damascene steel long sword, leather scale caravan guard armor, flashy jewelry

**Vis:** 3 pawns of Vim vis, camel's tooth

**Appearance:** Jumayl ("little camel") is a comely, lithe man of uncertain oriental appearance, alabaster skin and white hair. One eye is iridescent green, the other ocean blue. He favors swirling robes dyed a deep blue color over light leather armor, highlighted by gold jewelry.

This jinni*,* one of the jann*,* is a mercenary guide, forced to wander from caravanserai to caravanserai along the trade routes of the Levant, Arabia, Persia, Transoxiana, and beyond for a crime his brother committed. An excellent swordsman and skilled outdoorsman, he is well known among the Muslim merchants and even Levantine Redcaps for his easy-going nature and bravado in defending caravans from raiders and brigands. Like most Faerie jinn*,* he can change into an animal form — in his case, a white wild Bactrian camel using his Skinchanger Virtue.

Although immune to Fatigue like other faeries, Jumayl is unusually susceptible to the effects of mundane alcohol — a weakness that helps him to play his role within stories along the caravan routes. Unlike most faeries, due to his Might Recovery Requires Vitality Flaw, his Might points, once spent, can only recover if he gets a full night's rest and eats a meal in the company of fellow travelers. This must be done within a human community, eating travel rations or caravanserai meals, drinking beverages fermented by humans and listening to humans sing or tell tales about their travels. For every eight hours the character rests, he recovers a number of Might Points equal to the prevailing Aura as modified by the Realm Interaction Table, or 1, whichever is greater. He does not actually need to eat or drink however. Jumayl knows enough about wizards to avoid leaving Arcane Connections carelessly and keeps his True Name a close secret.

His powers have been created as Greater Powers but could readily be reduced to Lesser Powers to downgrade him to a standard companion if his Ostentatious Major Virtue, 2 Increased Faerie Might Minor Virtues and Highly Cognizant Minor Virtues were also dropped. In this case, his Might Recovery Requires Vitality Major Flaw should be replaced with three Minor Flaws. Alternatively, if used as an NPC, his Virtues and Flaws do not need to balance and further powers with illusions or summoning animals could be added.


changed their Realm alignment to either Faerie or the Infernal only after interacting with humanity and coming into contact with Islam, losing their free will in the process.

The fact of the matter is unclear jinn may only appear to change Realms. For example, a Magic jinni of a local geographic feature may be replaced by a Faerie jinni created through stories of its interactions with nearby Muslims. Alternatively an Infernal jinni*,* attracted by the potential for sin created by the presence of pagan Magic spirit, may destroy the original genius loci and take its place. To common folk and even magi, the jinni may appear to have changed Realms as the new spirit assumes the name, appearance, and role of the original entity.

## *Pious and Impious Jinn*

Those jinn who profess to have submitted to or rejected Islam are aligned to the Faerie Realm. Often referred to as pious and impious jinn, their religious behavior is a sham required by their roles in that they appear to uphold or illustrate Islam's tenets as an example or challenge to humans. This type of jinni is the one most likely to be involved with mundanes and they are frequently encountered in the Mythic Middle East.

These creatures often live in groups like humans and mimic the behavior and culture of their mundane neighbors, often appearing as merchants, shepherds and nomads, although city-dwelling jinn are frequently encountered in the farther reaches of the Mythic Middle East. Such jinn generally live in close proximity to humans but in places humans find inhospitable: deserts, ruins, wastelands, and abandoned houses, or in wells, cisterns, latrines, and other taboo places. Together they comprise a group of Faeries involved in meddling with humans in a variety of boundary stories, whether physically or philosophically, but most commonly representing tales concerned with social distinctions or adulthood.

Most of these Faerie-aligned jinn share the following Virtues and Flaws in addition to those noted earlier for all jinn: Eidolon,

## *Bali' al-Ard, a Bedouin racehorse*

Beloved by his master, a young Bedouin sahir named Salih al-Kamil, this jinni takes the form of an exceptional Arabian stallion renowned for his racing ability. His magical travel powers and lack of fatigue allow him to cheat during the dust and confusion of longer desert races. This gives his master great status and pride, feeding his need for Vitality, but is also the source of continual harassment from horse breeders wishing to mate their mares in the hope of producing talented offspring. As they are unaware of the Faerie nature of the horse, such suitors do not realize that time out at stud deprives his master of his magical aid and that such unions will always be unsuccessful in producing foals.

This jinni can only assume animal form although he is able to become immaterial. He is an example of a potential khadim (servant spirit) of a beginning unGifted sahir with only limited scores in the Solomonic Arts. See Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman for more details of khadim and sahir.

Bali is not balanced for use as a starting player character and is based on an Arabian racing horse — essentially a modified courser. Like all horses he gains a +3 to running rolls.




## *Bottles of Suleiman, Slaves of the King*

There we saw a man casting his net to catch fish, and presently he pulled them up and behold, in them was a cucurbite of copper, stopped with lead and sealed with the signet of Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace! He brought the vessel to land and broke it open, when there came forth a smoke, which rose a twisting blue to the zenith, and we heard a horrible voice, saying, 'I repent! I repent! Pardon, O Prophet of Allah! I will never return to that which I did aforetime.' Then the smoke became a terrible Giant frightful of form, whose head was level with the mountaintops, and he vanished from our sight...

— Tale of the "The City of Brass," *The Thousand and One Nights*

Folk tales abound in Eastern folklore of poor fisherman who cast their nets into the ocean, calling upon God's aid only to pull in strange and ancient bottles. Termed "cucurbites" and known to the peasant folk as Suleimanic Bottles, these vessels are gourd-shaped copper flasks sealed with a lead plug embossed with the Seal of Suleiman. When the stopper is removed, a jinni issues forth, either thankful or wrathful toward its rescuer, but always a potential source of wealth or woe. In some tales the prison is in the form of a seal ring, or, most famously, a humble battered lamp. The origin of these mystical containers is unclear — some may indeed represent pre-Islamic jinn bound by Suleiman in ancient days, while other examples may represent echoes of the legends of spirits bound by his magical descendants and contemporary sorcerers.

So popular has this motif become in Arab folklore that a particular type of Faerie jinn, the Bottles of Suleiman, have become associated with this story, taking the form of the vessels themselves. Typically involved in stories about the Bringing of Riches and Humility (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 79), these liminal entities can be found anywhere along the shorelines of Islamic lands, usually near the villages of poor fishermen.

**Personality Traits:** Proud +3, Sly +3, Cruel +2

**Reputations:** Terrifyingly magical +3 **Pretenses:** Penetration 6, Theology: Islam 1 (jinn)

#### **Powers:**

*Binding Oath*, 5 points, Init –19, Vim; Voice, Penetration +15; Upon "releasing" the apparently captive 'afrit from its prison, the rescuer can bargain for a set three wishes or a length of conditional service depending on the personality of the individual Faerie jinni, provided he agrees to destroy the cucurbite and permanently release the jinni from captivity. 50 levels, Ritual Power, 5 Intricacy points spent on reduced cost.

*Eidolon*, 2 points, Init –2, Imaginem; This power allows the Suleimanic Bottle to manifest its glamour both as the prop known as a cucurbite that appears to contain its essence and then in a second form as a towering humanoid column of smoke issuing from the mouth of its prison. 20 spell levels, selected twice.

*Illusionary Home*, 4 points, Init –4, Imaginem; Creates a sumptuous phantasmal palace for the bearer of the cucurbite. 40 spell levels.

*Flight*, 3 points, constant, Auram, Touch; 30 spell levels as *Wings of the Soaring Wind*. *Loosely Material,* variable points, Init –5, Corpus; The spirit can form either a simple physical manifestation of its cucurbite that can be touched by a potential master or add substance to its 'afrit form so it can bear loads, invoke Touch range powers or engage in combat at the request of its master. 25 spell levels.

*Tay al-Ard (Travel)*, 4 points, Init +1, Corpus; This power instantly transports the 'afrit and others it carries from one location to another that the bearer of its cucurbite has visited before or has an Arcane Connection to, regardless of distance. As *Leap of Homecoming*, with R: Touch, T: Group. 50 spell levels, 1 Intricacy point spent on reduced cost.

*Serendipitous Wealth*, 10 points, Init –9, Terram; This power seemingly grants the effects of the Wealthy Virtue, but similar to the Wealth of Nations power of False Gods, summons treasure from somewhere else. (See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 37). 50 spell levels, Ritual Power (Grant: Wealthy), 5 Intricacy points spent on cost.

**Vis:** 6 pawns of Imaginem, concentrated in its cucurbite prop

**Appearance:** These Faeries initially appear as their cucurbite, a solid gourd-shaped flask of copper, using their Eidolon and Loosely Material powers. They shift into their smoky column form only when the Seal of Suleiman stoppering their apparent prison is disturbed. This latter form consists of a giant human torso of unnatural color, often red, but sometimes blue or green, surmounted by a monstrous face with horns or jagged teeth. To the inexperienced observer, this fearsome manifestation appears to be the actual faerie, although in reality the jinni remains an insubstantial spirit beneath the illusion.

Bottles of Suleiman is not suitable as player characters due to their unbalanced power and their limited independent potential in stories. Only an exceptionally experienced sahira would be able to bind this powerful version as a spirit companion using the khadim bond, although lesser examples of this type of jinn may be attractive to younger sahira. This jinni is primarily inspired by the stories "The Fisherman and the Jinni" and "The City of Brass."


Loosely Material, Intangible Flesh, and Traditional Ward (Bismillah Invocation), or rarely, Sovereign Ward (Bismillah Invocation). These jinn commonly have powers associated with illusions, flight, shape changing (into animals, whirlwinds or other humans), and travel, rather than the elemental-themed powers of their Magic cousins. Many Faerie jinn suffer from the Minor Flaws Dutybound (Bedouin hospitality), Vulnerable to Brass, Vulnerable Magic (mua'addhin's call) and/or Vulnerable to Folk Tradition. Unlike most other faeries, Faerie jinn possess True Names as noted earlier, even if they have a low Might Score.

The minor Faerie jinn known as jann are highly dependent on human interaction and differ from their cousins in that they must have a physical form, although every janni can transform into at least one other shape, usually an animal. Such lesser Faerie jinn have the following Virtues and Flaws: Humanoid Form, Pass as Human, Dutybound (Bedouin hospitality), Restricted Might Recovery, Traditional Ward: Bismillah Invocation.

Examples of Faerie jinn with details of some of the Virtues, Flaws and powers mentioned earlier include the Bottles of Suleiman, Faerie ghulas*,* Hesaan the racehorse, and the janni Mythic Companionlevel character, Jumayl, detailed nearby.

Faerie jinni counterparts to many European faeries exist within the Mythic Middle East and can be adapted for use in a saga set in the Mythic Middle East, see the Faerie Bestiary of *Realms of Power: Faeries*, pages 70–83, for further details.

#### **Pre-Islamic Jinn**

Long ago during al-Jahiliyya, the pre-Islamic times of the past, Faerie jinn claiming Jewish and Christian beliefs were common. Even in the days before the Great Deluge, the jinn are purported to have followed the original monotheistic religion of Adam. Such jinn would be also considered Faerie rather than Magic in alignment, but are seemingly rare in the thirteenth century.

Many jinn are said to have been imprisoned in ancient times by the Suleiman. These jinn either declare their faith


in the older forms of religion when encountered or else claim to have converted to Islam somehow during their captivity. Such ancient Faerie jinn can be difficult to distinguish from the elemental jinn noted later, even for experienced sahirs, and play roles in stories about discoveries of the past and the fleeting nature of mortal achievements.

## *Pagan Jinn*

Jinn that show little interest in the affairs of mankind or the message of the Prophet are typically aligned with the Magic Realm. Referred to as pagan or heathen (*kaffir*, "unbeliever") jinn, these elemental spirits are tied to specific landscape features in the wilderness that lies between the major settlements of Arab civilization across Persia, the Holy land, North Africa, and southern Iberia. This natural feature may be an oasis pool, a mountain or a stretch of desert. These spirits are true genii loci, only able to leave their feature through transferring their locus to an individual or object through a form of magical bargain, and may reflect the most ancient and original manifestation of jinn — spirits defined by their geographic identity rather than their reflection of and interaction with Islamic culture.

Some of these pagan jinn claim to represent pre-Islamic divinities worshiped by the Arabs in ancient times or ancient powers of long lost races and cultures, but they are not dependent on human vitality like their Faerie counterparts. As Islam spread, other initially non-Arab Magic spirits were forced to adapt, accepting additional Inferiorities in return for retaining their places of power or else evolving into Faerie or Infernal versions of their former manifestations like the Forest Spirits of ancient Germany (see Chapter 3: The Forest of *Guardians of the Forest* for further ideas).

As primal Magic creatures, many have strong elemental ties. They are aligned with one of the classical elemental Forms of Auram, Aquam, Ignem and Terram and can be affected by the appropriate El-



## *Variants on the Genie of the Lamp Motif*

The creature 'Abd al-Qininna reflects a reasonably powerful version of this motif — an *'*afrit able to drastically change the fortunes of the poor man who releases it. In contrast, the simplest and least powerful of this class may possess only the Eidolon power, have much diminished characteristics and merely dissipate upon release with a great show of imagery and an exclamation in praise of Allah and Suleiman. These lesser jinn feed off the vitality shed by the simple wonder of the common fisherman before dissolving their cucurbite or projecting an illusion of it washing back out to sea in the confusion caused.

Although bottles are the commonest form for the cucurbite prop, similar Faerie jinni prisons have been described that manifest as brass rings, bowls, or most famously as a battered lamp. The creature portrayed in the Aladdin story would be more powerful than the one described here, perhaps with a Might of 50 or more and extra magical powers. An intermediate example with a Faerie Might of only 20 would simulate the "Slave of the Ring" in the Tale of Aladdin or one of the lesser jinni initially called upon by Suleiman to fetch the throne of Balqis, Queen of Sheba.

#### **Three Wishes?**

Many captive Faerie jinn are compelled by their story to bargain or create a contract with their rescuer. Typically, such jinn offer three wishes, within their power, using their Binding Oath Ritual Power. The price of the compact is usually the promise of release from further imprisonment once service has been rendered. Breaking the contract inflicts a Major Flaw. Depending on how carefully the party promising release has couched the terms of the contract, this Flaw may either allow the 'afrit to angrily depart, cursing its arrogant rescuer with a poor reputation (Faerie Antipathy, Major) or to remain and torment the foolish knave until driven off (Plagued by Supernatural Entity).

Those experienced in the bargains of jinn, possessing a Faerie Lore score of 6 or greater or one of the applicable summoning Arts or Accelerated Abilities at 11 or more, know to include the appropriate caveats to prevent the latter occurrence. These individuals are also aware of the correct formulae to command the released Faerie back into its prison, successfully ending the story safely. Of course, the knowledge of what to use the third and final wish for does not protect against the temptation of greed.

emental Summoning Art, although they have true intelligence and are not considered simple elementals. Other jinn embody the living Herbam aspects of nature. Such Magical jinn, being Magical Spirits, need not eat or drink and do not age unless they suffer from the optional Age Quickly Flaw.

These elemental creatures are the type of jinn most commonly summoned by both non-Hermetic and Hermetic sahirs and are generally the most easy to identify as jinn using either Magic Lore or an appropriate Area Lore (see Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman). Each has a mandatory Ways of the (Land) Virtue and Magical Air Flaw. These jinn may possesses some or all of the following Powers: Donning the Corporeal Veil (at least once for humanoid form, although additional animal forms are common), Guide, Manifestation and Presence. Crafter of (Form) and/or Ruler of (Form) are common among greater genii loci but optional for lesser jinn. The most powerful examples of these pagan jinn are true Daimons (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 110). The jinni Wahhab is an example of a Pagan jinn (see *Houses of Hermes: Societates,* page 135)*.*

Unlike their Faerie and Infernal cousins, Magic jinn are not automatically susceptible to the Bismillah Invocation, although many of the less powerful entities possess a Minor Flaw mechanically equivalent to the Traditional Ward (Bismillah Invocation) of their Faerie cousins. Some of the more powerful entities with greater familiarity with the teachings of Islam, as represented by a Theology: Islam score of 3 or more, may even feign submissiveness to catch an unsuspecting sahir off-guard.

The great Daimon of the Empty Quarter, Al-Khalil, mentioned in Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia, the jinni at the base of the Whirlpool of Uballa (Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia) or the feared ruler of the Taklimakan (Chapter 9: On the Silk Road) would all be appropriate to design as powerful Magic jinn.

# **Creating Magic Jinn by Example: Baghl and Ighraq al-Siq**

**Baghl,** see insert earlier, has been created by using the lesser flame jinni Wahhab from *Houses of Hermes: Societates,*  page 135, as a starting point, changing his Form alignment to Terram but retaining his resistance to flames. He is an example of a lesser earth jinni that might be pressed into service by a more mature sahir as a khadim, and is not designed as a starting character. Alternatively, he could be a potential patron for a Spirit Votary if he could be coaxed out of his cave, but would need to add the Grant: Spiritual Pact Ritual Power, which may require trading additional Inferiorities (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 88–89, for details of Spirit Votaries). As a spirit of a place, the physical location haunted by this jinni acts as an Arcane Connection that provides a +1 bonus to the Penetration Multiplier; more potent Arcane Connections can only be obtained from the jinni if he takes corporeal form.

Unusually for a jinni of his power, Baghl has a reasonable knowledge of Islam and may pretend to be susceptible to the folk traditions that affect Faerie jinn, although except for the muezzin's call, such rituals have no real effect over him.

**Ighraq al-Siq**, from Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia, is an example of a very powerful Magic jinni with a strong el-


emental affinity designed as an Autumn starting character using the rules from *Realms of Power: Magic*, but Magic jinn do not necessarily have to be balanced to be used in play. He could potentially be summoned and perhaps even controlled by an experienced sahir or Hermetic magus. As these spirits are bound to a landscape feature or compelled to a magical bargain, they are best designed as non-player characters or as challenges for the troupe, rather than companions in a conventional saga. This character can be used as a template for similar elemental jinn using the suggestions earlier and the rules for genii loci Magic Spirits as detailed in *Realms of Power: Magic* (pages 106–107) and ideas from the section on

elementals (pages 132–139). Note that his base Magic Might for character creation using the rules in *Realms of Power: Magic* is 35, although this as been increased to 40 using repeated purchase of the Improved Might Virtue.

He differs in powers from many Faerie jinn in that his magic is primarily elemental rather than illusory and is greatly focused by the physical constraints of his narrow surroundings. Like many other pagan jinn he is supernaturally tethered to his physical locale and suffers a significant drop in power if separated from it — in his case, he is tied to the body of the Zab River and is reluctant even to step onto its banks.

Alternatively this creature can be used

as the inspiration for a similar Faerie creature or an Infernal jinn related to the Order of Aerial Powers. A medium powered creature would have a Might of 20–25, being roughly comparable in power to a starting Hermetic magus, and could easily be aligned to Auram or Terram instead with some minor modification.

Unlike most Magical spirits of similar magnitude, Ighraq al-Siq does not possess the Daimon Special Virtue, although he does possess a True Name like all jinn. If granted the Daimon Virtue, he can only be bargained with using Hermetic Theurgy and cannot be controlled or coerced using simpler magic (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 102).

*Flesh to Stone,* 2 points, Init –4, Terram; Baghl can change any human he touches into stone until sunrise or until the morning call to prayer (Base 20, +1 Touch, +2 Sun; 3 Mastery points spent on reducing Might cost).

*Ruler of Earth*, 1–3 points, Init 0, Terram; Duplicates any non-Ritual Perdo Terram or Rego Terram spell less than or equal to 15th level at a cost of 1 Might point per magnitude of the effect.

*Incorporeal*, 0 points, Init Constant, Mentem: Baghl is naturally both invisible and intangible, and cannot be influenced by the physical world. Magic can only directly target him if the caster can sense his existence. In this form he has no physical statistics or combat scores. Without taking a corporeal form, Baghl's physical characteristics are only used when dealing with other incorporeal creatures.

*Donning the Corporeal Veil*, 2 points, Init +1, Corpus: Baghl can form the physical body described under Appearance to house his spiritual form; when doing so he acquires the physical characteristics, size, combat statistics, and Wound levels listed earlier. His arms and armor are also created with this power. He cannot become fatigued. This body lasts until he decides he no longer needs it. Killing the body does not kill Baghl.

*Presence*, 0 points, constant, Mentem: Baghl is aware of everything that goes on within his haunt. This power needs to Penetrate to perceive beings with a Magic Resistance.

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Terram vis can be collected every year from his haunt, in the form of a quartz-encrusted stalactite at the back of his cave. If slain in physical form, his body yields 3 pawns of Terram vis.

**Appearance:** Baghl is the jinni of a dark cave found in the Elbruz mountains that was once used as a quarry until he drove off the miners. He may be appeased mainly by being left alone to enjoy his beautiful cave formations, although he sometimes agrees to converse with theological scholars. He appears as an obese man with a mule's head, pupilless eyes of jetblack stone, and quartz-veined limbs that heft an oversized maul. In physical form he can assume the shape of a large black mule.



## *The Buran of Yenghissar*

This wild desert storm spirit, or buran, once plagued the small village of Yenghissar along the route to Khashgar, bringing devastation to the crops and herd animals every seven years. It is now bound by an Infernally-aligned sahir using the Goetic Art of Binding (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 117). A speechless, destructive force of fury incarnate, it rages to be released and constantly strives to create elemental havoc around the thoughtless sahir who has trapped it within his ancestral sword.

#### **The Buran**

**Infernal Might:** 25 (Auram) **Order: Aerial Powers (Buran)**

**Characteristics:** Int –5, Per 0, Pre +3, Com -2, Str na, Sta na, Dex +3, Qik +6

**Size:** +4

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Jinni; Berserk, Strong-Willed, Wilderness Sense; Fury (Major) (when summoned), Greater Malediction (bound by bargains), Mute

**Personality Traits:** Untameable +5

**Reputations:** Scourge of Yenghissar 2 (local)

**Hierarchy:** 3 (storm demons)

**Combat:** Not applicable, the buran is an insubstantial spirit

**Soak:** Not applicable, the buran is an insubstantial spirit

**Wound Penalties**: Not applicable, the buran is an insubstantial spirit

**Abilities:** Arabic 5 (understanding)\*, Folk Ken 3 (travelers), Theology: Islam 3 (jinn), Survival 5 (desert), Taklamakan Lore 5 (legends), Wilderness Sense 2 (weather)

\* Represents level of understanding as the spirit is Mute.

#### **Powers:**

*Delusion of the Desert,* 1 or 5 points, Init +3, Imaginem: This evil spirit can create illusions of a lost traveler's companions or a welcoming oasis, only to launch itself in fury at an unsuspecting victim. Alternatively it can create images of itself as a humanoid sandstorm with glowing fiery eyes in order to terrify its victims prior to their deaths. A minor illusion which affects an Individual amount of material (such as the demon itself) costs one point; a larger illusion which fills a room costs five points. These visions always have a flaw, however (they smell wrong, can only be seen by one target, etc.).

*Elemental Control of Wind* ; variable points; Init +1; Auram: The buran has control over the winds of nature, which it uses to wreak destruction on the desert fringes. It may create any Creo, Muto, or Rego effect appropriate to Auram, at a cost of 1 Might Point per magnitude of effect. The demon cannot create any effect with a level greater than its Infernal Might, nor duplicate Ritual effects.

*Recalcitrance*, 0 points, Init constant, Vim: Any attempt to control (but not destroy) the buran with any form of Supernatural Power (magical, Divine, or otherwise) treats the demon's Might as if it were 150% its actual Might, or otherwise has its Ease Factor increased by 50%. For example, a *Circular Ward Against Demons* of 38th level is needed to stop this buran with Might 25.

**Weaknesses:** Protected Group (individuals that invoke the Bismillah invocation)

**Vis:** 5 pawns of Auram vis prava, left behind as black sand when dispersed.

**Appearance:** Usually manifests as a giant shapeless vortex of raging black sand using its Auram powers. To those with Second Sight, a giant humanoid shadow can be discerned within the sandstorm.

Unlike many other corrupt jinn, the buran lacks the *Coagulation* and *Obsession*

powers common to most demons and is an insubstantial spirit, unable to affect the physical world except through its magic. It is an example of an Infernal storm spirit likely to be found in the Taklamakan Desert, although much stronger and less powerful creatures also exist (see Chapter 9: On the Silk Road). Many travelers' tales tell of companions fallen behind who are tempted off the track by the illusions created by these demons.

Those storm spirits aligned to the Magic realm may have very similar characteristics, although they lack the Recalcitrance power and the brutal malevolence of their demonic cousins. Similar spirits aligned to other elemental Forms can be represented with modifications to these statistics.

#### **Story Seed: The Corruption of the West**

European demons of Christian origin are becoming increasingly common in the Levant since the advent of the Crusades, but have yet to penetrate past the borders of Outremer. Apart from a handful of Jewish demons and Infernal entities from ancient Persian mythology, the vast majority of Infernal creatures in the Mythic Middle East are in fact Infernal jinn and thus susceptible to Sihr, as commonly practiced by the Order of Suleiman.

All this will change as merchants, missionaries and Hermetic magi penetrate further east, bringing with them their own legacies of sin and corruption that may change the balance of mystical power in the Mythic Middle East. The Unholy Trinity (see Chapter 1: Saga and Introduction) are a group of demons drawing on western conceptions of Islam that may have a large role to play in increasing the number of non-jinn Infernal spirits of the Mythic Middle East.


## *Learning from Jinn*

As creatures of embodied magical power, all jinn, regardless of Realm alignment, can act as sources of study, akin to the observation of magically occurring phenomena referred to by Hermetic magi as significatos (*Covenants,* page 101). Each individual jinni acts as the equivalent of a tractatus on a single appropriate Hermetic Form (typically an elemental Form for Magic jinn, Imaginem for Faerie jinn*,*  and Vim for Infernal jinn), the Accelerated Ability Sihr and their aligned (Realm) Lore. The jinni does not teach the summoner, nor does it need to possess a score in the relevant Art or Ability, as it is the summoner's observation of the Essential Nature of the jinni rather than the jinni's knowledge that is the key. The summoner may only gain the benefit for one Ability or Art per season.

To gain the benefits of study, a sahir or other summoner must coerce a jinni or jinniyya into service for a whole season. Such coercion may be in the form of a non-magical bargain, Sihr, Hermetic Rego magic with an appropriate duration, the non-Hermetic Goetic Art of Commanding, or the Hedge Art of Elemental Controlling (for Magic jinn associated with an elemental Form). Mundane threats able to be enforced by effective Rego or Perdo magic may be used to force an appropriate non-magical bargain, although the jinni will seek revenge on its enslaver.

A jinni can only instruct its master once for each Ability or Art.

## *Corrupt Jinn*

In **Ars Magica** terms, corrupt jinn include those terrestrial demons strongly aligned to Arab folklore and medieval Islamic culture found in Islamic lands. Many demonic-appearing jinn are actually dark Faerie creatures, who choose to accept or reject the Islamic faith as part of their role within stories involving humans. Making the correct distinction between jinn of different Realm alignment can be difficult for even experienced sahir but once a jinni aligns with the Infernal, it has irrevocably transformed into a true demon.

All Infernal jinn share the following Vulnerabilities in addition to the Virtues and Flaws noted earlier for all jinn: Bismillah Invocation and Iron. Most Infernal jinn similarly suffer from the Minor Flaw Vulnerable to Folk Tradition. Dark Faerie jinn have Virtues, Flaws and Powers similar to their pious jinn cousins detailed earlier.

Infernal jinni counterparts to the following demons found in Realms of Power: the Infernal can be encountered throughout the Mythic Middle East: mazzikim, succubi and lesser evil spirits would be classed as shaitan, whereas many *'*afrit with close elemental ties are best represented by Aerial Powers or perhaps powerful False Gods with additional powers related to elemental control.

Aside from their appearance and the modifications noted earlier, these jinn can be represented by the same statistics as their European cousins. Further details on demons are given in *Realms of Power: The Infernal*.

## **The Dangers of Distinction: Dark Faerie or Infernal?**

The distinction between dark Faerie jinn and truly Infernal jinn can be difficult, as both types of creatures are commonly referred to as shaitan ("demon") by the common folk of medieval Islam and are depicted as such in the various stories. Many Infernal jinn, including perhaps Iblis himself, were once dark Faeries and many Infernal jinn have dark Faerie counterparts who draw vitality from stories arising out of the activities usually ascribed to demons.

In general, the actions of dark Faerie jinn are impersonal and instinctive. Such entities act in a way that may encourage humans to sin because it suits their role in their chosen story and they feed off the vitality created by such emotions as guilt, greed, cruelty and lust. As such, most dark Faerie jinn are Incognizant or only Narrowly Cognizant — they are unable to change their roles, advance or evolve into other forms (see *Realms of Power: Faerie* for additional details). Infernal jinn, on the other hand, are those creatures who intentionally inspire humans to sin, manipulating them to make them fall.

The distinction between a Highly Cognizant dark Faerie jinni and Infernal jinni is a difficult one — many such Faerie creatures quickly lose themselves to the forces of Iblis. The term "shaitan" confusingly refers to both types of creature and the ambiguity and danger this creates for sahir characters is intentional. The Sihr of a sahir will work on both types of creature, although the actual Realm Lore required for the ritual may be mistaken by the character, producing unexpected outcomes when the summoner fails her control attempt because a creature assumed to be a dark Faerie turns out to be Infernal.

## *Ghula, Faerie*

These dark Faerie jinn may rise from, or impersonate, those who die of thirst in the desert. They seek virile and wealthy husbands. They drain the blood of their husbands as they sleep. Once sufficient vitality has been consumed, the ghula can have a baby. The baby appears to share the characteristics of the human parent, but it is a faerie, a ghula like its mother. Baby ghuls are born with teeth.

The ghulas in a city sneak out of their houses while their husbands sleep. They gather in graveyards to feast, cavort and drain the blood from corpses. In most versions of their story, the husband of a ghula discovers these night meetings, and destroys the nest of ghuls, but cannot bring himself to kill his child. The young ghula grows to adulthood, and tyrannize the city, forcing the man who discovered the ghuls to flee. This old, sick, broken man lives near the town, warning travelers away, and reciting his role in his home's downfall. In doing this, he spreads the fame of the ghuls, which gives them vitality.

A related story says that ghulas are the ghosts of prostitutes, given solid form,



and that they are simpler in their predatory behavior. They merely eat the dead, and lacking fresh prey eat corpses. They use their wiles to lure men of weak faith to hidden places and have a power that causes sleep, allowing them to crush the heads of their victims with stones.

Faerie ghula statistics first appeared in *Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 72.

## *Ghul, Infernal*

An Infernal ghul (fem., ghula, pl., ghuls or ghilan) is a degenerate jinni, a corrupt and cannibalistic creature of the night. They are believed to be descendants of a depraved tribe of primitive jinn given over to the Infernal. Solitary by nature, they haunt cemeteries, garbage pits and slums preying on the weak or feeding off carrion. Hideous to behold, they often disguise themselves in heavy robes as lost travelers, women in distress, or kindly dervishes to waylay travelers with the aid of their pow-

*Illusionary Home:* 0 points, Init –3, Imaginem; This comprehensive use of glamour makes a place look, sound, smell and feel like a suitable home for the role the faerie is playing.

**Equipment:** Perfume, wardrobe

**Vis:** 4 pawns Imaginem, rat skulls

**Appearance:** Ghulas usually look like beautiful women. To attract husbands*,*  ghulas pretend to be wealthy widows or orphans of good family, in need of husbands. Ghulas often pretend to be members of communities displaced by war, as it gives their story verisimilitude. The eyes and the insides of the mouths of Arabic ghulas are always green. Male Faerie ghuls exist, but are the servants of the ghulas, and rarely play the role of seducer. See later for an example of an Infernal male ghul.

Ghulas are not designed as player characters. The version represented here differs slightly from the European ghulasor lamiae originally presented in that she reflects the Arab conception of her as an evil jinniyya. Although a form of Faerie spirit, ghulas are locked in a physical manifestation.



**Infernal Might:** not more than 20 usually **Order:** Furies

**Weaknesses:** Protected Group (individuals that invoke the Bismillah Invocation), Vulnerability (Iron)

**Abilities:** Arabic 5 (deception), Brawl 6 (claws), Charm 4 (trust), Stealth 4 (urban areas), Theology: Islam 1 (jinn). Other Abilities depend on the individual ghul

#### **Powers:**

*Berserker Rage*, 1 point, Init 0, Mentem: The demon can grant anyone (usually itself or its animal companions) the Berserk Virtue, which persists until the target calms down.

*Change Form*, 0 points, Init 0, Corpus or Animal: A ghul can change his physical form at will, to whatever human or animal form he desires. Most ghul are limited to changing form into one type of creature (any human female form, any bird form, any canine form, for example), but more powerful individuals have been known to adopt multiple shapes. The Size of the form is limited to whatever is natural for the species, so a human-sized ghul taking adult human form must be between Size –2 and +2. This transformation is not akin to a magical spell; it is a natural manipulation of the physical matter that makes up the demon's body, and consequently Magic Resistance does not stop physical attacks from shapechanged ghul as there is no ongoing magical effect.

*Endurance of the Enraged,* 0 points, Init 0, Corpus: The ghul do not suffer from wound penalties, except on Defense totals.

*Restoration*, 10 points, Init +0, Corpus: When a ghul uses this power, the next blow will heal the wound he suffered the last time he was hurt. Each use of this power is only good for one damaging blow.

**Appearance:** A common ghul is a tall feral creature, hunched over with overlong arms ending in cruel iron claws. It wears rags or rent robes stained with marrow, blood and dirt from the graves it digs up. More intelligent and magical examples appear more human but still have sharply angular features, prominently pointed or serrated teeth, and long curved nails.

This character guide is for an Infernal male version of the ghul and differs substantially from the similarly named female Faerie ghula earlier. Whereas the latter are female-appearing Faerie creatures that eat their spouses, these Infernal creatures act as primal destroyers and are found more commonly in male forms. The exact relationship between the two types of creature is unclear — Infernal ghul may have evolved from corrupt Faerie creatures or they may simply be different entities that appear to share similar forms and characteristics.

Unlike members of dark Faeriealigned jinn tribes, this ghul is a true ''terrestrial demon'' (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 28) and loosely belongs to the Order of Furies, sharing several of the traits and powers of that class of demons. Unlike most demons and other Infernal jinn, although a spiritual creature, an Infernal ghul cannot assume incorporeal form and does not possess the *Coagulation* power. This example lacks the *Envisioning*  and *Obsession* powers of most common demons but other individuals may have these powers or additional deceptive powers or skills instead.

Exceptional individuals exhibit additional magical abilities over rock and flesh (as *Crafter/Master of Earth* and/or *Crafter/Master of Flesh*), illusions, possession, or they have learned some of the magic of humans (Dowsing, Hex, Malefica, or otherwise represented by the equivalent of a *Duplicate the Magi's (Technique)* power). The most dangerous and feared ghul are those who have gained power over other jinn by learning one of the summoning Arts — Sihr, the Arts Fabulosa, or more commonly, the Goetic Arts of Commanding or of Spirit Summoning.

#### **The Varied Guises of Iblis**

At the troupe's option, different versions of Iblis may exist simultaneously in a saga. In the guise of lesser faeries claiming his name, the character Iblis appears in a number of minor roles in the folklore of the Islamic lands. In some stories he may be the Islamic Devil or embody a great duke of the Deluders, while in other tales he is a powerful dark faerie monarch or a faerie opponent posing as a lesser demon.

One such tale is that of "The Old Woman and the Devil", where a very fallible Iblis is challenged by an old woman to show who is the craftier. The old woman tricks a merchant and his wife, but later undoes the harm she has caused, thus proving that "the devil is no match for an old woman." This lesser Faerie Iblis can only destroy or create strife in the stories, but never undo evil or perform good deeds.

#### **Story Seed: The Dark Sufis**

You may wish to introduce into your saga a misguided Sufi tradition, made up of individuals who respect Iblis for his refusal to bow down to Adam, assuming that it was his love for Allah that motivated his decision not to bow to anyone but his God. Such heretical mystics could comprise a Misguided Infernal Tradition of unwitting diabolists similar to the Luciferans. The mystical powers of such Infernal Sufis could be reflected by the Favoured Abilities: Incantation, Effusion, Phantasm and Ceremony. (See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 127–131). Posing as a holy man, a Dark Sufi may contact a Criamon character, seeking to lead the magus into corruption.



Most people are not aware of their qareen; the following creature is appropriate for those who have the Major Story Flaw Plagued by a Supernatural Entity (Qareen). These characters have qareen that they are consciously aware of, that they can see, and that actively try to cause them to stray from the path of good. Less obtrusive Infernal qareen may be reflected by either the Impious Friend or Manufactured Ignorance Flaw, and have Might scores in the range of 5 to 10. An affected individual hears whispers from his qareen, using its Envisioning Power, and such comments appear to come from the victim's own head (and should be provided as advice from the storyguide with nary a mention of a demon involved).

**Order:** Tempters (Shaitan */* Qareen) **Infernal Might:** usually 15 (Vim) **Characteristics:** Int +1, Per +1, Pre +2, +3, Str na, Sta na, Dex na, Qik +2 **Weakness:** Protected Group (victims who willingly and totally reject the qareen, fueling the rejection with a Faith Point), common jinni Weak-

**Abilities:** Vary for individual qareen and may complement those of its companion. In general, a qareen may have up to 300 XP of Abilities that it may use to aid or hinder its chosen human.

nesses (see later).

#### **Powers:**

*Apparition*, 1 point, Init 0, Imaginem; Qareen may assume an illusory form that only their companion can perceive. To the victims, the form appears to be a real person in all respects.

*Control Human*, 2 points, Init +2, Mentem; If this power penetrates, the qareen exerts direct control over its companion. It can issue commands that the target carries out to the best of his abilities. However, the target can attempt to break the control of the jinni every time he is asked to do something contrary to the tenets of his faith.

*Envisioning*, 1 or 5 points, Init +2, Mentem; This Power allows the qareen to appear in the dreams of its sleeping companion (in which case it costs 1 point), or make the target experience a waking dream or vision (in which case it costs 5 points). The qareen cannot instantly make substantial changes to a dream, but instead gradually twists it to take on a darker and more frightening tone, and can speak through any figure from the victim's subconscious. A waking dream is more obvious; the victim suffers an immediate and powerful hallucination of whatever the demon desires. This may be so frightening that the victim is stunned for a round, and must make a Brave Personality roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or have an extreme reaction, such as retching, convulsions, or abject terror. This is the preferred way for a qareen to communicate with its chosen companion.

*Protection of the Appointed Companion*, 0 points, Init +2, Mentem; The companion of a qareen cannot act directly against it without extreme provocation; it would be akin to attacking one's own mother. The victim may be as angry as they like with the jinni, but actually physically opposing it requires a huge effort of will, and the expenditure of a Confidence point, which must be repeated every time the victim wants to renew his attacks.

**Appearance: A** qareen is an incorporeal spirit, appearing to those with Second Sight or means to see the invisible as a pallid reflection of its chosen companion. To its victim, a qareen uses its powers to appear either pleasing or terrifying depending on its motivations and schemes. Unlike many other demons, it lacks the *Coagulation* power and cannot form a physical body.

ers of deception and mimicry.

All ghuls can assume the form of at least one scavenger native to their area, dog, hyena, jackal or vulture, and excel at assuming the forms of humans to conceal their debased nature. They disdain weapons and hunt and fight with claw like nails and jagged teeth. Folklore tells that many ghuls, if wounded with a weapon but not killed outright with a single blow, will be healed when struck a second blow, making them dangerous opponents for lone victims.

## *Qareen*

The Messenger of Allah said, 'There is not one of you who does not have a jinni appointed to be his constant companion.' They said, 'And you too, O Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'Me too, but Allah has helped me and he has submitted, so that he only helps me to do good.'

— Ibn Mas'ood

And whosoever turns away blindly from the remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allah) (i.e., this *Qur'an* and adoration of Allah), We appoint for him a Shaitan ("Satan — devil — unruly — defiant") to be a Qareen (a companion) to him.

— *The Qur'an*

*Qareen* is the Arabic name for a spirit believed to be assigned to an individual Muslim as a "constant companion" — a personal tempter, intent on enticing him to sin. According to the hadith, every human has a jinni appointed to accompany him through life and test him, tempting him away from the path of God. Considered part of the tribe of Shaitan, such qareen are dark Faerie creatures akin to the shedim demons of Judaism (*Realms of Power: Infernal*, page 57). Most characters are unaware of their qareen, but some have more irksome companions reflected by possession of Major Story Flaw Plagued by Supernatural Entity (Qareen), or possible the Minor Story Flaw Faerie Friend. Most of these jinn are playful and mischievous rather than corrupting and provoke stories of temptation, reflection and forbearance. Nearly all qareen belong to the Faerie Realm, but some


have become corrupted and have become aligned to the Infernal, transforming into true demons. There are no Divine or Magic Realm aligned qareen.

Each of these companion spirits has slightly different powers but shares the typical Weaknesses of jinn (detailed earlier). Examples of the powers of an Infernal qareen are given later — Faerie qareen have almost identical base powers, only a differing Realm alignment and motivation for testing their chosen victim. Unlike many other jinn, a qareen cannot assume physical form as they either lack the Coagulation power of most demons or the Donning the Corporeal Veil power common to many faeries.

Some qareen have additional powers — the qareen that accompanied the ancient Arabian *kahin* (pre-Islamic "seers") are believed to possess the following powers or their Faerie equivalents: *The Serpent's Oracle, Trust of the Innocent* and *Forked Tongue of the Serpent* — powers normally attributed to the Spirits of Deceit (See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 38).

A qareen is left powerless if its victim makes a concerted positive effort to throw off the malevolent jinni's influence. This requires the spending of a point of Faith (perhaps a point of Faith acquired by repenting of the sins committed while influenced by the qareen). Confidence alone is not enough to shake off the influence of the companion shaitan, unlike the Jewish shedim*.* In effect a qareen is a special form of Infernal or Faerie genius loci with a locus linked to its assigned human companion allowing it to travel the world.

#### **Wizards and Qareen**

Islamic sahirs are keenly aware of qareen and many have the ability to perceive the true form of their accompanying tempter, either through Second Sight or their other magic. Most qareen accompanying wizards are malevolent, reflected by the Flaws detailed earlier. As jinn*,* they can be coerced with magic, bargained with and even imprisoned using the appropriate supernatural powers, but at the sahir's own risk. See Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman for further details on sahirs and their potential to form magical khadim bonds with qareen that allow them to boost their

## *Story Seed: A Pious Companion?*

Rarely, an exceptionally pious character may be able to convince her dark Faerie qareen to accept the error of his ways and appear to submit to Islam. As all Faerie-aligned jinn, even Faerie members of the predominantly corrupt jinni tribes such as Shaitan, have been granted free choice, this is a potential long-term story option. Such benevolent qareen become the equivalent of highly cognizant Faerie guardians. Being pious jinn rather than true Divine spirits, their power is aligned to the Faerie Realm and not the Divine Realm, although they may be mistaken for guardian angels by the unwise. Infernal qareen, as they are true demons, do not have free choice and so cannot be redeemed.

#### **Submitted Qareen**

*Major Supernatural Virtue*

Your Faerie qareen or accompanying jinni has submitted to Islam. Like a variant Ghostly Warder (**ArM5** page 94) it can guide and assist you with its powers, but cannot provide general Magic Resistance, as it is not a creature of the Divine or Infernal realms. Such qareen can easily be designed using the Ghostly Warder (**ArM5** page 193) or else created as Companion-level characters using the rules for creating Faerie Characters (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 43-63), typically possessing the following Virtues & Flaws: Faerie Speech, Highly Cognizant, Lesser Power x2 (Eidolon, Guide); Intangible Flesh, Negative Reaction.

## *Story Seed: An Unwanted Guest, and an Unexpected Invitation*

Although Christian, Jewish, or pagan summoners native to Islamic lands may also possess a qareen*,* at the troupe's discretion, a Hermetic magus may discover upon arriving in the Mythic Middle East that a Faerie qareen has attached itself to him, despite his status as an unbeliever. Magi with the Spirit Familiar or the Theurgic Spirit Familiar Mystery Virtues (*The Mysteries: Revised Edition,* pages 66–69, 81–82) can attempt to bind Infernal qareen as their spirit familiar but only magi with Faerie Magic can bind submitted qareen or dark Faerie qareen. Demonstration of power over a qareen is sufficient grounds for membership in the Order of Suleiman and the character may find himself the recipient of a cordial invitation to join a group of openminded sahirs.

Solomonic magic by drawing on the reluctant jinni's Might*.* Qareen do not make the greatest candidates for the khadim bond but many young sahirs see the magical servitude as a means of making the most out of the pestering spirits.

## *Jinni Weaknesses*

Bismi-llāhi ar-raḥmāni ar-raḥīmi! (In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful!)

— The opening invocation common to all but one sura of the *Qur'an*

Faerie-aligned jinn possess a weakness to the Bismillah Invocation, reflected by their Traditional Ward Minor Flaw (Bismillah Invocation) and all Infernal jinn have an equivalent Vulnerability to this folk practice of "naming," the invocation of God's name that opens most chapters of the *Qur'an*.

Faerie and Infernal jinn cannot act against an individual who has uttered this phrase before encountering the spirit, similar to the Protected Group Weakness of demons — none of their Supernatural Powers work on these individuals, and they can only defend themselves in combat if attacked (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*,


page 34). This protection has a conditional duration of Until (leaves immediate locale of the jinni or completes a specific action) or until the time of the next daily prayer, whichever is sooner.

To pronounce the Bismillah correctly requires a poetic grasp of the language of the *Qur'an*, reflected by an Arabic score of 6 or more and a successful Com + Theology: Islam stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 6. The Bismillah can only be invoked prior to recognizing a jinni and is ineffective if the character is surprised by a jinni.

Devout Muslims are instructed to utter this phrase before entering locales where jinn are believed to live such as ruins, lavatories, cemeteries, deserts, and caves, but only those with the required fluency in Arabic and a decent grasp of Islamic theology can actually benefit from this magical protection.

#### **Other Folk Traditions That Ward against Jinn**

Arab folklore abounds with additional folk remedies for jinni curses and powers. Many lesser jinn are affected by the Minor Flaw Vulnerable to Folk Tradition (see later) or suffer from the Vulnerable Magic (mu'addhin's call) Major Flaw, their magic expiring at sunrise with the crow of a cockerel or with the morning call to prayer from the minaret of the local mosque. Muslim characters may use either the appropriate Realm Lore or their Theology: Islam score to try to dispel the malign effects of such jinni enchantments. Magic jinn are not so severely affected, but a properly worded invocation of the Qur'an can grant some protection against their powers.

The following four suras of the *Qur'an*, known as the "Four Quls" (each begins with "Say:") are effective wards against jinn and perhaps other spirits each provides a +3 bonus if successfully recalled when invoking the Khawass al-Qur'an as a holy forebearer for the baraka *Acknowledgement of Evil, Celestial Immunity, Expel Demons* or *Resist Temptation* (See *Realms of Power: The Divine,* pages 103–105, for details of baraka). The four specific suras are: *al-Mu'aumidhatayn* (the *al-Falaq* (113th sura) and *an-Nas* (114th / last sura) pairing), *al-Kafraa* (109th sura) and *al-Ikhlaas* (112th sura).

The *Ayat al-Qursi* or "Throne Verse" (255th verse) of *al-Baqarah* (2nd sura) and the last two verses of the same sura are similarly potent wards against jinn. A Muslim character who has memorized and correctly recites 50 ayat (verses) of the *Qur'an* receives the same benefit.

Each sura takes a considerable amount of time to recite and requires the individual to have memorized and the recall the specific verses using their Art of Memory or Theology: Islam score (see *The Mysteries: Revised Edition*, pages 25–26). Characters with an Arabic score of 6 or greater gain a +2 to their roll.

#### **Jinn and Other Expressions of the Divine**

Due to their strong cultural allegiances, all Faerie and Infernal jinn are vulnerable to other strong expressions of the Islamic faith. No such jinn can use their powers to affect a *hajji*, a Muslim who has completed the pilgrimage to Mecca within the last year (see Chapter 1: Introduction and Saga).

A Muslim character who focuses his prayers through correct recital of a sura of the *Qur'an* and who successfully invokes God's aid to defeat a jinni (See *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 41) gains twice the usual bonus.

Faerie jinn are strangely unaffected by other religious demonstrations — Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian — whereas Infernal jinn as demons may be affected by such holy displays. Infernal jinn remain susceptible to the *Scourging the Infernal* power of relics but simple objects of faith have no special power over these creatures (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 33-34).

Unless otherwise noted, Magic jinn are not susceptible to these restrictions but may suffer other flaws reflecting a vulnerability to the power of the Divine. Whether these vulnerabilities stem from the power granted to Suleiman over their ancestors or the apparent conversion of large numbers within the jinni tribes in recent times is unclear.

# *Lands of the Jinn*

The following locations are particularly associated with the jinn*.*

## *Jinnistan*

The jinn dwell in places just past the ken of humans — out of the corner of the eye, behind the doors impossibly squeezed between two seemingly normal houses, or just around the last corner of one of the alleys leading off the bazaar. They visit the mundane realm often but their real homes may lie underground, amid the beauty of the wilderness, within dark ruins or even beyond the mundane realm in regiones and the Supernatural Realms. All these locales are collectively referred to as Jinnistan.

Judging from the tales, although it may once have been part of the Magic Realm, Jinnistan may now lie mainly in the Realm of Arcadia, but seems to have branched into the Realm of Eudokia and perhaps even into parts of Hell. Its geography is as varied as the mundane realm and its inhabitants pursue lives similar to their non-magical brethren of the Mythic Middle East, often passing freely between their magical homeland and their mundane neighborhood.

Whole cities of jinn, such as Amerabad, the City of Amber, are found within its fluid borders and parts of other lost and legendary cities such as Golden Baghdad (see Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia) and Khashgar, the nexus of the fabled Silk Route (see Chapter 9: On the Silk Road), form a background for many of the tales involving jinn. Some travelers claim that Jinnistan can be reached by traveling beyond the Great Rivers, the eastern mountains or sailing beyond the edge of the ocean.

These claims are all true, but false all the same. Where there are jinn*,* there is Jinnistan.


#### **The Mountains of Qaf**

Muslim folklore describes this chain of peaks encircling the known lands, forming a barrier between the lands of the humans and the supernatural homes of the jinn. Impassable, foreboding, and purportedly emerald green in color, mundane geographers have attempted to place this mythical site variously in the Caucasus, the Pamir, the Paropamisadae and even the distant Urals or the Atlas Mountains of North Africa.

Classical scholars equate this range with the legendary Mount Imeon or the Caucasus Indicus of the Greeks — the great eastern barrier of the world of Alexander the Great (see Chapter 9: On the Silk Road).

Perhaps the Qaf are not one mountain chain but are the Essential mountain range, the embodiment of the concept of mountains within the Magic Realm, past which lie whole different worlds. Alternatively, they may be the Faerie Realm's distillation of all the tales of impassable mountains told since antiquity.

#### **Al-Khadar**

Outside the circle of the known world, past the pale blue waters that line the coast of Persia and beyond the trade waters of the Erythraean Sea, lies the great ocean of Al-Khadar ("the Green"), a magical and metaphorical barrier breached only by jinn, adventurers, sorcerers, and Islamic saints. Few claim to have traveled to its distant shores or floating islands laden with human-headed trees and intelligent apes. Those who claim to have returned report their ordeals in allegory and lies, such as in the travels of Sinbad the Sailor.

Islamic cosmology speaks of whole worlds beyond that which contains Mythic Europe and the Mythic Middle East — worlds inhabited by fearsome angels, strange humans, exotic jinn and even more alien beings. Hermetic scholars of the Keeper of Tales mystery cult suggest that these lands lie within the Faerie realm of Eudokia.

wishing to travel into the mysterious Magic Realm, claiming its metaphorical tone contains a pathway that leads outside the Circle of Time.

## *Mortal Scions of the Jinn*

An exotic Merinita maga, Arabian Ex Miscellanea magus or hedge wizard hailing from the Mythic Middle East possessing a jinni variant of Faerie Blood or Strong Faerie Blood (see later) may make an interesting character to play in an Arabian saga. Designed with a suite of accompanying themed powers, such a character may also be played as an exotic outsider in a game set in western Europe. Such characters may possess only a jinni*-*themed Faerie background or may have a whole collection of Benedictions and other powers ruled by Charms with a jinni flavor. All the Virtues and Flaws used in the descriptions of Faerie jinn earlier could be suitable for such a strongly themed character. Such characters would be susceptible to Faerie Calling through Warping, unless specifically created as a Hermetic magus. In this case, they suffer Wizard's Twilight instead. Further ideas and details on such jinni-themed Faerie touched characters can be adapted from *Realms of Power: Faerie*, Chapter 5: Touches of Faerie.

The paragraphs later describe some optional jinni varieties of the Faerie Blood Virtue — adding new varieties to those found on page 42 of **ArM5**. The specific benefit of possessing Faerie Blood of each type is listed, along with the enhanced version for those characters that have the Faerie Legacy Virtue. Note that this enhanced effect replaces the normal benefit of Faerie Blood; it is not in addition to it. Each listing also has some typical Sympathies, and some suggestions for other Virtues and Flaws possessed by different faerie bloodlines. Finally, since characters with Strong Faerie Blood gain a distinctive appearance from that Virtue some common features are given; these could also be used for characters with regular Faerie Blood who also have the Disfigured Flaw.

Further information on Faerie Blood, Faerie Legacy and Faerie Sympathies can be found in *Realms of Power: Faerie,* Chapter 5: Touches of Faerie.

#### **'Afrit Blood**

The 'afrit are ranked among the more powerful of the jinn and many have monstrous oversized appearance and a cruel nature. Although not necessarily evil, they are often indifferent to humans or consider them inferior.

**Benefits:** +1 to Strength or Intelligence, but not to more than +3

**Legacy:** +1 bonus to Strength or Intelligence, can go as high as +4

**Sympathies:** Power, Cruelty, Patience (negative)

**Other Virtues and Flaws:** Greater Benediction: Flight, Greater Immunity: Weapons (bludgeoning *or* piercing *or* slashing), Ways of the Desert; Frightful Presence, Huge, Large, Second Sight; Monstrous Appearance; Faerie Heritage, Susceptible to the Divine, Vulnerable to Folk Tradition (naming or Bismillah Invocation)

**Appearance:** Tall or large in girth, often horned, reddish complexion

#### **Ghula Blood**

The ghulas are rapacious wasteland faeries of the Arab world. Sexual encounters between human men and female Faerie ghulas (see earlier) result in either another ghula (if the child is a girl) or ghul-blooded humans (if a boy is born). The sons of ghulas can then go on to produce either girls or boys with ghul blood. This variety of faerie blood could also represent other violent faerie ancestors. Those with ghul blood are nearly always sinister-looking, born with teeth and unusually aware of their surroundings.

The template reflects a character descended from a Faerie ghula rather than the offspring of an Infernal ghul. Characters born of Infernal ghul may best be presented as Devil Children (see later).

**Benefits:** Claws that can be retracted and extended at will, these have the following weapon statistics: Init –1, Atk +2, Dfn +3, Dam +2.


**Legacy:** As earlier, except that the claws are extra large, and the Damage bonus is +4 rather than +2.

**Sympathies:** Wastelands, Stalking, Compassion (negative)

**Other Virtues and Flaws:** Ways of the Desert; Skinchanger (hyena or vulture); Nocturnal, Poor Presence

**Appearance:** dark skin, wrinkled, sharp teeth, green on the inside of the mouth, always have green eyes.


The jann are lesser Faerie jinn, members of a tribe that closely mimics human culture and behavior to the extent of following Islam, herding camels and living the nomadic lifestyle of Bedouin. As such, they are the most likely type of jinn to produce offspring with Faerie Blood or adopt foundlings into their tribe. Many Faerie sorcerers of Mythic Arabia are believed to


**Benefits:** +1 to Presence, but not to more than +3

**Legacy:** +1 bonus to Presence, can go as high as +4

**Sympathies:** Deserts, Hospitality, Temperance (negative)

**Other Virtues and Flaws:** Supernatural Beauty, Ways of the Desert; Faerie Speech, Persona, Second Sight, Skinchanger (camel, eagle); Envied Beauty; Disfigured (one animal feature), Dutybound (Bedouin honor), Susceptible to the Divine, Vulnerable to Folk Tradition (Naming) or Vulnerable Magic: Mu'addhin's Call

**Appearance:** Swarthy, deeply tanned, piercing blue eyes


Faerie jinn and characters descended from them are well-suited for use as player characters in sagas involving the Mythic Middle East. Such characters could be created as a companion- or magus-level character using the balanced rules provided in *Realms of Power: Faerie,* pages 43–63, and incorporating the suggested inherent Pretenses and Required Virtues and Flaws noted in the sections earlier.

Players wishing to create a character with ties to an elemental jinni aligned to the Magic Realm can design a Mythic Companion, using the Blood of Heroes Special Virtue from *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages* (or the Mythic Blood Virtue for Hermetic magi) or the Magic Blooded Virtue from *Realms of Power: Magic,* and choose appropriately-themed Virtues and Flaws. Some of the Elemental Virtues from *Hedge Magic Revised Edition* may be particularly appropriate for such characters. A Gifted Companion or Mythic Companion Character using the Spirit Votary Major Virtue from *Realms of Power: Magic* could similarly be used to represent a pagan priest devoted to an elemental jinni recognized as a pre-Islamic Arab divinity, perhaps even



claiming descent from such ancient gods.

Mortal characters descended from Infernal jinn or truly demonic jinn are best represented by the rules for Devil Children, given in R*ealms of Power: The Infernal*, page 99–101, and begin with the Devil Child Special Virtue, Demonic Blood and the following starting Virtues and Flaws: Second Sight, Susceptible to the Divine, and Greater Malediction (when he enters a bargain, he is bound to the agreed terms unless its partner reneges first) instead of the usual template listed. Examples of such characters include the whelps of Infernal ghul, children conceived by corrupt shaitan, or the grandchildren of Iblis himself. Repellent is a common Flaw, and some of the more powerful of these individuals have learned various Hedge Arts, including the Goetic Arts of Summoning and Commanding to enslave their pious jinni cousins.

Player character jinn created with a Might Score are susceptible to summoning, dispelling and controlling spells that affect Vim rather than Mentem, regardless of Realm, although it should be noted that magi and mundane companions without Might can be equally affected by Corpus and Mentem magic that penetrates their Magic Resistance, if any.

## *Virtues and Flaws*

This section includes several Virtues and Flaws first detailed in *Realms of Power: Faerie* that are appropriate for Faerie jinn and characters with strong jinni heritage

#### **New and Modified Virtues**

These virtues are appropriate for Faerie jinn characters.

#### **External Vis**

*Minor or Major Virtue, Supernatural*

The faerie's spiritual essence (anchor) resides in one of the props traditional for its role, and this can be carried far from the faerie's body without the faerie suffering ill effects. There is an Arcane Connection between the object containing the faerie's spiritual essence and the faerie's body. If this connection is broken, or the object is destroyed, the faerie's distant body disintegrates, but the essence can construct a new body, given sufficient time. If the vis in the prop is used, the faerie is permanently destroyed.

When selected as a Major Virtue, the prop provides its bearer with any one Minor Virtue, selected at creation. This provides the faerie with a little additional power, but its main advantage is that humans who discover the object are far more likely to treasure it, and keep it safe. This provides the faerie with time to form a new physical body and reclaim his object.

As an example, a faerie warrior with a Might of 20 uses his sword as his spiritual anchor. A character that defeats the warrior finds that the sword contains 4 pawns of vis, but also finds that the sword has no Encumbrance and grants a human wielder a +2 bonus on the Single Weapon Ability. The bonus comes from the faerie's Grant Puissance power. If the human keeps the weapon, then eventually the faerie can generate a fresh body, and seek out the wielder and challenge him to a duel.

#### **Faerie Sight**

*Minor Virtue, Supernatural*

This Virtue, which works constantly at no cost to the faerie, is used in conjunction with the Awareness Pretense. It allows faeries to:

- • Tell mundane things from glamorous ones. (automatic success: no roll is required)
- • See the borders of glamour, so that they know which faerie props and territories belong to (automatic success: no is roll required)
- • See Arcane Connections, so that they know which objects belong to a human (automatic success) and which human (if human and object can be observed, automatic success.)
- • Read each other's glamour. Faerie Lore is a body of knowledge that humans learn through experience, so very few faeries have it. (Ease Factor = Might of other faerie/5). Faeries use this ability

- to read each other's glamour to guide their interactions, instead of using Faerie Lore.
- • See mundane things hidden by glamour (Ease Factor = 3 + (Might of Faerie causing the glamour – Might of the faerie attempting to see through the glamour)/5)

#### **Faerie Speech**

*Minor Virtue, Supernatural*

Many faeries have a Pretense called Faerie Speech that they use instead of acquiring human languages. Faeries seem to know the same languages as whomever they are talking to. If speaking to a group that has demonstrated mixed linguistic skills, the faerie may select which language to speak.

This effect occurs whenever the faerie speaks and costs no Might. It is not magically resisted, because the effect only alters the behavior of the faerie. If the faerie has not heard a person from its audience speak, it may only use whichever language it last used with humans. Once its audience speaks the faerie may then converse in the correct language for its audience.

Faerie Speech is frequently given to characters designed as NPCs. Characters designed for possible use by players have this Virtue more rarely, to free up a Virtue slot, but it is still appropriate for a wide variety of faeries.

#### **Reputation as Confidence**

*Minor Virtue, Supernatural*

Some faeries are forced, by their glamour, to live up to their Reputations. These faeries don't have true Confidence, but pretend to have it to such a skilled degree that the distinction does not matter. A faerie with this Virtue gains a number of false Confidence points equal to its highest reputation, and may spend them, one at a time, on rolls that support any Reputation. The faerie regains these points when a human would regain Confidence.

Highly Cognizant faeries may be aware of the link between their Reputation and their need to uphold that Reputation with Confidence; other faeries with this Virtue are not.



These flaws are designed by Ferie jinn characters.

#### **Intangible Flesh**

*Major Flaw, Supernatural*

The character is immaterial, and cannot physically influence the world. Characters with this Flaw should consider the Eidolon and Loosely Material powers.

#### **Traditional Ward**

*Minor Flaw, Supernatural*

If a taboo is selected as a Minor Flaw then the faerie may not touch a thing protected by the ward with its glamour. The faerie is likely uncomfortable in the presence of the ward, but is not compelled to flee. The faerie cannot regenerate Might points in the presence of a traditional ward. If forced to touch the ward the glamour holding the faerie's body together begins to break down: their body begins to flake away. Prolonged contact with the ward destroys the body of the faerie by unpicking the glamour holding its body together.

This may appear to humans as if the ward is burning the faerie. The damage to the faerie's body can be simulated with the Heat and Corrosion rules found on page 181 of **ArM5**. Assume that the object acts as a source of damage with an intensity of +6.

If a faerie receives an Incapacitating wound from an item that is a Traditional Ward, then in addition to the usual effects of Incapacitating wounds (**ArM5**, page 178–179) the faerie cannot spend any further Might points. It can still activate powers with a zero cost. If the character has constant-effect powers with a nonzero cost, they expire at the next sunrise or sunset and cannot be reactivated until the character is no longer Incapacitated. The character may heal at a human rate, or may remove the injury with an appropriate story event.

#### **Monstrous Appearance**

*Major Flaw, General*

Something about the character looks strange and frightening to others, giving the character a –6 penalty in all social situations where its appearance is a factor.

#### **Sovereign Ward**

*Major Flaw, Supernatural*

If a taboo is selected as a Major Flaw the faerie may not harm a person or thing that is defended by the ward. "Harm" is defined very broadly in the faerie's glamor. A faerie that is vulnerable to religious symbols, for example, can not work around the symbol by putting mundane poison in the food of the wearer, or burning his house down around him. The person is completely safe from the faerie. The faerie must attempt to flee the ward, and its body is destroyed instantly by the ward's touch.

#### **Vulnerable to Folk Tradition (Islamic)**

*Minor Flaw, Hermetic or Supernatural*

The being's magic is susceptible to various folk-remedies for averting hostile spells. Any target that is aware that the creature has just used its magic may attempt a folk ritual, such as making a sign against evil, spitting, and so forth. This grants the target or targets a Magic Resistance equal to (5 x the target's appropriate (Realm) Lore or Theology: Islam), or 0 if the target does have either of these Abilities, against the being's magic only. Furthermore, someone with the appropriate (Realm) Lore or Theology: Islam may be able to devise a manner to break a lasting enchantment, such as plucking nine hairs from the tail of a cat and burning them in an enclosed room with a possessed victim; this typically requires an Intelligence + Ability roll against an Ease factor of (9 + the spell effect's magnitude) or greater.


## *Chapter Five*

# *Mythic Zoroastrianism*

The religion of Zoroaster is a venerable one and his priests gave their names to the practitioners of magic itself. The followers of Zoroaster, also known as Mazdeans, worship the almighty God Ohrmazd. Mazdeans uphold the tenets of personal honesty and truthfulness.

The Mazdean priesthood, called **mobeds** (in Greek, "magoi"), were once masters of the supernatural arts, commanding angels, spirits and elementals; predicting the future; transmuting the nature of matter; and performing great miracles. They are custodians of millennia of arcane lore and mystic knowledge. The mobeds were once a powerful tradition — their magic at its peak may even have come close to rivaling Hermetic Magic — but they are now greatly diminished.

This chapter details Zoroastrianism in Mythic Europe, its faith, practices and current concerns. It also describes the mobeds and their powers.

# *A Mythic History*

Mazdeanism starts with the birth of its founder, the prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra), over six hundred years before the birth of Christ. Zoroaster was born to the virgin Dughdov and when he was born he laughed rather than cried. He was raised as a priest on the very edge of the Persian Empire.

After a period of meditating on the world in a sacred cave, Zoroaster was visited by God (called Ohrmazd), and from this came the Zoroastrian holy hymns, the *Gathas*. Zoroaster spent the next ten years preaching his new faith, traveling as far as the rising sun in the east, and throughout Persia. At age 42, Zoroaster converted the great Persian Emperor Vishtaspa after performing a great number of miracles. Zoroaster was murdered in the city of Balkh by warriors of the Turanian Tribe while he prayed at a fire temple.

With imperial patronage the Mazdean faith, under the guidance of Zoroaster's discipline Osthanes, quickly grew to become the preeminent faith in Persia. The priests of Ohrmazd were known as mobeds, and they held the secrets of Zoroaster: how to understand the movements of the heavens, control spirits, and unlock the secrets of the natural world.

Under the Achaemenians and Parthians, the mobeds expanded their religion and practices into the west, and many great philosophers from the Hellenic world traveled to learn the secrets of the Zoroastrians.

A downturn for the faith came with the invasion of Persia by Alexander the Great. Temples, sanctuaries, and icons of the Mazdeans were plundered and destroyed. The priests who defended their holy places were slaughtered; their scriptures were burned. The Seleucid period



that followed this time was one of despair for the Mazdean faithful. Persecuted, they saw their temples turned over to false gods, devils, and magical spirits. Their holy teachings were dispersed throughout the world for the impious and unbelievers to read and use.

The Zoroastrians regained their strength under the Sasanids, and came into conflict with the powerful Roman Empire and the Mercurian priests. During this period, the Mazdeans and their priesthood were in furious conflict in the western provinces with the Mercurians of the Roman Empire. Mobeds marched with Persian armies in Syria and Palestine, calling down angels and spirits, and giving their generals prophecies and visions of the future. These conflicts, however, were peripheral to the true struggle of the mobeds, which was principally a war against the followers of Ahriman, the Mazdean Devil.

#### **Zoroastrians under Islam**

The rise of Islam in early seventh century spelled the end of the Zoroastrian dominance of Persia. Large numbers of Mazdeans converted to Islam after the defeat of the Sasanid Empire by the Islamic armies. This conquest is known among Mazdeans as "the ruin and devastation that came from the Arabs."

For the Muslim overlords of Persia, Ohrmazd is one and the same as the God of Abraham; the Zoroastrian scriptures are in the same category as the Torah and the Gospel, and Mazdeans are considered "people of the book" (*dhimmis*). Zoroaster himself is thought of as a prophet. Despite this, a large body of laws has been instituted to enforce the social and legal inferiority of the dhimmi in the community. Zoroastrians particularly are (unofficially) discriminated against, called *gabars* ("infidels") and accused of fire and devil worship. Over the years many Zoroastrians have converted to Islam.

Most Zoroastrians who have not converted have moved to remote and poor areas of south central Iran. Increasingly they are migrating further east to unknown lands. Despite this, Arabic has not displaced the local language, and the Iranians maintain distinctly Persian cultural practices. The ancient glories of the Achaemenian era, and the heroes who antedated the first Persian Empire, were preserved in countless tales, poems and stories. The Persian national epic *Shahnameh,* written by the poet Ferdowsi in the 10th century, is still widely read and recited in the 13th century, and details the mythological and historical past of pre-Islamic Persia, including a history of Zoroastrianism.

## *The Mazdean Church*

For much of the history of Mazdeanism, there existed a religious institution, composed of hierarchies of priests supported by the emperor. It was not until the high priests Tanser and Kartir under the Sasanids that there existed a formal Mazdean Church with an explicit hierarchy under the direct theological and spiritual rule of the high priests.

The mobeds that ran the Mazdean Church also engaged in the suppression of rival "false" faiths that were prevalent in the empire, including Christianity, Manichaeism, Judaism, and other exotic faiths from the lands to the east. This practice continued until the end of the Sasanid dynasty.

The Mazdean Church was as thoroughly destroyed as the empire that supported it, although the institution of the priesthood survived. The priesthood is hereditary, rather than open to any who wish to become priests.

The remaining institution is collegiate in nature, with no single prelate to firmly resolve doctrinal disputes. As the Mazdeans are so few, so dispersed, and mostly persecuted, there are few theological or doctrinal disputes of significance.

## *A Note on Historical Accuracy*

Zoroastrianism is one of the least well-known world religions; translations of its ancient texts are contradictory and their interpretations open to debate. Textual and archaeological evidence is scant, and there is little consensus among historians and theologians on many elements of their history or beliefs.

Zoroastrianism is also a living faith, undergoing internal debates about its own origins. The history of Zoroaster, the religion he founded and the nations that adopted that faith as their state religion is open to debate and interpretation. This chapter seeks to be respectful to this venerable living faith and its adherents. This is also a gaming resource, so the most "mythic" of the various legends, histories and interpretations are more often than not used as authoritative.

#### **A Note on Names**

Zoroastrian names have at least four differing versions: the old Avestan, Middle Persian, Parsi (the Persian spoken in the 13th century), and Latinized names. This chapter uses the Avestan names more often than not, but the Parsi names are given in parentheses where appropriate. Some figures, such as Zoroaster, have their Latinized names only. "Zoroastrian" is used interchangeably with "Mazdean".

# *Mazdean Faith*

*Humata, hukhta, huvarshta*  ("Good thoughts, good words, good deeds")

— Mazdean saying

Mazdeans worship a single, all-powerful creator called Ohrmazd ("Wise Lord," *Ahura Mazda*), who is opposed by Ahriman ("Destructive Spirit," *Angra Mainyu*). Ohrmazd is the source of all creation and all good things that exist, and is transcendent. Ahriman is the embodiment of every evil thing and concept.

Zoroaster preached a very high standard of personal morality that binds the laity and priesthood alike; actions taken in this life form the basis for reward or punishment in the next. Collectively, the


actions of the faithful can bring about cosmic changes: the triumph of good over evil. Zoroaster's teachings stress personal honesty and harmony with society.

The material universe is God's good creation, and all unpleasant aspects of it, such as plagues, cold and drought, are products of Ahriman. Because there is a danger of physical corruption in the world, elaborate steps are taken with rituals and practices designed to maintain purity. These rites purify the body and the soul. It is in the material world that humanity makes its choices for right or for wrong. There is no rejection of the material world as being a source of sin or evil in itself. The world is to be enjoyed, although in moderation; asceticism has no place in the Zoroastrian faith.

## *Ohrmazd*

My sixth name is Understanding; my seventh is Intelligent One; my eighth name is Knowledge; my ninth is Endowed With Knowledge; my twentieth is Mazda [Wisdom]. I am the Wise One; my name is the Wisest of the Wise.

*— Yasht* 1.7-1.15

Ohrmazd is the supreme creator of the world and all the good it contains. The Wise Lord is self-created, omniscient, omnipresent, holy, invisible, and beyond human comprehension. He is neither begotten nor is anyone his equal. As creator of the earthly and celestial realms, he is the dispenser of every material good and spiritual blessing.

Ohrmazd revealed to Zoroaster personally the mysteries of creation, the reality of life and death, and the unseen spiritual powers that dwell invisibly throughout the world. To know Ohrmazd is to live in accordance with his divine will, to offer him praise and worship, to please him in purity of thought, word and deed, and to further his cause by joining his forces against evil.

In **Ars Magica**, Ohrmazd is the God of the Divine Realm, the single all-powerful creator and sustainer. He resides beyond the Divine Realm, and is the same creator worshiped by all other monotheistic faiths,

# *Story Seed: The Accursed Turanians*

The Turanians were a tribe originating from around the Ural Mountains north of the Oxus River. Once considered a holy tribe, the Turanians were led astray by powerful diabolical forces and waged war against the pious Iranians. Zoroaster's murderer, a Turanian soldier called Bratarvakhsh, was granted untold infernal powers and, using sorcery,

raised a massive fortress called the Fortress Arvandasp.

The Turanians were assimilated by the Turks during the seventh century; their diabolical elements were utterly destroyed. Infernal artifacts belonging to the Turanians, including the sword that killed Zoroaster, may still lie hidden in the lands north of the Oxus River.

## *Story Seed: The Demon-Blooded Paladins of Manochir*

The paladins of Manochir roamed Persia before its conquest by Alexander the Great. Legends say that the greatest paladin of the age fathered a white-haired child, a sign of demon blood. The descendents of the demonblooded son were mighty warriors, nearly unstoppable.

When the Persian Empire was conquered, the Order of Manochir was disbanded by Alexander. He ordered that their great arms and armor, including a mace and a belt, be buried in secret in the desert. Alexander also tried to exterminate the demonblooded lineage. Rumors from those of Alexander's troops who carried out his commands say that the mace could kill an elephant with a single blow, while whoever wore the belt was impervious to harm. A cache of these paladins' awesome weapons would be a valuable discovery, as long as they are not infernally tainted.

such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. His worshipers benefit from the Dominion, and those with a personal relationship with him have True Faith.

## *Mazdean Divine Beings*

There are a multitude of divine beings in the Mazdean celestial hierarchy. Most of the angels and even the Ameshaspand (Amesha Spentas) spend a great deal of time both in the celestial Divine Realm and the material world. Ameshaspand, yazdan and Mazdean angels possess the same traits as the angels described in *Realms of Power: The Divine*, Chapter Two.

#### **Ameshaspand**

These are seven personifications of aspects of Ohrmazd, called Ameshaspand ("Holy Immortals"), who represent the highest principles of goodness. The Ameshaspand care for and protect creation. Each is a pathway to reaching Ohrmazd and personifies ideal Zoroastrian qualities.

According to Mazdean teachings, the Ameshaspand are part of Ohrmazd's nature. In **Ars Magica**, however, they are extremely powerful angels representing seven aspects of God; they only act according to the direct will of the Wise Lord and accordingly their every act is miraculous. They are not, however, of the same nature as God. All Ameshaspand, in addition to their other Choirs, are also Archangels.

**Vohu Manah** (*Bahman*): The preeminent celestial being next to Ohrmazd, Vohu Manah ("Good Mind") embodies wisdom. He was the Wise Lord's first creation and he guards the animal kingdom in the material world. He presides over good thoughts and wisdom, and commands divine spirits



## *The Mazdean "World Year"*

According to Mazdean astrologers, there exists a "world year," during which all heavenly bodies complete a full cycle of movement. The "world year" is a cycle of 12,000 years, divided into spans of three millennia. Each span saw the birth of either Zoroaster or one of the three Saviors of the World, and the broad pattern of events was repeated. The year 12,000 is believed to herald the victory of the Third Savior, the Saoshyant, who will complete the final defeat of evil.

Approximate dates are given in AD and BC. The table assumes a birth date for Zoroaster of 650 BC. There is no agreement, even in the Zoroastrian texts, of when precisely he was born.

0–3,000 Ohrmazd, with foreknowledge of need and means to destroy evil, brought his creation into being in a spiritual (*menog*) state. Ahriman, rising from the deep, perceived the creation, fashioned the evil spirits and attacked creation. Ohrmazd cast him down into hell by reciting the Ahunvar prayer. (9619 BC–6619 BC)

- 3,000–6,000 Ahriman lay prostrate. Ohrmazd gave material form (*getig*) to creation, shaping the world in seven stages, with one primeval man, animal and plant. (6619 BC– 3619 BC)
- 6,000–8,969 Ahriman breaks into the material world, polluting it, and destroying the primeval creations. From their seed grew all existing plants, animals and men. The great king Yima reigned over mankind. Many events of Persian myth, legend and epic took place. (3619 BC–651 BC)
- 8,970 Birth of Zoroaster. (650 BC)
- 9,000 Beginning of Zoroaster's Millennium. Zoroaster receives his revelation and begins his proselytizing. (620 BC)
- 9,001–9,969 Time of goodness, followed by slow decline. (607 BC–349 AD)
- 9,970 Birth of first World Saviour, Ukh-

shyat-ereta. (350 AD)

- 10,000 Beginning of Ukhshyat-ereta's millennium. He led the forces of good and overcame evil. A new time of goodness was again followed by slow decline. (380 AD)
- 10,970 Birth of second World Saviour, Ukhshyat-nemah. (1350 AD)
- 11,000 Beginning of Ukhshyat-nemah's millennium, where he will lead the forces of good to victory over evil, followed by period of slow decline. (1380 AD)
- 11,943 Birth of third World Saviour, Astvat-ereta, the True Saoshyant. (2323 AD)
- 11,973 He will bring the work of Frashokereti to a conclusion with the resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and the final conquest of evil. (2353 AD)
- 12,000 History will end. The Kingdom (*Khshathra*) of Ohrmazd will come on Earth and he will reign forever. (2380 AD)

that encourage such things. Those who marry and raise a family are more blessed by Vohu Manah than those who choose an ascetic life. Vohu Manah also appeared to Zoroaster and led him to Ohrmazd.

**Asha** (*Asavahisht*): As embodiment of divine and moral law, Asha ("Best Righteousness") leads the path of the pure to Ohrmazd. The entire celestial realm lives according to the principles that Asha embodies, while the material world gravitates towards him. Asha encourages saintly behavior, nobility of character, and truth. Asha guards the material fire, and thus embodies the highest value of the Mazdean faith.

**Khshathra Vairya** (*Shahrevar*): This Ameshaspand embodies the realization of heaven on earth, the "Desirable Kingdom". Khshathra guards the sky, protects warriors, and presides over metal, which is his symbol. The riches of the world — gems, gold, and silver — belong to Khshathra.

**Spenta Armaiti** (*Spendarmad*): A feminine Ameshaspand, Spenta Armaiti ("Holy Devotion") is believed to be the daughter of Ohrmazd. She personifies devotion, piety, religious harmony, and faith. Particularly pious Mazdeans venerate Spenta Armaiti very highly (in this way, she is held in similar regard to the Blessed Virgin Mary), as she enlightens the mind and purifies the heart. Zoroaster in particularly loved Spenta Armaiti above all other Ameshaspand. She governs the earth, granting bountifulness to the Wise Lord's creations.

**Haurvatat** (*Hordad*): The personification of health, Haurvatat ("Wholeness") is another female Ameshaspand. She governs water, and assists personal salvation and communication with Ohrmazd.

**Ameratat** (*Amurdad*): The personification of immortality and master of vegetation, Ameratat ("Life") is inextricably linked with Haurvatat. The two form a spiritual bond, promoting health, joy, comfort, and pleasure among the faithful.

**SpentaMainyu** (*Spenamino*): Spenta Mainyu ("Good Spirit") is the Ameshaspand of God Himself, the active Holy Spirit. From Spenta Mainyu issues life, light, and beauty. It is through Spenta Mainyu that God actively wages war upon Ahriman. He does so by creating good works and beautiful things, in opposition to the despair and evil created by Ahriman. Some Mazdeans believe Spenta Mainyu to be a part of the Godhead itself, a divine attribute. Like the other Ameshaspand however, Spenta Mainyu is actually a very holy and powerful angel (possibly the same being as Metatron).

## *The Yazdan*

The yazdan (sing., yazad, "Adorable Ones") are Zoroastrian angels and benevolent spirits. Figures such as Marduk and Mithras are yazdan (also called yazatas) of greater or lesser significance. They occupy


the third celestial rank, after God and the Ameshaspand.

There are 40 named yazdan, with the most important of the yazdan, such as Mithras, Haoma, Atar, or Vayu, receiving a hymn or Yasht of their own.

Many yazdan personify natural phenomena or abstract ideas, such as the moon, stars, and winds, or blessings, obedience, and peace. There are two distinct orders of yazdan, terrestrial (*gaethya*) and celestial (*mainyava*), although both have the same function: to grant various blessings to those who invoke them with offerings and sacrifices. Many yazdan are angels, but not all of them; rather, some are Divinely-aligned spirits.

Many of the faithful and their communities have their own yazdan, who are venerated in the same way that Christians venerate saints. Yazdan can be invoked like a saint (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 87), although they cannot be threatened. To invoke a yazata, the invoker must be ritually pure (having undergone the Nahn purification rite, see Rites and Practices, later).

#### **Frohar**

The frohar (both singular and plural; *fravashi*) are the perfect divine spirits of every created thing. For humans, they are guardian angels, although everything, plant, animal, element, even other divine spirits, have a frohar — only demons and beings from other Realms do not have one. The title of frohar is granted by Mazdeans to angelic beings of several different types — the Choirs of the Potentates, Authorities, and Angels. Frohar guide the souls of the dead to the afterlife. They help the sun, moon, stars, and sky move, assist women to give birth, and bestow health upon the faithful. The longest Yasht of the *Avesta* (the Mazdean Bible) is devoted to the frohar.

## *Heaven*

I came to a place and saw the souls of generous people, who walked adorned and were above all other souls in brightness. And Ohrmazd ever honored the souls of the generous, which were bright and tall and strong. And I said: 'Happy are you, who are the soul of a generous person, exalted thus above all other souls.' And it seemed to me praiseworthy.

*— Arda Viraz Namag,* Chapter 12

#### **Reaching Heaven**

Upon death, the human soul (*urvan*) remains with the body for three days. On the fourth, the soul is led by its frohar to the Chinvat Bridge ("the Bridge of the Separator"), which spans a great abyss. Heaven waits on the other side. At the bridge, each person's soul is judged by Rashnu; also guarding the bridge are the yazdan Mithra and Sraosha. If the record of the person's soul balances in favor of good thoughts, words and deeds, then the soul crosses without difficulty to heaven.

If the reverse is true, the bridge narrows to a knife's edge, and the soul is sliced into ribbons as it falls into the abyss of hell.

#### **Limbo**

Mazdeans whose life's words, thoughts, and deeds are equal parts good and bad are sent to *hamestagna* (*hamestakan*, "limbo"). Here the soul experiences no torment or torture, only discomfort.

#### **Resurrection and Judgement**

The blessed souls in heaven wait for the birth and triumph of the final and true Saoshyant ("World Savior"). At his appearance, all the dead, righteous and damned, will rise from on the spot where they died; their bodies will be surrendered from the seas and ground, their bones reformed from the earth, hair from plants, blood from water, and life from fire.

They will gather for the final judgment. The wicked will be condemned to three days in hell; the pure will receive three days in heaven. After three days, all shall be purified, good and evil alike, by walking through molten metal. Every soul will speak the ancient tongue of Avestan and worship Ohrmazd, and life will be restored to its perfect, primal state. This great army will then fight all of Ahriman's demons in the final Armageddon, leading to the triumph of Ohrmazd. His victory will herald an eternity of bliss.

## *Saints and Relics*

The Zoroastrian faith does not have a special category of people considered "saints." They do, however, have a preponderance of holy men and women — great kings, priests, warriors, and so on — who are venerated and invoked in prayers. The faithful prefer to call upon the aid of the yazdan, Ameshaspand, and angels. Similarly, the Mazdeans do not venerate relics, although there are a great many sacred and holy objects. These objects — including statues and inscriptions on walls — are imbued with Faith scores, and some may have other divine powers.

## *The Staff of Yoisht Frayana*

Yoisht Frayana was a descendent of the Turanian apostle of Zoroaster, and defeated the sorcerer Akhtya in a battle of wits. Akhtya had terrorized the Mazdean priests for years, killing them after they failed to answer his riddles. Frayana successfully answered each of Akhtya's 99 questions with the

help of the Yazdan, and cast the sorcerer into hell.

The Staff of Yoisht Frayana is a powerful Mazdean relic, with a Faith score of 5. It has the Acknowledgement of Evil, Celestial Immunity, Expel Demons and Grant Serenity powers (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 88).


## *Fire*

Fire is the central symbol of the Mazdean faith and is the visible sign of Ohrmazd's divine presence. As the symbol of truth (*asha*), fire is highly venerated by Mazdeans. All sacred fires, whether for temple or personal use, must be kept constantly burning. Extinguishing a sacred fire is a grave sin, as is polluting it by dropping unclean objects into it. Only clean, dry wood can be used for a sacred fire, preferably sandalwood, aloe, or benzoin.

The typical Zoroastrian sanctuary is a fire temple, an *agiari* (literally, a "fire place"). It is a square enclosed chapel with grillwork and vents to let the fire's smoke out. The fire rests in an iron urn on a stone dais; the urn is typically filled with sand or ash on which the fire burns continuously. It is maintained by the priests of the temple, who must add wood and say the appropriate prayers five times daily.

Devout Mazdeans visit fire temples on a daily basis, while the less observant only attend on sacred days of the month. In 13th century Mythic Europe, with the Zoroastrian faithful pushed to the edge of the Muslim world, there are only a few temples with fires burning full-time. In their place, many Zoroastrians keep small oil lamps or wood fires burning in the home. This type of fire is the simplest and is called *atesh dadgah* ("fire of the appointed place"). If this fire is used for cooking, then cooking pots must not be more than two-thirds full, to avoid the contents boiling over and polluting the fire.

There are two grades of sanctified or "royal" fire above the *atesh dadgah*: the *atesh adaran* ("fire of fires") and the *atesh Behram* (or *atesh Varahran*, "fire of the guardian Varahran"). The *atesh adaran* is the union of four ceremonially ignited fires. The highest grade of fire, *atesh Behram*, requires combining fires from 16 different sources and takes considerable time to perform the ceremonial lighting.


Mazdeans enjoy the same Dominion as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, with the Dominion aura extending from the sacred flame at the fire temple or from a sacred fire in the home. The size and sacredness of the fire increases the Dominion.

The Dominion aura's rating decreases as the distance from the sacred fire increases, so that the aura ratings are the same in the community as laid out in Chapter One, *Realms of Power: The Divine*. Thus, the highest Dominion Aura is near the sacred fire, decreasing to the borders of the fire temple (or building), with the lower rating throughout the faithful community (the village or town and their fields).

In areas where Mazdeans live side by side with other Divine faiths (Islam for example), their Dominion aura is likely to be in Schism.

**Atesh Dadgah**: Increase Dominion Aura by +1 (max rating 3)

**Atesh Adaran**: Increase Dominion Aura by +3 (max rating 5)

**Atesh Behram**: Increase Dominion Aura by +6 (max rating 10)


Thus spoke the Evil One: 'Neither our thoughts nor teachings nor wills, neither our choices nor words nor acts, not our inner selves nor our souls agree.'

 *— Yasna,* Verse 45

Ahriman is the Zoroastrian Devil. He personifies the Lie (*Druj*), and is leader of the demonic hordes; he embodies every negative and evil thing and concept in the universe. Ahriman pollutes and corrupts the bodies and minds of humans, inflicting upon them disease, deformities and decay, as well as moral turpitude, lies, malicious thoughts, and false teachings. For every good creation of Ohrmazd, Ahriman made an evil one. Ahriman is the same being as the Christian, Muslim and Jewish Devil.

Like the Devil in Christian tradition, Ahriman was not of evil substance, but made a


conscious decision to deny God and be evil. Because he is not omniscient or omnipotent, Ahriman cannot foresee his own final defeat, and because he has no forethought, he cannot know of things to come.

## *Mazdean Devils*

The daevas and all Mazdean demons have the same traits as those in Chapter Four of *Realms of Power: The Infernal*. The daevas are exceptionally powerful demons, with high Infernal Might scores and ranks.

#### **The Daevas**

Created by Ahriman in mockery of the Ameshaspand, the daevas are the unholy arch-demons of evil who oppose and contrast with the Holy Immortals. Together, they are known as the *Druj*, "the Lie". All that is foul and corrupt, vile and harmful is personified by a daeva. Not merely to do with nature or physical corruption, the daevas are also responsible for the darker emotions such as hate and envy.

**Aka Manah** is Ahriman's chief lieutenant and opposes Vohu Manah. He perverts the minds of humans with evil thoughts, and blunts their intelligence and reason. His chief role is to create discord and spiritual disruption. Mazdeans believe that the reason children cry when they are born is because Aka Manah frightens them with ghastly visions of suffering. **Indra** drives humans away from virtuous deeds and thoughts, opposing Asha. **Saura** also delights when the faithful discard the symbols of purity and goodness, although his main activity is to encourage tyranny and anarchy; Saura opposes Khshathra. **Naonghaithya** opposes Spenta Armaiti, and attacks the faith and devotion inside people's souls, encourages disobedience, and opposes faithfulness. **Taurvi** and **Zairich** oppose Haurvatat and Amerertat respectively, causing imperfections and mortality in plants and animals, spreading diseases and deformity, creating poisonous plants and animals, and spoiling food with decay.

## *Story Seed: A Heretical Revival*

The Cult of Mithras was a Mazdean heresy that was popular in the western provinces of the Persian Empire, especially following the arrival of Hellenism after Alexander the Great. Although it was persecuted by the imperial Mazdean priesthood, it had a profound effect on Western mystic practices and beliefs.

In a Mithraeum in Mythic Europe, a Hermetic magus of the Cult of Mithras, perhaps a player's character, discovers a cache of scrolls explaining the historical link between Mazdeanism and Mithraism, as well as suggesting the secret location of the birthplace of Mithras, in deepest Persia.

What would happen if a Hermetic Mithraist discovers the still-living religion of Ohrmazd, and how will they react upon learning the Mazdeans believe Mithras to be a divine spirit?

#### **Demons**

There are 45 named demons in the Mazdean scriptures, all of whom oppose the yazdan and Ohrmazd. The demons assault the faithful, plot, seduce and destroy, kill and torment, and seek at every moment to cause evil. Zoroastrian demons share the characteristics of demons as described in Chapter 4 of *Realms of Power: The Infernal.* 

#### **Hell**

And I saw the blackest hell, dangerous, fearful, terrible, holding much pain, full of evil, foul-smelling. Then I thought that it seemed like a pit, to whose bottom a thousand spears would not reach; and if all the firewood which is in the world were placed on the fire in the most evilsmelling, darkest hell, it would never give out fragrance. Again, as close as eye to ear, and as many as the hairs on a horse's mane, so close and many in number are the souls of the wicked therein. Yet they see not, and hear no sound from one another. Each one thinks: 'I am alone.' And they suffer gloom and darkness and stench and fearfulness and torment and punishment of diverse kinds …

*— Arda Viraz Namag,* Chapter 55

The Mazdean Hell is the abode of all evil rulers, evil-doers, evil-speakers, evilthinkers, and those of evil conscience. Those damned souls condemned to go to Hell are surrounded by demons and evil spirits, doomed to suffer torments and deception for all eternity. Each type of sin attracts its own torments and punishments. Those who commit mortal sins of the flesh, extinguish holy fires, destroy bridges, speak falsely, or give false witness are punished with bitter cold, blazing fire, and foul stenches. Those who deny the good religion are bitten and devoured by serpents. Women who are vain and falsely mourn have their heads cut off and their tongues torn out. People who do not keep themselves purified and clean, or who pollute lakes and rivers, are beaten by demons.

Each individual thus holds the key to his or her own destiny. By choosing to perform evil acts or think evil thoughts, an individual condemns himself to Hell.

## *Mazdean Heresies*

Mazdeanism has had its share of heretical movements. In their time, the heresies were all severely persecuted and repressed by the Mazdean Church and imperial authorities. None survive into the 13th century. Nevertheless, the impact of these heresies, and their relics and monuments, may still remain, lost and waiting to be found. Mazdean heresies including the Zurvanites, who believed that Ohrmazd had a father called Zurvan (Time), and that free will was an illusion, and the Mazdakites, who were ascetics, and practiced poverty.


# *Rites and Practices*

Man's first duty on earth is to profess the religion and to practice and worship according to it; not to turn from it, but to have belief in the Good Religion of the Mazda-worshipers ever in mind; to distinguish profit from loss, sin from virtue, goodness from badness, light from darkness, Mazda-worship from daeva-worship.

— *The Teachings of the Magi*

A great number of ritual practices are performed as part of the Mazdean faith. For pious Mazdeans, their faith is not a set of doctrines or a system of belief, but rather a faith that is lived through its prescribed rites and sets of behavior that shape their lives and endow them with meaning and purpose.

Like all faiths, the level of observance of the rites varies from person to person. Most Mazdeans observe the major rituals and ceremonies of their faith, recite the main prayers and genuinely believe in the tenets of Mazdeanism.

Like the sacraments and other religious rites of other Divine religions, properly performed prayers, ceremonies and rituals have a real spiritual and mystical effect. In **Ars Magica**, purification rituals really do spiritually cleanse the person who performs them, burial rites allow a person's soul to reach the afterlife, and prayers really do result in miracles.

## *Prayers*

The recitation of prayers is a major element of all Mazdean rites. There are hundreds of prayers recorded, although three have special prominence and are used most frequently. Their potency and sacredness is so great that they are recorded in every Zoroastrian library and form a part of almost every ritual and religious ceremony. Their recitation is considered one of the most effective prayers to Ohrmazd.

**Ahuna Vairya**: "Just as God is powerful, so is Zoroaster, because of His power of Asha. The gift of Vohuman is for the person who serves Ohrmazd. Any person who helps the needy shall receive help from Ohrmazd."

**Ashem Vohu**: "Righteousness is good, it is best. According to our wish it is, according to our wish it shall be. Righteousness belongs to Asha Vahista."

**Yenhe Hatam**: "We worship those male and female beings whom Ohrmazd knows are best for worship according to righteousness."

## *The Sacred Cord*

The sacred cord of the Mazdeans (called a *kusti*) is a long woven cord, tied three times around the waist. The cord is central to many of the rituals and symbols of the faith, representing the connection between heaven and earth. All practicing Mazdeans have a *kusti*.

#### **Videvdat**

A major liturgical service of the mobeds, the Videvdat is performed in the fire temple by qualified priests. It takes place between midnight and dawn, with recitations from the Yasna, the Visparad, and the Videvdat (see Mazdean Scriptures, later) to invoke divine spirits and ward off demons. Offerings are made to Ohrmazd and the Ameshaspand to coincide with sunrise.

#### **Purity Rites**

The ritual link between purity and impurity symbolizes each Mazdean's personal participation in the cosmic war against evil. The purification ritual practices and symbolic gestures of Mazdeanism symbolize this struggle on a daily basis.

There are three categories of purification rituals. The most important is the Bareshnum, which is undertaken by each Mazdean at least once in their life. The second comprises three rituals observed on specific occasions: Padyab, Nahn and Riman. The final type of ritual includes various ritual actions to ensure continuous purification, both personal and communal.

All of the purification rituals (excluding padyab and the daily rituals) drive away any possessing spirit, infernal or otherwise and cancel any non-permanent, non-Divine supernatural effects.

#### **Bareshnum**

This rite is required for all candidates for the priesthood, but its function is to regain and maintain ritual purity. It also aids the soul's journey to heaven, and is often performed when someone is about to die.

The ritual itself consists of three ceremonial baths performed with the aid of two priests at a fire temple over a ten-day period; a total of 18 applications of consecrated bull urine (*nirangdin*), sand, and water; the presence of a dog 13 times; and the recitation of various prayers. The candidate similarly meditates, prays, and observes ritual acts during the ten days.

The ritual does not work if any of the ingredients used are contaminated during the ritual's performance, if any impurity enters the fire temple, it rains during the ceremony, or if the candidate dies before the end of the ceremony.

In addition to the purifying effect described earlier, the subject of this ritual also gains a Faith Point, although he only gains it once (the first time), even if the rite is performed again on subsequent occasions.

#### **Padyab**

A simple ablution ritual performed several times a day: in the morning after rising, after answering calls of nature, before taking meals, and before saying prayers. The rite consists of a short prayer formula, the washing of the face and exposed parts of the body (generally hands and feet), and the untying and re-tying of the sacred cord.

#### **Nahn**

A sacred bath purification requiring the services of a mobed, it can be conducted either at home or in a fire temple. It is only performed during the day, and


is observed during the Navjote ceremony, marriage, forty days after childbirth, and on any one day during the Farvardegan holiday marking the end of the Mazdean year. The ceremony involves chewing a sacred pomegranate leaf, drinking a few drops of consecrated bull urine, reciting of the Repentance Prayer, applying unconsecrated bull urine (*gomes*) over the body from the head down, performing the sacred bath, and dressing in a new set of clothes. A longer, more complex purification ritual similar to this is administered to those who are particularly impure — this is called the Si-Shuy Nahn.

#### **Riman**

This purification ritual requires two attendants (one of whom must be a priest), and is only performed on those who have come into contact with corpses in the course of ministering to the dead. It involves chewing pomegranate leaves, drinking consecrated bull urine, and ritually washing. The two attendants must also purify themselves. If the subject is a woman, she performs the ritual behind a partition.

#### **Daily Rites**

When a Mazdean comes into contact with substances considered impure, he or she is rendered ritually impure. Impure substances include hair, skin, nails, blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, and menstrual blood when they leave or are separated from the body. Carrion, rotting flesh, or plant matter, and foul-smelling air are also considered impure. There are thus specific rituals to be performed when cutting hair and nails, sneezing and yawning, urinating and excreting, as well as after sex (the act of which is not impure or sinful in itself, although the resulting excretions are). There are purification acts for purifying utensils, tools, furniture, and rooms.

#### **The Yasna**

The Yasna ("sacrifice") is the most important ritual for Mazdeans, and is performed daily each morning by priests in the fire temple. Performing the Yasna is considered a key weapon in the struggle against evil. This ritual is a priestly function and requires no witnesses or lay participants.

It takes about two and a half hours, and is performed by two priests in a special area in the fire temple called the *pawi*. The Yasna establishes a connection between the spiritual (*menog*) and material (*getig*) worlds, inviting the tangible presence of Ohrmazd and the Ameshaspand to the fire temple.

During the ceremony, Ohrmazd and his angels are reverently invoked, and the 72 chapters of the Yasna are recited as the priests walk symbolically around the pawi. At the end of the ceremony, consecrated haoma is poured onto the floor as an offering to the Wise Lord. The remaining libation and bread is consumed by the priests and other attending worshipers. This consumption mystically links the attendants of the ceremony with the divine forces present.

Once the ritual is complete, the Dominion Aura around the holy fire increases by three points (but not beyond eight), decreasing by one point every five paces from the fire until returning to normal; this effect lasts for only an hour. The priests who perform the ritual and attendant worshipers gain a Faith Point. Worshipers in a state of sin do not get this benefit, and if any of the priests are impure during the ritual, there is no benefit.

## **Birth, Initiation, Marriage, and Burial**

There are four ceremonies that coincide with significant times in a Mazdean's life. There are prayers, purification rituals and devotions coinciding with birth, initiation of a child into the community, marriage, and, finally, burial.

#### **Birth**

Before birth, at the fifth and seventh months, a sacred lamp is lit to ward off demons that may seek to harm unborn babies. Forty days after the birth of the child, the mother is given a purifying bath (the Nahn). A child is taken to the fire temple on his or her first birthday and has ashes from the sacred fire applied to his or her forehead.

The lamps lit in this ceremony increase the Dominion aura in the room the lamp is in, by one point (up to a maximum rating of 3; there is no effect if there is no base Dominion aura, or if the Dominion is already at level 3 or higher).

#### **Initiation**

This ritual, called the *Navjote*, makes a child, aged 12 to 15, responsible for honoring Mazdean religious observances. The child receives his or her sacred cord (*kusti*) and sacred white shirt (*sedra*), takes purifying baths, and makes the declaration of the articles of faith (*fravarane*): "I profess myself a Mazdean, a follower of Zoroaster, opposing the demons, accepting the doctrine of Ahura, one who praises the beneficent immortals, who worships the beneficent immortals. I accredit all good things, those that are indeed the best, to Ohrmazd the good."

A character who undergoes the Navjote receives a Faith Point, which can be used as normal. It is lost if the character performs a significant sin. Additionally, the rites performed in this ceremony have the effect of rendering the child's name unusable as a True Name for supernatural activities, in the same way that baptism does.

#### **Marriage**

The ceremony of marriage is an important religious occasion, involving the bride and groom taking purifying baths, with the ceremony itself happening just after sunset. A procession of priests, officials, the bridegroom, and his family (and sometimes musicians) enters the bride's home; the bridegroom stays outside, where his head is marked in red. After this, he enters and sits before the priest. The bride enters some time later and sits next to the bridegroom, with a cloth hanging between them. Prayers are said, vows are exchanged, and benedictions are made. A sacred fire and candle are present throughout. At the end of the ceremony, there is typically a feast.

The marriage ceremony grants both bride and groom a Faith Point that may be used to strengthen their resolve in the face of adversity or temptation.

#### **Holy Festivals**

Although each day is holy, there are seven special holy festivals in the Zoroastrian calendar, dedicated to each Ameshaspand. Each festival goes for five days. The seventh festival, known as No Roz ("New Day") is the greatest holy festival of the Mazdean calendar, prefiguring the final "New Day" of eternal bliss. Note that the festival dates, although associated with seasons, have drifted significantly from their original dates. The dates are given in Imperial (S) and Ancient (F).

**Festival:** *Maidhyoi-zaremaya* **Purpose:** Mid-spring

**Related Ameshaspand:** Khshathra Vairya

**Related Creation:** Sky

**Dates:** 26 Feb. – 2 Mar. (S), 27 – 31 Mar. (F)

## *Haoma*

Haoma (*hom*) is a sacred plant used to make an intoxicating drink. The drink is made by pounding the leaves and stems of the plant. The plant is so sacred that it has its own powerful yazata to protect and nurture it. When prepared according to sacred principles it increases health and fertility, and can even aid in the pursuit of immortality. Haoma is especially important for many Mazdean purification rituals, prayers, and invocations.

When used in alchemical and herbal potions and brews, haoma grants a +3 bonus for effects that promote health or fertility and for effects that allow the consumer to see invisible, spiritual beings. When used in effects promoting longevity, it grants the character a +5 bonus.

Consumed without mystical preparation, but properly fermented, haoma has mild hallucinogenic effects (temporarily granting the Visions Flaw), increases arousal, and increases strength (character gain a +1 bonus to acts of strength). The effects last between one and three hours.

#### **Burial**

The ceremonies of death and burial are the most difficult, especially for those Mazdeans in Muslim lands, where they are forced to comply with local laws and customs. Traditionally, the corpse is ritually washed and dressed. A dog is presented, so it gazes at the corpse, both to ensure the person is really dead, and to ward off evil spirits (this ritual is called *sagdid*, "dogsight"). The Ahuna Vairya prayer is recited by priests, and then the body is taken to the funerary tower (*dakhma*, "Tower of Silence"), a massive tower-like building exposed to the sun and flesh-eating birds. The bones of the dead are left to dry, and then thrown into a deep well filled with lime and phosphorus.

The soul of a Mazdean buried according to this way (or any Divine ritual) can never be affected by any form of magic. This puts it beyond the reach of Hermetic and other forms of magic.

## *The Mazdean Calendar*

The Zoroastrian calendar has a year of twelve months with thirty days each, with an extra five days inserted after the eighth month in Persia, or at the end of the year elsewhere. There is no seven-day week for the followers of Zoroaster. Each day is dedicated to a divine being, to whom the faithful should dedicate their good actions and thoughts on that day. Each month is also dedicated to a divine being. Consequently, once a month, the day and month have the same name, which is the cause for special reverence. The ninth day of the month, sacred to fire, is favored in any month for visits to the fire temple, but especially so during the ninth month (also sacred to fire).

There has been periodic reform of the calendar to stabilize the months in relation to the seasons, but over the decades and centuries the dates have drifted to become out of sync with the seasons (with no leap year, the day drifts by one day ever four years). This has resulted in different Mazdean communities using different calendars — the Shenshai ("Imperial") and Fasli ("Ancient") — so that they hold their holy days at different times.

During the five days of the holy festivals, the Dominion Aura radiating from the fire temples takes on a nature abhorrent to the forces of Ahriman. Any creature with Infernal Might that seeks to enter the Aura is unable to do so if their Might Score is less than the Dominion Aura x10. Should they succeed in entering the Aura, they suffer an amount of damage per hour equal to the Dominion Aura rating (which can be Soaked as normal). On the final day of each holy festival, the damage inflicted on Infernal beings cannot be Soaked.



## *Mazdean Scriptures*

Zoroastrianism emphasizes its oral traditions and all priests learn the scriptures by heart. The words of Zoroaster were written down over his lifetime to form the *Avesta*. There are many books making up the *Avesta*, many of which have been lost, destroyed or pillaged following the Muslim conquest of the Sasanid Empire. While some fire temples may possess copies of parts — even large parts — the chief role of the priesthood is to act as living scriptures, memorizing every word and prayer.

#### **Avesta**

The *Avesta* contains the hymns, formulas, laws and stories of the Mazdean faith. There are two main parts to the *Avesta*. The *Avesta* is also written in multiple languages, Avestan and "Gathic," a liturgical language for prayers. The Ability Dead Language: Avestan grants knowledge in both. There are translations into Parsi (and other languages, like Latin, Arabic, and Greek), although they are not considered holy.

#### **The Yasna**

The *Yasna* is the chief liturgy of the Mazdeans. "Yasna" literally means "sacrifice", and includes confessions, rituals, prayers, exhortations, praise, and worship of Ohrmazd. The *Yasna* is formed from six *Gathas* (hymns), and has a total of 72 chapters. Five of the six Gathas are considered to be the direct word of Zoroaster himself. The sixth was written by his disciples. (Summa, Theology: Zoroastrian, Quality 4, Level 9.)

#### **The Visparad**

The shorter liturgy, the *Visparad* ("to all the lords") is 23 chapters of invocations, praise, and hymns to Ohrmazd, the yazdan, and the other powerful divine beings, and also includes the seasonal festivals (*gahambars*). (Summa, Dominion Lore, Quality 3, Level 4.)

#### **The Videvdat**

The *Videvdat* (*Vendidad*, "law abjuring demons") has 22 sections containing the religious, civil, criminal, and purification laws of Mazdeanism. It also details the life of Zoroaster and the origins of medicine (medicine by knife, herbs, and sacred rites). (Summa, Theology: Zoroastrian, Quality 6, Level 6.)

#### **The Khordeh Avesta**

Often combined with the *Yasht* (see later), the *Khordeh Avesta* ("Little Avesta") is for use by priests and lay folk in private devotion. It is a summary of the *Avesta*, containing prayers, invocations, and blessings. (Tractatus, Theology: Zoroastrian, Quality 6)

#### **The Yasht**

The *Yasht* ("worship") is a collection of 22 hymns and prayers invoking yazdan and angels. Each prayer invokes only a single being, such as Ohrmazd, each of the Ameshaspand, and the sun, moon, stars, Mithra, and Sroasha respectively. (Tractatus, Theology: Zoroastrian, Quality 6)

# *Mazdean Characters*

Mazdean characters have access to unique Virtues, Flaws, and Abilities, reflecting their faith, culture and society.

## *Virtues and Abilities*

Making a Mazdean character depends on the saga. Sagas set in predominately Muslim or Christian lands would see the Mazdean character take the Outsider Major Flaw. In areas where Mazdeans are a sizeable minority, or even a majority, then the other Social Status Virtues and Flaws can also be taken.


A mobed character may take the Senior Clergy Major Social Status Virtue (see *The Church*, Diocese Chapter), reflecting the character's status as a *dastur* ("senior priest"). This reflects the fact that your character is in charge of several subordinate mobeds, and probably governs a large fire temple.

Mazdeans typically do not take Virtues or Flaws that would make them a monk or nun. To Mazdeans, the world is a wonderful place to be lived in and enjoyed. The fight against evil takes place in society, so being cloistered away and practicing an ascetic lifestyle of deprivation is not in keeping with their faith. There is also no tradition of wandering holy men or women in orthodox Mazdeanism (precluding analogs of Virtues or Flaws such as Mendicant Friar).

## **New Ability: Dead Language (Avestan)**

Avestan is the holy liturgical language of the Zoroastrian Holy Scriptures, used by Zoroaster himself. No longer spoken or written outside of the fire temples, the language is now used purely for sacred hymns and prayers. This ability allows your character to read and write texts in Avestan, and to understand the words of prayers spoken in Avestan.

To write this language (written from right to left), your character must have a score of at least one in Artes Liberales. This Ability is generally only possessed by mobeds.

**Specialties**: Liturgies, scripture, oral tradition, alphabets, myths. (Academic)

#### **New Virtue: Magian Lineage**

*Minor or Major, General*

This Virtue makes the character a true blood descendent of the original Median


tribe of Magians, the original priestly caste of Persia. Many mobeds possess this Virtue, either Minor or Major, but is not a requisite.

**Minor:** Your character's lineage is weak, although he or she is still ethnically Magian, and gains a strong constitution due to his purity. The character gains a –1 bonus to Aging rolls and a +3 bonus to resist the effects of disease.

**Major:** In addition to the benefits of the Minor Virtue, your character has an affinity with the ancient prophetic and other mystical arts of your ancestors. The player must choose three Arcane or Supernatural Abilities which the character need not start play with, and which cannot be True Names. These Abilities are considered connected, so that whenever your character successfully studies one of these Abilities (that is, gains at least one experience point from study), he or she gains an additional experience point in each of the other two.

#### **New Virtue: Mazdean Priest**

*Minor, Social* 

Your character is an ordained Mazdean priest, initiated as a mobed. This means that the character may carry out the various rituals and ceremonies, such as the Yasna, Vivevdat, Navjote, marriage, burial, official prayers, purification rituals, lighting of sacred fires, and initiation of new priests. In Mazdean communities, your character is held in high regard and treated with great respect. The character wears pure white clothes and when performing ceremonies, covers his face with a white veil to protect the sacred flame from his breath and saliva.

As a mobed, your character resides in a community that likely has a fire temple. This means that your character has arduous and time-consuming religious and ceremonial duties. Most of your time is spent praying, performing ritual purification rites and tending to the sacred fire. If you are Wealthy, you have several ervads (junior priests) who perform many of the more arduous tasks.

### *The Cradle & The Crescent*

If you are Poor, it likely reflects the poor station of Mazdeans in the community in general, and you may also possess the Outsider Flaw.

Your character may take Academic Abilities at character generation. You must take the Minor Personality Flaw Vow (**ArM5**, page 60) to reflect your constant state of ritual purity, and dedication to your community. This Virtue is only available to male characters.

## **New Virtue: Knowledge of True Names**

*Minor or Major Supernatural* 

Your character may start play knowing one or more True Names of supernatural beings. Any Mazdean character may take this Virtue, although it is only of use to those characters with supernatural abilities or powers. This Virtue reflects the deep and ancient occult knowledge possessed by the mobeds.

At the storyguide's discretion, this virtue may be made available to other characters, such as sahirs, Hermetic theurgists, infernalists, or Holy Magi.

**Minor:** This virtue grants you 30 experience points to spend on True Names — each True Name costs 5 experience points to learn. Names with fewer than 5 experience points provide no benefit at all, but you can decide to partially learn a True Name by spending fewer than 5 experience points on it. Each True Name is recorded under Abilities as "True Name of (Being)." The character may know the True Names of beings from the Magic, Faerie and Infernal realms. You may take this virtue more than once to gain additional experience points to spend on True Names.

**Major:** The Major Virtue version of Knowledge of True Names is identical to the Minor version, also granting 30 experience points, except that you may also know the True Names of angels and other divine beings. Storyguides and troupes should consider this Virtue carefully before allowing it.

# *The Mobeds: Princes of Magic*

Without a doubt magic arose in Persia, with Zoroaster. On this our authorities are agreed …

— Pliny, *Natural History, 30.2.3*

The priests of Ohrmazd are the mobeds, whose lineage can be traced back to the Median tribe and Zoroaster himself. The mobeds are a holy tradition, with Initiations that grant them unique holy powers.

In centuries past, the mobeds were sages who possessed great occult knowledge. In addition to their holy powers, they had mastered the forces of magic, astrology, alchemy, and theurgy. That knowledge is largely lost in the 13th century, and mobeds are now almost exclusively practitioners of holy powers.

The Mazdean priesthood is hereditary: only sons of a mobed or the male descendents of a priestly family can be considered for priestly office. Needless to say, mobeds are not celibate and may marry.

There are several ranks, and initiations that must be performed to achieve each rank. The lowest rank of Mazdean priest is that of **ervad**. An ervad may perform ordinary services, but none of the important rituals. The ceremony of **martab** initiates a priest to the rank of mobed, a fully qualified priest, able to perform all services and rituals. The highest remaining rank is that of **dastur**, the head of a group of priests of an area or particular fire temple. Higher levels of the priesthood have been lost to time.

## *Zoroastrian Magi*

*Realms of Power: The Divine* gives rules for Zoroastrian holy magi on pages 116–117. Those rules could also provide inspiration for Zoroastrian holy sahirs, although the benefits of Holy Magic would need to be adapted.


## *Supernatural Abilities Taught by the Mobeds*

**Favored Abilities**: Invocation, Adjuration, Wonders, Sense Holiness and Unholiness

**Other Abilities**(not favored): Ceremony, Dream Interpretation, Mythic Alchemy, Mythic Herbalism

Mobed characters are not limited to the Abilities listed here; these are simply common to the societas.

## *New Ability: Mobed Lore*

This Ability is the Organization Lore for the mobeds, and is used for their initiation rituals. This lore does not give any specific knowledge of the Mazdean faith, beliefs, or rituals (this is represented by the Ability Theology: Mazdean), but rather the legends, history, and structure of the priesthood, as well as the specific initiation rites and oral lore of the mobed tradition.

Few mobeds today possess The Gift. This allows them to integrate into society easily and take on influential and trusted roles. A relatively large proportion of mobeds also possess True Faith and may perform miracles. This may be because of special divine favor, or because only the truly devout become priests in a small and oppressed religion.

## *Mobeds in Western Eyes*

To Western wizards and mages, the priests of Zoroaster were an order of seers who were dedicated to the service of the gods who had strong constitutions and lived to a great age, for their profession as magi made it incumbent upon them to observe the strict rules of life.

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

The mobeds are known for their pious study and worship, their ethics, divinations and prophecy, holy learning, and rules of purity.

Few Hermetic wizards would believe that the Persian magoi still remain a living tradition. The relics, scriptures, and holy rituals of the magoi are legend, highly sought after. Zoroastrian texts are considered masterpieces of the magical arts, containing everything from hidden truths of alchemy, to the names of archangels and demon princes. Some Hermetic magi, however, believe their knowledge to have been primitive.

## *Mobeds and the Suhhar Sulayman*

Non-mobed sorcerers before the seventh century were ignored and spurned by the Mazdean priesthood. The non-Mazdean sorcerers of Persia and the Holy Land were no match for the great imperial powers of the mobeds.

This situation was reversed after the seventh century. The Order of Solomon became the Suhhar Sulayman, and the Islamic sages and sorcerers now reign supreme in Persia, while the mobeds are an insignificant force on the periphery of the civilized world. As in the West, their lore, rituals and secrets are greatly prized, and their historical knowledge of the mystic arts of astrology and alchemy is admired, if not associated with the mobeds still living.

## *The Magic of the Mobeds*

Mobeds practice holy powers, although these powers are only bestowed upon those initiated into full mobed rank; ervads normally have no special divine powers. The rank of dastur indicates both a political and ceremonial rank, and also suggests investment of some mystic powers.

Mobeds teach as Favored Abilities the Holy Method Invocation; the Holy Powers Adjuration and Wonders; and the Sense Holiness and Unholiness Supernatural Ability.

Favored Abilities are Supernatural Abilities taught by the mobed tradition, and for which mobed characters do not need to subtract the total of their Supernatural Ability scores from their Advancement Total (see **ArM5**, page 166). Mobeds also teach a range of non-favored Supernatural Abilities, either suffering the penalties or initiating them as a Mystery. Favored Abilities only impact mobeds with True Faith; mobeds without such a connection to Ohrmazd must take the appropriate Virtues at character creation, or Initiate into them during play.

A great number of Mystery powers are available to mobeds, although it is extremely rare for a community of Mazdeans to possess a mobed that knows more than one or two.

Mobeds experience the Divine Ascent in place of generic Warping or Twilight, with Divine Form the most common kind of Ascent.

#### **Mazdean Hedge Magic**

The mobeds are known for their strong alchemical lore; the *Videvdat,* for example, focuses on alchemy and medicine. Mobeds may take the Mythic Alchemy and Mythic Herbalism Virtues (see *Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, pages 81–82) without the need for any further background explanation, and these Virtues are often associated with the Divine Realm, rather than Magic. However, it is not unusual for a mobed to have supernatural powers derived from both realms.

## *Holy Powers*

The Holy Powers taught by the mobed tradition are spectacular and majestic, commanding the forces of nature and creating life out of nothing. When mobeds invoke their divine wonders, they use the sacred names of yazdan and the Ameshaspand; their prayers call upon the aid of the Wise Lord himself. Especially powerful mobeds can even call into existence divine



spirits to perform tasks for them and give them aid.

#### **Casting Score:**

**Communication + Invocation + Holy Power + modifiers + aura + die roll**

If this total is less than the target Level, the effect doesn't happen, but there might be other effects instead, in the form of supernatural retribution. This is called a Tragedy of Hubris. It might manifest as a curse, a loss of ability, fatigue, a physical injury, or even a Flaw. It is also a great opportunity for an appropriate story event. This tragedy usually lasts only until the character has somehow atoned or made amends for his presumptuous actions, though the effects are sometimes permanent, depending on the severity of the transgression.

#### **Minor Tragedy (–1 to –10)**

- • A Method, Power or other Supernatural Ability is halved
- • Gain a Minor Flaw, e.g., Lesser Malediction, Fear, Poor Memory, Simple-Minded
- • Suffer a Medium wound
- • Receive three extra botch dice on all rolls
- • Gain a Warping point

#### **Major Tragedy (–11 to –20)**

- • A Method, Power or other Supernatural Ability is lost
- • Gain a Major Flaw, e.g., Greater Malediction, Blind, or Enfeebled
- • Suffer a Heavy wound
- • Permanently suffer a minor tragedy
- • Gain a Decrepitude point

#### **Ultimate Tragedy (–21 or more)**

- • All Supernatural Abilities are lost
- • Character possessed by a supernatural creature
- • Suffer an Incapacitating wound
- • Permanently suffer a major tragedy
- • A terrible plague, war, or famine affects the entire region

#### **Invocation**

By addressing God and the servants of the Divine, commanding them by their names, and entreating them for aid, your

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

character can cause holy effects to manifest. This might be because God's servants hear your character's pleas and intervene, or because your character's understanding of God's word is such that he can wield God's power using God's voice. This typically relies on Communication, and requires that the character invest Confidence in the effect.

#### **Adjuration**

Adjuration is the Power to summon, control and banish supernatural creatures of all kinds, including dispelling their powers and compelling their cooperation. Through Adjuration, God asserts his ultimate authority over creation and both the natural and supernatural worlds. Adjuration is also the witnessing of oaths and truths, by forcing otherworldly beings to recognize God's authority and obey him. The target might cry out in pain and wonder when affected, or speak in a different voice that represents its true nature for the effect's duration. Invocation is used to compel creatures to act, often forcing them to use their powers on the holy character's behalf.

## *Adjuration Guidelines*

When these guidelines refer to a supernatural creature, it means a specific entity with a Might score.

**Level 4:** Bind a supernatural creature to the terms of a contract. (Invocation)

**Level 5:** Compel a supernatural creature within range to manifest in your presence. (Invocation)

**Level 10:** Compel a supernatural creature to reveal the truth, even a demon; you may ask one question, and if you overcome the creature's Magic Resistance it must answer you honestly. (Invocation)

**Level 15:** Compel a supernatural creature to do your bidding; you may give it one command which it must follow exactly for the duration. (Invocation)

**Level 20:** Compel a mundane creature to do your bidding, as earlier. (Invocation)

**Level 25:** Compel a human being to do your bidding, as earlier. This command must be within the person's nature, as evidenced by appropriate Personality traits. (Invocation)

## *True Names*

Mobeds may learn and use True Names (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 34, and also *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 20). Each True Name is treated as a special Ability called "True Name of (Being)," and costs 5 experience points to learn, and once a True Name is learned, your character gains 1 experience point to the being's associated Realm Lore. True Names grant a +5 bonus to Penetration modifiers, and are of indefinite duration.

Mobeds have access to hundreds of True Names of angels and demons. Characters may start play knowing the True Name of one or more beings (see the *Knowledge of True Name Virtue*, earlier in this chapter).

## *Using Vis*

Mobeds may use holy and magical vis. If a mobed knows certain mysteries, he may even extract vis from an aura. Holy vis grants the same mechanical

bonuses as magic vis. The consequences of profaning holy vis, or using it for diabolical ends can be dire, risking Divine retribution.



#### **Adjuration**

*Major, Supernatural* 

This Virtue allows the character to command and control supernatural beings, and he begins with the Supernatural Ability Adjuration 1.

#### **Dream Interpretation**

*Major, Supernatural*

The character can understand and interpret the secret meaning of dreams. This Virtue gives the Supernatural Ability Dream Interpretation 1, which may be used in place of Meditation to activate Holy Powers and also allows him to interpret dreams of a general nature. Mobeds may take Dream Interpretation, although it is not an Ability favored by their tradition. It may, however, be Initiated into as a Mystery Virtue.

#### **Invocation**

*Major, Supernatural* 

This Virtue gives the character Invocation 1, a Supernatural Ability which

#### **Wonders**

Those who ask properly will receive God's gifts, for God provides for the faithful in need. God also summons storms, fire, winds, and other powerful natural forces. These wonders are created at the holy character's command, and even controlled by him to some extent, although God always keeps His hand upon His miracles. Such things may appear at times to listen to another voice, and act in ways that the holy character does not anticipate.

These effects use Invocation to conjure and command divine forces by their name and purpose. When a character suffers a Tragedy of Hubris with Wonders, he might create unwanted items, such as rotten food, vermin, or mud. Or the effect might still happen, but completely out of his control.

## *Holy Virtues*

The following virtues are appropriate for characters of the mobed tradition.

## *Wonders Guidelines*

**General:** Create a dangerous substance, like fire or poison, that does +(base level of the spell) damage upon contact. (Invocation)

Create a natural substance that harms non-divine supernatural creatures, such as water that corrodes like acid or a light that burns like fire, doing +(base level – 5) damage. (Invocation)

**Level 2:**  Create a mature living plant, or cause a plant to grow more quickly. (Invocation)

**Level 3:** Create and control a common force of nature, such as a gust of wind or a burst of flame. (Invocation)

Create a non-living natural object, such as an animal corpse, driftwood, or a rock. (Invocation)

**Level 5:**  Create and control an unusual force of nature, such as a sudden storm from a clear sky, or a light that shines like the day. (Invocation)

Create nourishing food or drink, enough to sustain a single person. (Invocation)

Create a nonliving object that has been processed in some way, such as a leather coat, a lance, or a coin. (Invocation)

**Level 15:** Create and control a powerful force of nature, such as winds that lift a person off of the ground or a flame that lights up the sky for miles. (Invocation)

Create a living, docile bird, fish, lizard, or amphibian. (Invocation)

**Level 20:** Create a living, docile mammal. (Invocation)

**Level 30:** Create an animal with Divine Might 5. Each 5 points of additional Might increases the Level by 10. (Invocation)


allows him use the Holy Method of Invocation and to roll a stress die for miraculous effects.

#### **Wonders**

*Major, Supernatural* 

The character begins with the Supernatural Ability Wonders 1, which allows him to conjure holy items, creatures, and the elements at God's will.

## *Holy Abilities*

These abilities can be taken by characters of the mobed tradition.

#### **Adjuration\***

The character is skilled in controlling and banishing supernatural creatures and their powers (see Miraculous Effects, later). Specialties: type of creatures (angels, demons, ghosts, faeries), causing a specific effect. (Supernatural)

#### **Dream Interpretation\***

In the Mazdean tradition, Ohrmazd and His servants regularly send messages and prophecies through dreams: Zoroaster received visions and guidance from the Wise Lord on many occasions. Dream interpretation helps mobeds translate the confusing symbolism in dreams to make clear their deeper meaning.

The Dream Interpretation Ability has two uses. The first is a form of Meditation, as per the Holy Method, used in combination with Holy Powers. In this case the character must engage in ritual prayer for an hour before spending a full night in restful sleep. Upon waking the character must spend (6 – Dream Interpretation, to a minimum of 1) hours contemplating the imagery revealed to him in his dream. At the end of that time you roll for the miraculous effect as normal. Note that Meditation cannot be used with Adjuration or Wonders; see *Realms of Power: The Divine,*

## *New Wonders Guidelines*

**General:** Create a sacred spiritual force that that can neutralize the spiritual taint of the Infernal Realm. For example, the force could transform Infernal Warping into Divine Warping (1 Warping Point per level of effect is transfigured), although the Warping itself is not removed. The power can strip the infernal nature of Infernal vis, completely destroying the vis (1 pawn of vis per 3 levels of effect). It can also destroy Confidence Points gained through committing sin (1 Confidence Point per 5 levels); note that doing this causes the target to feel great remorse for the acts they performed to gain the Infernally gained Confidence Points (this does not work against demons, but can work against other creatures with Infernal Might). (Invocation)

Create a sacred force that acts as the Scourging the Infernal power radiated by relics (*Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 45), forcing infernal beings to flee (note that this is an equivalent effect, not a true relic power). Use the level of the effect in place of the Divine Might of the relic when calculating the effect of the aura. (Invocation)

**Level 35:** Create a spirit with Divine Might 5. Each 5 points of additional Might increases the Level by 10. (Invocation)

page 48. However, mobeds may possess other Holy Powers.

The second use is a form of direct divination. In this case the character is interpreting his own dreams or the dreams of others to find answers to posed questions. The dreamer must be prepared, as per the other use of the Dream Interpretation Ability, and upon waking the character again spends (6 – Dream Interpretation, to a minimum of 1) hours contemplating the imagery. You may then make an Intelligence + Dream Interpretation roll. Characters with the Premonitions Ability gain a bonus equal to their Premonitions score.

The Ease Factor is the level of the equivalent Momentary non-ritual Intellego Hermetic spell. Holding an arcane connection to a target is treated as Touch range and the Boundary target does not require a ritual. The usual rules for penetration in **ArM5**, page 184, apply to this Ability.

Most who possess the Dream Interpretation Ability have specific rituals that they believe help them to achieve insight. Some fast before sleeping, some wear ritual clothes while they sleep, while others sleep in graveyards in order to gain the assistance of ghosts.

**Specialties**: Any appropriate Holy Power, own dreams or the dreams of others, dreams had under specific circumstances (Supernatural)

#### **Invocation\***

Using holy words, phrases and prayers, the character can invoke Ohrmazd's power. He must either cry out his prayer in a loud voice, or somehow inscribe his prayer in writing. This adds the character's Communication to your roll, and requires that he spend a point of Confidence (or Faith) to bring the effect into being.

You may also roll a stress die instead of a simple die when calling a holy effect if you wish. By doing so, the character essentially commands rather than entreat God's aid, summoning more potential power but risking giving greater offense should he prove unworthy.

**Specialties**: using holy names, in writing, affecting a particular kind of target. (Supernatural)


#### **Wonders\***

The character can cause living creatures, non-living objects, and forces of nature to manifest through God's power (see Miraculous Effects, later). **Specialties**: causing a specific effect, a particular kind of material, in specific circumstances. (Supernatural)

## *Group Magic*

Mobeds can practice their magic collectively. In times past, when they were an imperial priesthood, hundreds of mobeds would gather to perform great rituals in honor of Ohrmazd and his angels. In the 13th century, few communities have more than a few Mazdean priests and those that do are unlikely to possess the knowledge of such powerful rites.

To perform group powers, mobeds use the Ceremony Ability (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 34–36), and engage in prayers and rituals. Most of these are communal in nature, and so laypeople will often participate (although this gives no mechanical bonus).

## *Holy Mobed Mysteries*

The mobeds have several unique mysteries that are holy in nature (that is, they can only be initiated by a character with Holy Powers or True Faith). Many allow mobeds to wield mystical powers.

#### **Blessing of [Ameshaspand] (Minor Mystery Virtue)**

The mobed with this holy mystery gets a +3 bonus to Casting Scores for holy powers used in the area covered by a specific Ameshaspand (see list). There is a different version of this virtue for each Ameshaspand.

**Ameshaspand:** *Asha Vahishta* **Meaning:** "Best Righteousness" **Equivalent Form(s):** Ignem, Imaginem

## *The Cradle & The Crescent*

**Ameshaspand:** *Khshathra Vairya* **Meaning:** "Desirable Dominion" **Equivalent Form(s):** Vim

**Ameshaspand:** *Haurvatat* **Meaning:** "Health"

**Equivalent Form(s):** Aquam, Auram

**Ameshaspand:** *Spenta Armaiti* **Meaning:** "Holy Devotion" **Equivalent Form(s):** Terram

**Ameshaspand:** *Ameretat* **Meaning:** "Long Life" **Equivalent Form(s):** Herbam

**Ameshaspand:** *Vohu Manah* **Meaning:** "Good Purpose" **Equivalent Form(s):** Animal

**Ameshaspand:** *Spenta Mainyu* **Meaning:** "Holy Spirit"

**Equivalent Form(s):** Corpus, Mentem

#### **Mazdean Alchemy (Minor Mystery Virtue)**

Through Mazdean Alchemy, a mobed may distill vis from a Divine Aura. Distilling divine vis takes a season before the vis is extracted. The character uses as his Lab Total his Intelligence + Invocation + Wonders + Holy Magic + modifiers. Modifiers include the aura, bonuses from Lab assistants and so on. The Lab Total is divided by 10, as per Hermetic vis extraction.

#### **Mazdean Astrology (Major Mystery Virtue)**

This Mystery allows the character to use his knowledge of the heavens to determine the most effective time to pay or use holy powers. The mobed may also use new astrological durations.

#### **Celestial Durations**

No duration may be longer than a year. Failing the calculation roll causes the effect to fail. Botching a calculation roll causes the effect to botch.

**Minutes:** The effect lasts for a certain number of astrological minutes. Equivalent to Diameter. To calculate the duration correctly, succeed in a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number of Minutes desired.

**Hours:** The effect lasts a number of astrological hours, regardless of sunrise or sunset. Equivalent to Sun. To calculate the duration correctly, succeed in a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number of Hours desired.

**Days:** The effect lasts a number of astrological days, regardless of the lunar phase. Equivalent to Moon. To calculate the duration correctly, succeed in a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number of Days desired.

**Sign:** The effect lasts a number of astrological signs, regardless of sunrise or sunset. Equivalent to Year. To calculate

## *Mobed Beliefs on Astrology*

According to the holy Zoroastrian tome, the *Dadistan i Menok i Khrat* ("Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom"), the art of Astrology was passed from the Spirit of Wisdom to Zoroaster.

Mobeds believe that welfare and adversity on Earth originates through the seven planets and the twelve zodiacal signs. To the mobeds, the twelve great Spirits of the Zodiac are among Ohrmazd's most capable and holy defenders, constantly striving to bring goodness and wellbeing into the world. The planets (the Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn), on the other hand, are ruled by monstrous demons, which, by dint of being closer to the world, constantly thwart their zodiacal rivals and more often than not succeed in bringing ruin and misery to humanity (an explanation of why Earth is not a paradise).



#### **Invocation Wonders Level 50**

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual

Only the most pious, holy and experienced mobeds ever attempt the preparation of Saoshyant's elixir. This holy ritual requires a season of preparation to cast.

These are the instructions for preparing the elixir of eternal life, that which raises our bodies from the elements into which they have been dissolved and reunites them with our souls, as handed down from Saoshyant the Savior.

The mobed must first prepare himself for salvation by undergoing a terrible ordeal. Molten metal (usually lead) is poured over his entire body, which he must endure for three days (see Injuries, Heat and Corrosion in **ArM5**, page 181). The surging metal removes all taint from his soul and purifies his flesh, but also causes him terrible pain and injury, though it is said to feel like being bathed in warm milk if the mobed is completely without sin. Some of the metal probably sticks to his body, and if he survives he must bear these disfiguring patches grafted to his skin like tattoos for the rest of his days, as removing them again exposes him to evil and undoes the effects of the ritual.

Once the mobed are is of evil, he must sacrifice a holy animal, usually a bull with Divine Might. This provides the necessary vis for the spell, and from its fat Saoshyant's elixir may be distilled. Drink this, and for as long as the mobed strictly follows the tenets of Mazdeanism, he does not have to make aging rolls and cannot die. Instead, he gains a Warping point every year, another whenever he gains Aging or Decrepitude points from other means, and another when he would die from his wounds or a lethal blow. Fatal wounds Incapacitate him instead.

*Saoshyant's Elixir* is intensely personal and cannot be cast upon another; to gain the gift of extended life on earth, a mobed must perform it himself.

(Special)

the duration correctly, succeed in a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales + dice against an Ease Factor of 6 + Number of Signs desired.

Astrological minutes, hours, and days are equal in length to normal units of time, but have no fixed starting point, so that the effect lasts a fixed length of time, rather than until a fixed point. Astrological signs are, similarly, one-twelfth of a year each.

#### **Celestial Blessing for Holy Spell Casting**

The mobed may determine the most favorable hour for performing holy magic, holy powers or use other divine abilities. By aligning his practices to the beneficial powers of the stars, he may gain a bonus of +1 to +5. The player must decide on the activity and bonus desired before rolling, and succeed in a roll of Intelligence + Artes Liberales (Astrology) + simple die against an Ease Factor of (desired bonus x 4). If successful, the mobed determines an hour during that day (selected by the storyguide) in which the activity will benefit from the desired bonus. If the mobed does not perform the chosen activity in that hour, there is no benefit. A mobed may perform this calculation multiple times for a single day, but each hour may have no more than one bonus. A failed roll indicates that the mobed can find no more bonuses for that day.

#### **Righteousness of the Wise (Minor Mystery Virtue)**

Mobeds believe that Spenta Mainyu revealed these secrets (and others) directly to Zoroaster before taking him to Ohrmazd. For many mobeds, the attribute of wisdom is the highest nature of God.

This Mystery Virtue grants the mobed access to unique Ranges, Durations, and Targets that are compatible with Holy Powers (see insert).

#### **Saoshyant's Elixir (Major Mystery Virtue)**

The ritual of Saoshyant's Elixir (*Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 117) is the Zoroastrian route to immortality. The ceremo-

## *New Durations, Ranges, and Targets*

**New Duration: Fire**

The spell will last as long as a specific sacred fire burns in a specific fire temple (the fire and temple must be determined at the time of casting the spell). Fire is equivalent to Moon.

#### **New Range: Ground**

The target can be affected so long as he/it is touching the same ground that the caster is standing upon. The caster need not be able to see the target. Rivers, mountains and other significant obstacles (although not roads or walls) act as boundaries to this range. Furthermore, the ground must be natural earth. Artificial ground, like floorboards or cobble stones, puts a target out of this Range. Ground is equivalent to Arcane Connection.

#### **New Target: Community**

Affects everyone living in the same community. A community is defined as a group of people living in the same locality, or who form a distinct segment of society (such as Jews, beggars, or Christians, but can also include plants or animals). Community is equivalent to Boundary.


## *Long-Lived Mobeds*

There have been several long-lived mobeds: the high priests Vishtana, Tansar, and Kartir all lived for several generations, as did Osthanes, the first Prince of Magi. However, each reached a point of wanting to take their reward in the next life. The practical lifespan of a mobed with the Ameratat power is no more than around 200 years.

ny itself is a sacred and holy purification rite. Gaining this Mystery Virtue grants you knowledge of the ritual, which can be performed with the Holy Method and Power, Invocation and Wonders. Like the ritual in *Realms of Power: The Divine*, the level of this holy rite is 50.

#### **Gifts of Gayomart (Major Mystery Virtue)**

Gayomart ("Primeval Man") was the Zoroastrian Adam or "first man," and is seen as the embodiment of human perfection. This Holy Mystery opens the human body and soul to the Light of God, making those characters with True Faith even more holy and sacred.

A character must possess True Faith to initiate this mystery. The mystery grants the character additional powers as his True Faith score increases (see "Embodying the Light," *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 61).

#### **Asha (Truth): True Faith 1**

The character cannot be lied to or purposefully deceived. In his presence, no one may speak or communicate a direct lie. This power has a Penetration equal to his True Faith score, and may be increased by +5 for each Faith point spent. If this power Penetrates, even demons and faeries cannot deceive him.

#### **Vohu Manah (Good Mind): True Faith 4**

Through Vohu Mana, the mobed personifies wisdom and the true path to God. He gains a Commanding Aura (*Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 42), which grants a bonus to his soak equal to twice his True Faith score, and a commanding aura (equivalent to Aura of Rightful Authority with Voice range). (The normal Commanding Aura also grants Magic Resistance, but True Faith grants that anyway.)

#### **Hauvatat (Wholeness): True Faith 6**

The mobed's physical body becomes immune to putrefaction, change, disease and all forms of material corruption and decay. Subtract double the character's True Faith score from Aging Rolls. He more easily resists magical attempts to alter the shape of his body, inflict harm upon him or give him diseases or wounds. He gains an additional bonus to Soak and Recovery rolls equal to his True Faith Score x3 (giving a total bonus to Soak totals of True Faith x5, with the bonus from Vohu Manah). Furthermore, he no longer scars or blemishes, as his body slowly returns to its perfect natural state. Incapacitating wounds no longer leave permanent marks upon him, and given enough time (years) he can re-grow lost limbs and other body parts.

#### **Ameratat (Immortality): True Faith 8**

So long as the mobed maintain the maxims of Zoroaster and Ohrmazd, remains in a state of purity and truthfulness, observes the taboos and behaves with good thoughts, good words and good deeds, he will never die, and gain Warping Points instead of Decrepitude points. Mechanically this requires that the character have a Faith Point gained from a purity ritual at all times. His body slowly ages, although he can more easily resist its effects through the gift of Hauvatat. While this virtue means the character effectively will never die, he can still be killed by massive damage.

## *Mobed Initiations*

Mobeds can initiate unGifted practitioners into their mysteries. The rules for this are laid out in *Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, page 13.

#### **Mobed Initiation Scripts**

Mobeds use their Mobed Lore for initiation totals. The mystagogue is typically another initiated mobed or dastur. It is possible for mobeds to self-initiate if they have a script but no mystagogue, although most mobeds seek out a mystagogue from another community.

The scripts used by mobeds to Initiate their various powers typically emphasize extreme purity and lengthy prayers. Initiations can also require the initiate to challenge and overcome great foes — powerful demons and evil sorcerers. Similarly, Ordeals could also require the initiate to end famine, hunger or disease for a community. Initiation Quests typically involve the establishment of a fire temple, the conversion of a significant or notable person, or recovery and proper burial of a deceased Mazdean.

While there are many written Initiation Scripts, Mazdeanism places great value on the oral tradition; many of the living Initiations are oral Scripts.

#### **Initiation into Mythic Alchemy**

**Initiation Ease Factor**: 21

**Script Bonus**: +5 (+3 Quest: light ceremonial fire, +1 Sacrifice of wealth, +1 time)

The initiate must light one of the grand ceremonial fires of the Mazdean faith, known as the atesh adaran , in honor of the first 27 yazdan, and Ameratat. This typically takes a season to properly prepare and perform, and takes significant expenditure. The initiate must remain in a state of ritual purity throughout the process.

#### **Initiation into Mythic Herbalism**

**Initiation Ease Factor**: 21

**Script Bonus**: +13 (+3 Quest, +9




Major Flaw: Enfeebled, +1 Sympathetic Bonus)

The intitiate must must hunt down and destroy a powerful disease-causing Infernal spirit, while affected by the illness that the spirit causes. The illness must inflict the equivalent of the Enfeebled Major Flaw. This shows that he is capable of personally overcoming terrible sickness mystically and physically. Apart from the illness, the initiate must remain in a state of ritual purity throughout the initiation.

#### **Initiation into Dream Interpretation**

**Initiation Ease Factor**: 21

**Script Bonus**: +6 (+1 time, +3 Sympathetic bonus, +3 Minor Flaw: Offensive to Animals)

Dream Interpretation can only be intitiated into by a Mazdean who is married by the Mazdean ritual. The intitiate must spend a season in meditation, prayer, ritual cleansing, and contemplation of his dreams. Finally, at the end of the season, the initiate must travel deep into the wilderness in an area with many wild animals, imbibe ceremonial haoma, and survive for the night without magical aid. During this night, and thereafter, the initiate has the Offensive to Animals Flaw. Overcoming this obstacle symbolises the intitiate's triumph over nightmares.


## *Chapter Six*

# *Mythic Arabia*

Arabia is the heartland of Islam, home to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Muslims are encouraged to visit this region at some point during their lives to fulfill the obligation of the *hajj* — the greater pilgrimage to Mecca — though for many practical concerns make this impossible.

Ancient cities lie buried beneath the sands of Arabia, holy shrines are scattered across its landscape, and jinn and other supernatural creatures haunt deserted ruins and even mix with the inhabitants of some of its cities.

# *Landscape and Society*

The landscape of Arabia is more varied than most western travelers would expect. North Arabia, once known as Arabia Petra to the Romans, is a desert land of stone and sand. While much of the peninsula is indeed covered by arid deserts, there are also mountain ranges running parallel to most of the coastal regions, with narrow but fertile coastal plains between them and the sea. Of particular note is a large high plateau in the eastern half of the peninsula, encompassing the provinces of the Najd and Yamama, which has fertile valleys where crops are grown and animals (mainly sheep and goats) are pastured. In the south, the land rises into hills and mountains rich with incense trees, water, and other natural resources — significant portions of Hadramawt and Yemen are forested, and these features gave rise to the Roman name for the province, Arabia Felix. The old trade routes of the incense road that once ran through the deserts now track through the Red Sea around the Arabian coast and onwards to the fabled ports of the Erythraean Sea of the ancients.

Much of the peninsula is dotted with oases, around which villages and towns have sprung up. This is particularly true of the coastal provinces and the Najd/ Yamama region, though such settlements may also be found in some of the deserts. The exception is the dreaded Empty Quarter, an inhospitable wasteland that is rumored to swallow all who venture into it.

The inhabitants of Arabia consist of a mixture of settled townsfolk, many of whom cultivate crops for a living, and Bedouin nomads who wander with their families and flocks, trading with the townsfolk or working as guides and caravan guards on the network of trade and pilgrimage routes that cross the area. Periodically tensions flare up between townsfolk and nomads, but for the most part relations are peaceful. One influential factor here is the religion of Islam, which most people follow in one form or another, although there are also many Christians and Jews living throughout the region.

#### **Powers:**

*Donning the Corporeal Veil,* 0 points, Init +1, Terram: The zawba'a can assume material form (Size +1, as described later) to allow it to attack its opponents physically. (Greater Power; see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 102)

*Flay,* 0 points, Init +1, Corpus: As the zawba'a touches its opponent his skin is partially flayed from his body. The victim suffers a Heavy Wound. (R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind. Greater Power, 20 levels, –2 Might cost, +1 Initiative, remaining Mastery points used for Penetration Ability)

*Presence*, 0 points, Constant, Imaginem: The zawba'a is aware of everything happening in the area that it haunts, which can be up to a Structure in size. (Greater Power; see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 103)

**Vis:** When the zawba'a is destroyed, it leaves behind a small whirling column of black sand that if collected yields 3 pawns of Terram vis and 1 pawn of Auram vis.

**Appearance:** In corporeal form, the zawba'a appears as a column of sand whirling at high speed, within the heart of which chuckles a malicious, bloodthirsty face. It is about 8 ft tall.

The zawba'a is a bloodthirsty jinni of the Arabian deserts, which takes delight in slaying anyone unfortunate enough to stray across its path. It is, however, a rather single-minded creature and is unlikely to adopt any tactic beyond the frontal assault, making it relatively easy to outwit.

Some experienced sahirs are able to bargain with zawba'a and bind them as servants using the khadim bond (see Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman). Such sahirs often use these desert jinn as a form of travel — the sight of a powerful sorcerer being carried across the landscape by a whirling sandstorm instead of a mundane mount strikes respect into even the most powerful of mundane rulers!

#### **Story Seed: Death by Zawba'a?**

The characters are called in to investigate a murder. The victim was found flayed to death in his chamber, which was covered in a fine layer of sand. Investigating, the characters uncover a plot by a shadowy cabal of sahirs from a minor Islamic sect who have learned to bind the zawba'a, deadly jinn whirlwinds, to their service. The sahirs use them as weapons against their political enemies, unleashing them on unsuspecting victims. Is this what happened here, and if so, who was responsible?

The inhabited parts of Arabia are generally ruled by local dynasties, most of whom owe nominal allegiance to the Abbasid caliph of Baghdad. The Hijaz, 'Asir, and Yemen are divided between members of the Ayyubid family ((ay-YOO-bids), the family of Salah al-Din (Saladin)), with the Hijaz falling under the nominal control of the sultan of Egypt (al-Kamil Muhammad, r. 1218–38), while 'Asir and Yemen are controlled more directly by the sultan of Yemen (al-Mas'ud Yusuf, r. 1215–1229).

## *Hazards of the Deserts*

Arabia contains three major deserts: the Nefud Desert to the north, the Empty Quarter to the south, and the Dahna corridor that links the two. These deserts present a range of hazards that must be overcome if characters are to travel safely within them.

The sun burns hot in the deserts, meaning that characters need to take precautions against heat and sunstroke. This includes covering their skin to avoid sunburn and carrying adequate supplies of water to stave off dehydration. The Deprivation check time for lack of water is reduced in the deserts to 4 hours, while the sunlight does +1 non-combat damage if skin is left exposed (see **ArM5**, pages 180–181).

Another (usually natural) hazard is dry quicksands, which can swallow a man and his mount in seconds. If a character steps on one of these, he begins to sink immediately and is pulled under within two rounds. Death from suffocation follows if he is not rescued (again, see **ArM5**, pages 180–181). A character who is caught in an area of dry quicksand may make a Strength or Quickness stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9 in


## *Arabian Steeds*

The Bedouin are known for their fine horses, but also use dromedary camels in war and trade. Their jinni cousins may ride more exotic mounts such as giant ostriches, leopards, or even stranger beasts.

For a mundane Arabian racehorse, use the statistics for the Courser given in the *Book of Mundane Beasts* (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, or the Atlas Games website) and add the Imposing Appearance x2 Quality and the Great Quickness Minor Virtue, raising the beast's Presence to +1 and Quickness to +3. Similar Arabian steeds bred for war or other roles can be created using the base Destrier or Charger as templates and adding the aforementioned traits.

For a single-humped dromedary camel, use the statistics for Bactrian camels (Chapter 9: On the Silk Road) with the following modifications: decrease Strength to +1 and Stamina to +3, and increase Dex to 0. Drop the Long-Winded Virtue and the Feral Scent Flaw. Drop the Hardy Quality and decrease Fatigue Levels by one. Reputation is Cranky +1 (much of Arabia). Change combat statistics to: Init 0, Attack +4, Defense +2, Damage +2 and Soak +3. Change to Survival 3 (home terrain). Full statistics for dromedary camels are given in *Magi of Hermes*, pages 10–11.

the first round to leap or pull himself free before he sinks a significant distance, with a botch indicating that his arms are trapped in the following round. Thereafter it is up to his companions to help him escape its clutches, though if his arms are free he may assist in the second round, reducing any further Ease Factors that he may have to roll against by 3. Thereafter he has been pulled under and is not able to help.

Characters also must be wary of brigands, who prey on caravans crossing the deserts. They are likely to avoid a caravan that is clearly well-guarded, but this depends on how desperate they are for goods to support themselves.

Sandstorms may suffocate travelers or even strip the flesh from their bones. These may be natural, created by the magic of malevolent sorcerers or the manifestations of elemental jinn*.* The zawba'a, detailed in the nearby insert, is an example of a malicious jinn of whirling sand.

Various other desert jinn and demons seek to harm unwary travelers. In some cases they may use powers that affect the mind or conjure illusions, presenting travelers with visions of lush, palm-filled oases where they may quench their thirsts. A character may only realize that she has been deceived when she takes her first long draught of water, only to find her mouth full of sand.

## *The Bedouin*

Although the nomads of northern Arabia have nominally all converted to Sunni Islam, remnants of their pre-Islamic culture or code, known as *muru'a,*  have survived. The importance of hospitality (*diyafa*), courage (*hamasa*), and honor (*sharaf* for men, *ird* for women) remain paramount and color aspects of even urban Arab society. Forgiveness, loyalty, and self-sacrifice are also integral concepts. The Bedouin tribes still revere the camel above all animals, according it greater respect than even the magnificent Arabian horse or their prized falcons. Most Arabian sahirs belong to a Bedouin tribe and comparatively few dwell within cities or formal buyut, preferring to form alliances along tribal kinship and bloodlines. Due to the rich sources of vis in the area, the Bedouin wizards are heavily involved in magical trade with their urban sahir cousins, exchanging vis for rare books on the Solomonic Arts or even personal teaching.

Bedouin characters may have Personality Traits or Personality Flaws that reflect these cultural legacies. The Minor Flaw Dutybound (Bedouin code) is all but universal among Bedouin characters and reflects a general obedience to these customs. Rare characters from the deep deserts may even have the Pagan Major Flaw.

Many Faerie jinn mimic aspects of Bedouin culture, particularly the less powerful creatures referred to as jann. Most of the nomadic tribes have jinnblooded elders, are advised by wandering sahir viziers accompanied by powerful 'afrit or marid servants, and count families of true Faerie jann among their blood kinsmen. Such jinn most often take the shapes of animals beloved of the tribes: camels, falcons, saluqi hounds, or the noble Arabian horses. The ancient Jurhumite tribe, former rulers of Mecca in pre-Islamic times, contains only dark Faerie jann*-*blooded members and still refuses to submit to Islam. Several other

## *Saluqi*

Although most dogs (*kalb*) are considered unclean by non-Maliki school Muslims, the noble breed known as the saluqi are prized by their masters, often sleeping in the tents of their Bedouin owners and being lauded in poetry after their passing. Prized both for their beauty and hunting skill, these greyhound-like dogs act as coursers, operating either in speedy packs or as bird dogs in tandem with falcons. Details on hunting with hounds are given in *Lords of Men*, Chapter 5: Leisure.

Saluqi use the base statistics for

greyhounds listed in *The Book of Mundane Beasts* or *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 143, modified accordingly: add the following Qualities: Grapple, Imposing Appearance x2, Keen Eyesight and drop Keen Sense of Smell; add the Endurance Virtue and an additional Improved Characteristics Virtue; increase Presence to +1 and Stamina to +3; change to Hunt 4 (track by sight). Exceptional saluqi may have the Puissant Hunt Virtue and have powers similar to Faerie Hounds as detailed in *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 88–89.



Trees, especially the date-palm, windsculpted rocks and precious wells are treated with a respect that borders on the worshipful by the Bedouin — many of these sites are the abode of a supernatural spirit referred to as an *'ashira* ("close friend"). These creatures are appeased with gifts or respect and their homes are typically the location of auras or vis sources aligned to the various Elemental forms.

Some of the more powerful 'ashira are Magic jinn, genii loci manifestations of Arab deities worshiped in pre-Islamic Arabia, or else Infernal jinn that have usurped their place. The following represents a selection of such deities:

**Abgal:** Guardian god of Bedouin and camel drivers.

**Dhu'l-Khalasa:** God of oracles and divination.

**Dhu Shara:** God of mountains.

**Hubal**: Senior deity associated with the moon and divination.

**Ishtar:** Goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war. More commonly worshiped in ancient Mesopotamia.

**Manaf:** A fertility deity worshiped by women, though women were not allowed to touch its idols during their time of menstruation.

**Nakhla:** Goddess of the date-palm tree. **Al-Qawm:** God of war and the night. Protector of caravans.

**Sa'd:** Associated with steadfastness in battle.

**Wadd:** Protector god.

**Yaghuth:** Associated with victory in battle.

The nature of such old deities may vary and multiple entities bearing the same name can be found within miles of each other, but with widely different realm alignment and power. The benevolent version of Wadd venerated by a tribe from northern Najd may be an aloof Magic jinni, while the vengeful Infernal incarnation of the same deity feared by tribes in Uman may be a False God trying to subvert the nomads away from their faith. Others may be Faerie jinn woven out of the stories told by the Bedouin at their night fires about such fantastic natural locations. The weakest may be no more powerful than a minor elemental jinn with a Might score of less than 10, whereas the spirits of larger and more isolated landmarks may have Might scores approaching 50.

## **Story Seed: The Stone Lovers**

A group of magi or sahirs wishing to settle a pair of uniquely shaped rock outcrops in a remote Magic aura inadvertently offend the local Bedouin tribe, who consider the stones 'ashiras and thus part of their tribe. Their legends tell of two giants, Aja and Salma, banished lovers who dwelt for five hundred years at the site, slowly transforming into the vaguely human-shaped stone sentinels of today. The tribe fears that the wizards will awaken the spirits of the ossified giants or draw the attention of the dark Faerie and Infernal jinn that haunt the outcrops at night.

To settle in the area or access vis from the site, the characters must not only deal with the representatives of the local tribe, but also the evil jinn that haunt it. Frequent magical activity may awaken the sleeping giants, who may not respond favorably to the interlopers depending on whether they are elementals, demons, pre-Islamic jinn or even cursed humans.

tribes from the ancient times are believed to live on in Bedouin memory as clans of Faerie jinn*,*such as the Jadis, the tribe of Tasm and the Thamudites

Regardless of whether he is human or jinn, Muslim or pagan, a member of a Bedouin clan owes absolute loyalty to his clan first, his family second.

#### **Bedouin Wizards**

A disproportionately large number of Bedouin possess supernatural ability when compared to the town dwellers in the settled parts of Arabia. It has been noted that Bedouin sahirs are more often Gifted than their fellows in other areas of the Mythic Middle East. Such sahirs typically specialize in either Solomonic Storytelling or Solomonic Travel, although some Bedouin sahirs disdain the more specific techniques and concentrate on summoning and bargaining with jinn exclusively. These sahirs are usually accompanied by their favorite falcon or saluqi, which is actually a Faerie jinn servant bound by a khadim bond (see Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman for further details on sahirs).

All tribes include at least one sahir, often supported by female hedge magicians known as *hakima* ("wise women") or *kahina*  ("soothsayers") that resemble Folk Witches aligned to the Faerie Realm, or male *shai'ir*, poets resembling the ancient artists of pre-Islamic times. The unGifted hedge witches typically lack the Cursing and Flight powers and have the Animal Healing and Entrancement Virtues instead. Details of Folk Witches can be found in *Hedge Magic*, pages 33–53, although some of the ideas for Faerie Doctors presented in *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 117–118, may be equally appropriate. Details on Arabian poets are given in the sidebar on Arab Poetry later.

#### **Brothers of the Tribe**

Knowledge of muru'a is treated like a non-Hermetic Mystery Cult Organization Lore that can be learned like any other Ability. It is used to initiate various Faerie-aligned Supernatural Virtues of value to a desert nomad using the rules found in *The Mysteries: Revised Edition*, pages 8–20, with the tribe's hakima acting as Mystagogue. The following Virtues can be initiated and are commonly possessed by exceptional Bedouin: Animal Ken, Art of Memory, Arcadian Travel, Cursing, Death Prophecy, Dowsing, Enchanting


Poetry (as Enchanting Music), Entrancement, Greater Immunity: Thirst, Puissant Arabic, Spiritual Pact, Ways of the Desert, and Wilderness Sense.

Initiation scripts vary from tribe to tribe, but typically involve Ordeals related to the central concepts of the Bedouin code and inflict Major or Minor Personality Flaws that reflect these tenets: Generous, Higher Purpose, Overconfident, Oversensitive (to breaches of honor), Proud, Vow (always keep your word), or Weakness.


Believed by some to have originated in Mesopotamia, the art of falconry, or *al-Qanas,* is widely practiced throughout Arabia, particularly by the Bedouin tribesmen. Unlike in Mythic Europe, the primary goal of hawking is to supplement the meager nomad diet, particularly in the winter months. An exceptional bird, particularly one of the better-suited females, is still considered a mark of status by tribal leaders. The main prey hunted are the *houbara*, the *karwan* (stone curlew), and the hare. The most commonly used bird is the *saqr*, similar to the gyrfalcon, but the peregrine falcon, known as the *shahin*, is sometimes preferred.

The authority on falconry is an unnamed Arabic text by the falconer Moamyn, equivalent to a summa Level 4, Quality 7 on Animal Handling (falconry), but also containing the equivalent of a tractatus on Hunt (hawking), Quality 7. In the next decade it will be translated into Latin as the *De Scientia Venandi per Aves* by Master Theodore of Antioch at the court of King Frederick II, with a resultant Quality of only 6. By 1250, the work will have been corrected and glossed by the *Stupor Mundi* himself, resulting in the superior work known as *De arte venandi cum avibus* (Quality 8) which becomes widely copied.

See *Lords of Men*, Chapter 5: Leisure, for further details on hawking and *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 86, for training animals using magic.

#### **Saqr**

Similar to its European cousin the gyrfalcon, detailed in *The Book of Mundane Beasts*, *Realms of Power,* page 142, or *Lords of Men,* page 59, the bird most commonly used by Arabian falconers is the saqr*.*  Known for its endurance rather than its speed, the saqr has the following modifications: add the Tireless Quality and the Long-Winded Virtue. Exceptional saqr*,*  especially prized by the nomad sheikhs, possess the Puissant Hunt Virtue and the Imposing Appearance x2 Quality.

#### **Shahin**

These smaller hawks are equivalent to the peregrine falcons of Europe. These Size –4 raptors are the fastest falcons but have much less endurance. They excel in catching smaller birds on the wing, but are less suited for desert hawking. Increase the basic falcon's Quickness by 1 but subtract 2 from Strength, change to Ambush Predator, add Stealth 3 (ambush prey), decrease to Flight 3 (climbing flight) and modify their combat statistics accordingly.

#### **Anqa**

The Arabian phoenix, or anqa, is very similar to the rukh detailed in Chapter 9: On the Silk Road — its coloration consists of bright red, orange and gold. Like an Eagle of Virtue, as the anqa ages its feathers grow dim and it flies to its aerie above the Mountains of Qaf. There, immolating itself in flame, it is reborn as a single black egg. Hermetic magi observing this process over a season can treat the experience as a significatos, gaining experience in the Arts of Animal, Ignem, or Vim.

## **Story Seed: The Seven Falcons of Lukman**

Legend tells of the longevity of Lukman. One day, the son of 'Ad heard a voice calling to him and discovered a nest with two falcon fledglings. Choosing the stronger, he brought it up as his boon companion. The falcon lived for a full 80 years and the falconer aged not a day. When it died, he returned to the nest to discover another fledgling, which lived another 80 years. Once again, Lukman retained his youth. He repeated this another five times, growing sadder with the passing of each successive hawk. The seventh falcon he named Lubad, "the accumulation of all times," and when it passed, the weight of five centuries crashed down on Lukman and he finally died.

The nest lies within a Magic regio, accessible only after an arduous climb in western Arabia. Each fledgling, if raised and trained as a companion, grants its trainer immunity from all Aging rolls for a fixed duration of 80 years. Each year, the owner gains a single Warping Point. The falcon's boon is incompatible with standard Hermetic Longevity Rituals or similar magic. Once the falcon dies, the owner suffers from the Age Quickly Flaw until he raises the next hatchling. Unlike a normally fragile hawk, the bird does not need to make Aging rolls until it reaches 80 years old at which point it suddenly dies without a roll. The bird has a Magic Might of 8 and the Unaffected by The Gift Minor Virtue. It can be slain or die by other mundane means.

The tale of Lukman reaches the characters and they may wish to gain the secrets for themselves or to see if the bird's power may provide insight into a potential Longevity Ritual Breakthrough. Unfortunately, the current falcon has been trained by a Bedouin sheikh who is unaware of his magnificent hawk's value. The wizards may try to slay the immortal hawk and then follow its aggrieved owner to the secret location of the nest, but risk the ire of the tribe's sahirs and their jinn allies. Even if they defeat or compensate the sheikh, will the bird accept a foreigner ignorant of the Bedouin code of honor?


Story Flaws such as Close Family Ties, Dependent, Enemies, Feud, Pagan, and Oath of Fealty may also be appropriate for Bedouin characters.

European characters who seek to gain such Virtues may seek out the Bedouin and petition for membership of a tribe. Foreigners that demonstrate values admired by the Bedouin may be invited into the clan and eligible to undergo such ceremonies, forging a blood kinship with a nomad tribe and gaining both Dutybound (Bedouin code) and the Close Family Ties (adopted Bedouin clan) Flaw. To the Bedouin and their jinn allies, this bond of clanship ('*asabiyya*) supersedes all other loyalties. This may create difficulties for Hermetic magi when their adopted clan's interests do not align with those of their covenant or the Order of Hermes as a whole and they are forced to sacrifice either the Code or relations with their new kin. The Quaesitors may come looking for the transgressor, only to come face to face with a fully armed tribe of jinn-blooded Bedouin backing up the renegade, or that same tribe may turn up at a covenant, looking for vengeance.


## *Kohl*

Various myths tell of the origin of kohl, the black or blue powder, made from frankincense and other spices, used by women all over the Mythic Middle East as eye makeup. Many attribute its origin to the jinn, as the powder can be readily purchased from the stalls of the hidden race within the bazaars of Golden Baghdad, although the price is seldom in money. In Yamama, they tell a legend about a blueeyed witch named Zarqa al-Yamama who was blessed with vision so keen she could see a man approaching thirty miles in the distance. In ancient times when the country was still called Tasma and Jadis, she was killed by an invading Yemenite king who ordered his physicians to examine her eyes to discover the secret of her magical vision. Her eyes were found stained and smudged with kohl.

The most common magical kohl in Arabia is equivalent to a potion created by Bedouin folk witches, and confers the Minor Virtue Second Sight on a character for Sun duration when applied. Other formulations of kohl have been noted to confer differing Virtues related to enhanced sight: Keen Vision, Magic Sensitivity, Piercing Gaze, and Wilderness Sense. Ability scores granted by magical kohl have a typical score of 2 or 3, equal to the folk witch's Brew Potency/5 (round up) as detailed in *Hedge Magic*, pages 41–42.

Sahiras or Hermetic magi may use such substances for their enchantments. Kohl powder has a Shape and Material bonus of +3 to affect vision. Its main component is ground from charred resin, usually frankincense obtained from southern Arabia (see later).

# *The Najd and Yamama*

The Najd and Yamama regions take the form of a high plateau that slopes down from the west to the east. Yamama is covered with a plethora of oases, making it home to a large number of settlements where the main form of subsistence is agriculture. The Najd is more mountainous and rockier, so settlements tend to be found in the valleys where the inhabitants make use of run-off rainwater.

The majority of the population of the region is nomadic Bedouin, though the populations of some of the urban centers are quite large. Two ancient tribes of Faerie jinn — the Jadis and the Tasm — still wander through this area and are known for their unusual wares, unimpeachable honor, and offering the most marvelous hospitality.



Tayma', Khaybar, and the surrounding towns have traditionally been havens for Jews, and in 1220, they are independent settlements owing allegiance to no sultan. The Jews make up the majority of the inhabitants of the area, and are known for being fierce and clever fighters. They continue to ensure that their children learn the arts of war from an early age, and they keep their skills sharp with periodic forays, made in alliance with some of the Muslim Bedouin tribes of the area, against other settlements of the Arabian Peninsula.

# *Bahrayn*

The region of Bahrayn, consisting of both the eastern coastal territories of Arabia and islands off the east coast, has had a checkered past. Perhaps its most notorious rulers were an Isma'ili (is-ma-'EE-lee) Shi'i group known as the Qarmatians (qar-MAW-tee-anz), who reigned in the region from 899 to 1076. In 930 the Qarmatians sacked the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, stealing the Black Stone from the Ka'ba. It was returned under mysterious circumstances in 951, left wrapped in a sack in the major mosque in Kufa with a note saying, "By command we took it, and by command we have brought it back." The Fatimids (FAW-ti-midz), an Isma'ili Shi'i dynasty who ruled in North Africa at the time, are generally credited with having persuaded the Qarmatians to

## *Story Seeds for the Najd and Yamama, Bahrayn, and the Empty Quarter*

**The Jews of Tayma' and Khaybar**

Fierce and cunning fighters, the Jews of Tayma' and Khaybar are able rapidly to muster armies at times of need. Anyone who could harness their strength would hence be able to assemble a formidable fighting force at very short notice. They could therefore be useful allies if the characters suddenly find themselves facing an enemy army (such as the classic necromancer with his undead horde). However, traditional Judaism takes a dim view of magic and its practitioners, so the characters may have to go to considerable lengths to convince the Jewish elders of the region that their cause is just.

#### **The Fate of the Black Stone**

What did happen to the Black Stone during its sojourn in Bahrayn? Why was it broken? The characters find information (perhaps revealed by a Qarmatian) indicating that during its absence the stone was stolen from the Qarmatians by a renegade sahirs who wished to use it to power a ritual of unknown nature. Eventually, at considerable cost in lives, the Qarmatians were able to slay the sorcerer and recover the stone, but by the time that they did, it had been broken into seven pieces. Now the supposedly dead sorcerer has been seen abroad once more, and the descendants of the survivors of the original battle against him are gradually being murdered. The characters may be asked to protect one of the descendants, to hunt down the sorcerer, or to discover the purpose of the ritual.

#### **The Ghosts of Hajar**

A mother in Hajar misplaces her child, who becomes lost outside at night in the city. The local community of sahirs suspect the ghosts are responsible but, being unable to control the spirits of the dead, directly seek outside assistance. Can the characters find the child before the ghostly soldiers do? This story could also become the basis for a longer saga arc involving laying the ghosts to rest and freeing Hajar and the surrounding regions from their curse.

#### **The Valuable Quarter**

Due to the ease in which travelers can seemingly enter the Twilight Void and the Magic Realm, this area is sometimes known as *Rub' al-Ghali*, the Valuable Quarter, among local sahirs and the few Hermetic magi who have learned of its existence. Potentially vast resources of vis and magic from the Magic Realm are within the grasp of even the most inexperienced wizard, but unfortunately for the hopeful, returning to the mundane world does not appear to be as easy as leaving. Would-be explorers would be advised to secure some sure means of return or risk becoming lost in the eerie landscape for many lifetimes, perhaps even forever. Those who return often come back irrevocably changed and Warped — instances of mundane characters returning initiated into Sihr and one or more of the Solomonic Arts are not unheard of, but these unconventionally initiated sahirs are never fully trusted by their fellows.

Criamon magi speculate that the Empty Quarter may contain a means to pass between this world and the Counter-Cyclical Alam. Merinita contend instead that the provinces of the Empty Quarter encircle a hidden entrance to Arcadia where reflections of the ancient deities of Arabia lie trapped — whether by God, Iblis, or some Magic entity. Perhaps both or neither are correct, but the joint sponsorship of a Hermetic expedition to investigate the Empty Quarter has recently been agreed on and the two Primi are looking for young magi willing to investigate the rival claims. Some sahirs speculate that al-Hajjar and al-Zill, two of the early contributors to Solomonic Magic, may have disappeared into myth in this manner, and will one day return from their extensive wanderings like King Baluqiya of old, confirming the speculations of Islamic theology on magical kingdoms beyond the known world.


return the stone, but no-one knows for sure. Whatever the truth of this, the Black Stone was broken into seven pieces as a result of its travails, and it is now held together with a silver band. The Qarmatians' reign ended when they were ousted by the Sunni Arab Uyunid dynasty, who rule the region in 1220, but some Qarmatians still live in the area.

## *Hajar*

Hajar is the most important city in Bahrayn, being its major port and a link between Bahrayn and the coast of Persia on the opposite side of the gulf. However, its inhabitants do not go outside at night, for it bears the marks of a past trauma. In 350 the Persian emperor Shapur II (r. 309– 379) ordered his forces to attack the Arab tribes on both sides of the gulf, slaughtering, plundering, and abducting thousands of people in Hajar, the surrounding area, and the Persian coast opposite.

Now these regions are haunted by the ghosts of the dead, who come out at night and beseech anyone they meet to help them against their persecutors, at least until they are slain by weapons wielded by invisible soldiers. It is said that these weapons can slay the living too, so the local people remain indoors after dark, stopping their ears against the screams and the sounds of desperate hands pounding on their doors.

# *The Empty Quarter*

*Rub' al Khali,* the Empty Quarter, is the particularly inhospitable tract of desert that forms the border between northern and southern Arabia. No caravan tracks have crossed it since the fall of the kingdom of 'Ad in the third century and the loss of its trade in frankincense from the south — even the Bedouins skirt around its fringes. Several miles beyond the settlements in the periphery of the region, the dunes climb to great heights and the traveler enters the domain of al-Khali ("the Empty One"), a powerful elemental jinn said to stand guard over the lost lands of the al-Jahiliyya, the pre-Islamic times.

This vast trackless expanse forms one of the largest and strongest Magic auras in the Mythic Middle East. Beyond the thousand foot tall dunes that mark its periphery, the aura strength rapidly increases to 10 and the mundane terrain breaks down into an ever-shifting landscape of brightness. Multiple regiones of bright featureless sand lie within its boundary, providing subtle traps for the unwary. Such pockets of space may only be entered involuntarily, but can be accessed with astonishing ease — add 6 to the roll for entering a regio described in **ArM5**, page 189. Unfortunately, leaving the regiones is not as easy — there is a –3 penalty when trying to leave, making escape difficult for those without Second Sight, Magic Sensitivity, or other supernatural abilities.

Some travelers even find themselves directly transported into the mystical space of the Twilight Void, seemingly without passing through a detectable regio. By passing through this soft place, they find themselves adrift in the ageless space, most commonly just outside the boundary of one of the provinces of Auram, Imaginem, or Terram. Some explorers describe encountering vestiges of ancient cities or migrating nomad tribes, or have reported passing through provinces aligned to other Forms. Details on the Magic Realm and Twilight Void are given in *Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 24–26.

The ready access to the Magic realm appears to be the result of some lingering effect of an ancient magical disaster and a ritual level power of the genius loci al-Khalil, while the featureless mundane landscape appears to magically resonate with the emptiness of the Void.

# *The Hijaz*

The Hijaz is the religious heartland of Islam, being home to the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. As a result, it receives much more traffic than the rest of Arabia, particularly in the form of pilgrims. In addition, its position on the Red Sea makes it an important way station for maritime trade between the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, and its coasts are dotted with harbors that provide shelter for ships traveling to and from Egypt, the main link between the two. Sahir communities are notably few or found only far from the main cities — the density of Divine auras and regiones makes magic difficult and, even without The Gift, wizards of all types prefer to keep a very low profile to avoid provoking elements of the religious authorities. The roads to Mecca and Medina are choked with Infernal jinn, seeking to corrupt souls by encouraging impious thoughts and sowing doubt in the minds of pilgrims.

## *Non-Muslims and the Holy Cities*

Non-Muslims are not permitted to come within the *harams* ((HA-ramz); sing. *haram*) of the cities of Mecca and Medina, sacred areas extending about five miles out of each of the cities. This may, however, be problematic when designing stories involving the two holy cities, unless the entire party consists of Muslim characters. You may wish to adopt one of the following approaches:

- • The characters may seek to visit the holy cities without being discovered. Magic will certainly help in this regard, though once the characters are within the cities they are likely to have difficulty casting spells due to the high Dominion auras there. Mundane disguises may actually be a better option, though the characters will need to be at least slightly skilled to avoid discovery. Needless to say, doing this is a grave act of sacrilege, and characters caught trying to sneak into the cities in this way will face severe penalties.
- • You may wish to have a smaller group, consisting of only Muslim characters, visit the city, with the other members of the troupe taking on the roles of



other Muslims whom the characters meet along the way.

- • Alternatively, maybe a special arrangement can be made if the characters are able to prove their need to visit the cities. Maybe they may visit as long as they are accompanied by representatives of the local authorities, or maybe the holy sites are still off-limits to the non-Muslim characters, but they may visit the other parts of the cities freely.
- • A more radical, but probably the easiest, solution is to assume that non-Muslims are allowed to visit the Mythic versions of the holy cities, with no further complications or restrictions involved.

Whatever approach you take, a visit to the holy cities, for a Muslim or a non-Muslim, should be an intensely religious experience. These are, after all, cities where God intervened directly and frequently in human affairs, and such concentrated divine attention has left a legacy of holiness that affects all who visit. As one result of this, the harams bear Dominion auras of 3, and the Dominion auras in the cities themselves are usually 4 and often even higher. Fighting and the taking of life (except slaughtering animals for food or destruction of savage or diseased animals) is forbidden in the haram areas of the two holy cities. Unless otherwise noted, all Muslim Dominion auras within these areas bear a Calm Temper Trait at a score of +3 (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 38-39). Transgressors may be struck down with a visible manifestation of God's ire, even for minor infringements — reports of impious travelers provoking instances of the Curses *Ignis Domini, Smiting of the Lord ,* or *Swallowed Alive and Sent to Hell* are wellknown, albeit rare (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 89).

## *Medina*

Medina, *Madinat al-Nabi* ((ma-DEEnat un-NA-bee), "the City of the Prophet"), is the second holy city of Islam and is situated on a flat plain cradled between several mountains and ancient lava flows, the junction of a number of valleys and passes through the mountains. The soil is unusually fertile, and a variety of fruits and cereals are grown here. The city is surrounded by strong walls with watchtowers built by the sultan of Syria, Nur al-Din (r. 1146–1174), in 1162. The governor currently owes allegiance to the sultan of Egypt, although the city is largely left to run its own affairs. The city has traditionally been home to a large number of religious scholars; the famous jurist Malik ibn Anas (d. 795), who founded the major Sunni school of law that became known as the school of the Malikis ((MEH-li-keez), "the followers of Malik"), is one of those who lived and worked here.

Dominion auras in Medina are one point higher than they would be elsewhere, and the city is the site of numerous mosques, shrines, and other historical sites.



The holy city of Mecca lies in a valley between several mountains, sheltered from the winds and heat of the wilderness. The city contains both urban dwellings and a multitude of shrines, convents, religious colleges, and especially mosques, of which there are 100. At its center lies the greatest of these, the Haram Mosque, within which is the Ka'ba. As indicated earlier, the Arabic term *haram* indicates the inviolable sacred areas surrounding and including Mecca and Medina (see Non-Muslims and the Holy Cities, earlier), but it is also used to indicate the Haram Mosque specifically. The divine influence on Mecca is clear: the climate is supernaturally mild, vegetation grows lush but never wild, and a sense of peace pervades the streets. As in Medina, all Dominion auras in the city are one point higher than they would be normally.

Mecca is always densely populated. In addition to the townsfolk who serve the city's needs, many religious scholars live and work in the Haram Mosque and the other religious buildings here. In addition, the city sees constant traffic as pilgrims arrive, stay for periods ranging from a couple of weeks to a few years, then move on again. The majority of the people who live in Mecca are Sunnis, but there are also a large number of Zaydi (ZAY-dee) Shi'is here. Pilgrims come from almost all Muslim denominations.

The city is ruled by a governor known as the Grand Sharif (sha-REEF), a descendent of the Prophet through his grandson al-Hasan and a member of the Hawashim clan; the current Grand Sharif is Qatada

## *Story Seeds for the Holy Cities*

#### **The Lava Flows of Medina**

The lava flows around Medina cooled and hardened centuries ago, but occasional earthquakes open cracks in them, allowing fresh lava to flow out. The characters learn that the earthquakes are not a natural phenomenon, but are instead the results of experiments by forces hostile to Medina who is attempting to reliquify the lava flows all around the city. Will they be able to stop them before they achieve this and drown the holy city in molten lava?

#### **The Lost Lords of Mecca**

The Jurhumites are an ancient tribe of jann*-*blooded Bedouin who once ruled Mecca and areas of the Hijaz. They rejected Islam and appeared to be defeated by the early armies but now live on within old tales about the pre-Islamic tribes of Arabia. The whole tribe now consists of Faerie jann*,* although a few jinn*-*blooded sahirs are secretly considered adopted members of their clan. They are best represented as dark Faerie Jinn and play roles in stories about crises of faith or dishonor and tend to have more elemental magic (specifically Auram and Terram powers) at their disposal than their usual Faerie cousins (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). As former inhabitants of Mecca, Jurhumites are potential guides for non-Muslims attempting to infiltrate the holy cities for subterfuge or war, being privy to secret ways into the closed areas.

The Jurhumite sahir might seek out Hermetic magi to aid them in their feud against the current regime. Are the Jurhumites behind the change in the lava flows around Medina, or are they merely being used as scapegoats by a opportunistic group of renegade sahir?

#### **The Restoring Waters of Zamzam**

On the night after the end of Ramadan, the Divine aura in the Well of Zamzam at Meca's Haram mosque dips slightly and the water in the well can be harvested by moonlight as an unusual form of Extraordinary Aquam Vis. Each mouthful of water is able to restore all of a character's lost Fatigue Levels through an unknown ritual level non-Hermetic effect. Hermetic magi may be tempted to obtain such a remarkable substance, whether for personal use or as a potential source of Insight into overcoming the Hermetic Limit of Energy.

#### **The Marid of the Well**

Unknown to most of the pilgrims, the eponymous Zamzam — an ancient Magic marid *—* lies trapped in a suppressed Magic regio at the base of the Well of Zamzam at Mecca's Haram mosque, its powers overcome by the overwhelming Divine aura. The spirit's remaining magical power preserves the well's amazingly pure water but it has come to resent its imprisonment by the Dominion.

Ancient beyond belief, the Zamzam marid may also have knowledge of the past useful to the characters that cannot be gained from any other source, but how can one discreetly communicate with such an entity within the most holy shrine of Islam? If freed, what would its actions be and how would the Muslim authorities react to such desecration of the ancient spring?

#### **The Mosque of the Jinn**

A magus of House Merinita hires the characters to conduct an investigation into the Mosque of the Jinn at Mecca, demanding that they provide an extensive report on its denizens and visitors in the hope of understanding how and why such Faerie creatures seemingly ape the worship of the Dominion without producing a Divine aura.

The normally hospitable Jinn become considerably less enthusiastic when it becomes apparent that the characters are there to observe, rather than take part in Muslim worship, since it is from human participation in the latter that the jinn derive vitality. Many of the jinn object to being treated like lab specimens. How can the characters resolve this situation without upsetting either their hosts or their employer?


(r. 1201–1220). If your saga follows history, in 1220, Qatada, along with many other members of his family, is killed when his son al-Hasan carries out a massacre to ensure his succession. However, the Ayyubid sultan of Yemen, al-Mas'ud Yusuf, steps in to quell the chaos and imposes military rule. The Grand Sharifs only regain control after the sultan's death in 1229.

#### **The Haram Mosque and the Ka'ba**

The Haram Mosque is the most sacred of mosques, the building that holds the Ka'ba, the shrine built by Adam under the guidance of angels, and subsequently rebuilt by Abraham and his son Ishmael. It takes the form of a rectangular courtyard, around which are highly-decorated open halls supported by multiple rows of columns. Off the northwest hall is the Dar al-Nadwa (DAHR un-NAD-wa), a building constructed around a second hall, where consultation is carried out between religious scholars and the Grand Sharif. Off the southwest hall is a building used by scholars of the Maliki legal school. The mosque has twenty gates and seven minarets. The Dominion aura here is overwhelming, with a score of 10. Muslim characters may invoke baraka here to request any of the Saint Powers listed in *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 88–89; if required, the site counts as having Divine Might of 100.

The Ka'ba itself takes the form of a cuboid shrine, about 40 feet on each side and 46 feet tall. Although it is richly decorated, the upper parts of the walls are generally kept mostly covered with a green drapery known as the kiswa (KISwa). Implanted into the wall at the eastern corner, about five feet from the ground, is the Black Stone, said to have been cast from Heaven to show Adam and Eve where to build the Ka'ba. According to tradition, the stone was originally white but turned black as it absorbed sins over the centuries. Muslim pilgrims attempt to touch or kiss the stone to gain forgiveness for their sins.

The Ka'ba may be entered through a door on the northeast wall, which is about seven feet above ground level and reached by a wheeled set of wooden steps that is pushed up to the door when it is opened. The inside is richly decorated with slabs of marble of many colors, and normally one finds within three columns that support the roof, a staircase leading to the roof, and a variety of Muslim artifacts and relics, including several ancient and valuable copies of the *Qur'an* and documents on the walls that record the activities of those who renovated the Ka'ba. The exception is on days when the Ka'ba is opened to the public, which is most Mondays and Fridays, for on those days pious Muslims who enter the Ka'ba find themselves in a terrestrial divine regio, still at aura level 10, which represents an even more richly decorated version of the Ka'ba and has the distinctive feature of being able to accommodate more people than could normally fit inside the building.

Muslims in the Ka'ba usually seek to pray at the place where the Prophet used to pray, about five feet from the southwest wall, and at such times, miraculously, they may all pray in the same place without crowding each other. Whether the regio is accessible or not, Muslims may seek to invoke baraka from Muhammad both inside and just outside the Ka'ba.

Within the courtyard of the Haram mosque also lies the marble domed Well of Zamzam, about 20 yards east of the Ka'ba. Revealed to Ibrahim's wife Hajar when she was searching for water for her thirsty son Ishmael, the well is older than the first buildings of Mecca. The waters are clean and pure but although they are drunk by many Muslim pilgrims as part of their devotion, they do not usually have any supernatural properties.

#### **Al-Ma'la Cemetery and the Mosque of the Jinn**

Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave ear, and they said: Lo! We have heard a marvelous Qur'an,

Which guideth unto righteousness, so we believe in it and we ascribe no partner unto our Lord.

And (we believe) that He exalted be the glory of our Lord hath taken neither wife nor son,

And that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning Allah an atrocious lie.

— *The Qur'an* 72: 1-4

On the northern edge of Mecca is the cemetery of al-Ma'la, where many of the Prophet's family members and followers are buried, including Amina, his mother; Khadija, his first wife; and 'Abd al-Muttalib, his grandfather. Near the cemetery is a mosque known as the Mosque of the Jinn, where a group of jinn heard the Prophet reciting the *Qur'an* and were thereby persuaded to convert to Islam.

The mosque has since become the apparent center of jinn worship of God, and they continue to gather publicly at this place, so that at prayer times, and especially at the Friday noon prayer, it bustles with Faerie jinn of all manner of shapes and sizes. Even the mosque officials are undisguised jinn.

Unspoken convention requires that all jinn attending prayers avoid assuming forms that are too monstrous or so large as

## *The Hajj*

The hajj is one of the five "Pillars of Islam," five practices that mark someone as being a Muslim. All Muslims are obliged to perform the hajj at least once during their lifetime, if at all possible. For most who undertake it, it is a life-changing event, often leading them to abandon inappropriate practices and make a new start in life.

Details of the hajj *are* presented in *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 108.

A Muslim who has completed the hajj gains a Personality Trait of Pious +3. The Muslim also gains 3 Faith Points. It is possible to undertake the hajj again to regain the Personality Trait and Faith Points, but repeated performance of the hajj will never raise the Personality Trait above +3.



to take up too much space in the mosque. A few humans also attend prayers at the mosque, interacting freely with its supernatural inhabitants. Respectful mortals, including sahirs and other wizards, are always welcomed, if sometimes a bit overenthusiastically. The mosque has a Faerie Aura of 4 which rises to 5 when the jinn are attending prayers.

## *Ta'if*

About 60 miles to the southeast of Mecca, built on the mountain slopes, lies the town of Ta'if. Before the rise of Islam, Ta'if was the site of a major idol to the Arabian goddess al-Lat, goddess of fertility and patron of shepherds and caravan travelers, but after the Muslim conquest of the city in 631 this idol was destroyed. Ta'if is well-known for its orchards, and it supplies fruit to many other towns of the region, including Mecca.

#### **The Cult of the Daughters of Allah**

**Al-Lat** was one of three major goddesses worshiped in the local area, the other two being **al-Manat**, goddess of fortune and destiny, whose cult was based at a place called al-Qudayd, at an unknown location about ten miles from Medina, and **al-'Uzza**, goddess of strength and the planet Venus, who was worshiped at a sanctuary on the outskirts of Mecca. These three goddesses were known as the "Daughters of Allah." Even before the rise of Islam, Allah was worshiped by the pagans as a supreme creator god, and these Daughters are connected with a story known as that of the "Satanic Verses," which by 1220 has been circulating for centuries among Muslim scholars.

According to this story, at one point during the Prophet's lifetime, the Qur'anic revelation allegedly was somehow adulterated by Iblis, who managed to achieve the temporary insertion into the text of verses that permitted the Muslims to ask the Daughters of Allah to intercede with Him on their behalf. According to the story, this was immediately corrected by God, who revealed to His Prophet verses that rejected such a role for the goddesses. Whether this incident actually happened remains a matter of debate among Muslim scholars of the 13th century.

In Mythic Arabia, Ta'if is home to the Cult of the Daughters of Allah, a family-based cult that has secretly kept the worship of the Daughters of Allah alive throughout the centuries. At any given point in time, there are three members of the family, each of whom can channel the power of one of the three deities. The family's ultimate objective is to restore the worship of the Daughters of Allah, but first they need to find the sanctuaries of all three goddesses; they have found the sanctuaries of al-Lat and al-'Uzza, and now they are in the process of seeking out al-Qudayd and the lost sanctuary of al-Manat. The current family consists of a



Poetry has an important place in Bedouin culture, the earliest examples dating from before the rise of Islam. Thepoet (*shai'ir* ; not to be confused with sahir) and the reciter (*rawi)* hold a position combining elements of historian, soothsayer, and panegyrist. Verses in praise of the tribe or sheikh, known as *qit'ah*, and scathing attacks on the virtue of other tribes, referred to as *hija'*, form the bulk of the works transmitted through oral tradition. *Zajal*, mock battles in verse, remain popular as a way of resolving hostilities between Bedouin sahirs. This is mechanically an opposed roll of Communication + Solomonic Storytelling for sahirs, or Communication and Folk Ken for battles between mundanes, but characters with an Arabic score of 6 or greater gain a +2 to their total.

Poetry and storytelling remain an integral part of Arab life in the 13th century and it is thought that exceptional performances may produce wondrous effects. The Art of Memory, valued by Islamic scholars for reciting the *Qur'an*, is believed to have originated among the pagan poets. Enchanting Poetry and Entrancement are common among Bedouin poets, even among non-wizards, and the former is the most commonly initiated Major Supernatural Virtue gained through devotion to muru'a.

A fabled example is the irascible satirist, Abu Nuwas, a poet sponsored at the legendary court of Harun al-Raschid, who passed into the myth and legend of Golden Baghdad as a Faerie creature of Elysium, living within the tales of *The Thousand and One Nights*.

# **Story Seed: Poets and Qareen**

*'Abqari*, contemporary poets blessed with an artistic qareen*,* can be created using the rules for Legendary Artists or Maestro Mythic Companions (see *Art & Academe*, pages 133–135). The qareen of such characters are best reflected by the Faerie Friend, Magical (Being) Companion, or Impious Friend Minor Flaws, depending on the Realm affiliation of the artist. Many 'abqari possess Enchanting Poetry and the Muse Minor Supernatural Virtues (*Houses of Hermes: Societates,* page 56). Some of these poets are granted such power over words that they may mimic the Folk Witch power of Cursing or the Gruagach Arts of Give, Blessing, and Curse, reflecting their ability to lampoon and satirize opponents into misfortune through their verse (see *Hedge Magic Revised Edition* for details of these non-Hermetic powers).

Journeying to 'Aqbar may compose part of an Initiation Script for a member of the Merinita "Keepers of Tales" Mystery Cult, or be of interest to Jerbiton magi or artistic Redcaps passionate about the stories and legends of *The Thousand and One Nights*.

## **Story Seed: The Poetry Festival at 'Ukaz**

Once a year the small oasis town of 'Ukaz, situated halfway between Mecca and Medina, holds a poetry competition, a tradition dating back to ancient times. The seven great poems known as the *Mu'allaqat* ("the Suspended Odes") that now grace the walls of the Ka'ba had their origin in this fair. Today, the winner's prize varies from year to year as the sponsorship of the fair passes from one tribe of jinn to another. The prize is always something of great value — one year, the jinn may reward a winner with the secret path to 'Abqar, another year they may bestow kinship with their tribe for eternity, and yet another they may offer the service of one of their younger jinn as an unconditional servant. Depending on the prize, magi and sahirs may be drawn to the festival, hoping to gain something otherwise impossible to acquire — something vital to their plans. Competition is always fierce, but the poetry is always breathtakingly beautiful.

man named 'Abd al-Qadir, his son Yusuf, and Yusuf's wife Farida.

Depending on how you wish to depict the cult in your saga, you may choose to generate the members of the cult using the rules for Spirit Votaries (*Realms of Power: Magic*, pages 88–89); alternatively, it may be that the cult is infernally corrupted, in which case the rules for Diabolists may be more suitable (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 101–113).

'Abd al-Qadir, as the representative of al-Lat, has powers over fertility and travel, including the ability to control the growth of humans, animals and plants, and travel supernaturally swiftly from one place to the next. Yusuf, as the representative of al-Manat, can affect probabilities, affecting players' die rolls, and Farida, as the representative of al-'Uzza, is supernaturally strong and also has powers over Venus' traditional realms of beauty, romance, the performing arts and communication.

# *'Asir & Yemen*

To the south of the Hijaz lie the provinces of 'Asir and Yemen, controlled by the Ayyubid sultan of Yemen. The majority of the population are either Sunnis or Zaydi Shi'is, although in Yemen there are also scattered communities of Tayyibis (TOYyi-beez), an offshoot of the Isma'ili Shi'i Fatimids who maintain the belief in a hidden dynasty of imams. The Tayyibis are heavily involved in trade and have regular contact with the island of Soqotra to the south, home to a strange culture of non-Hermetic sorcerers (See *Rival Magic,* pages 110–141, for more details on Soqotran Sorcerers). As a result of their seafaring, the Yemenites are even beginning to expand into the old Ethiopian lands in Africa and across the Arabian Sea into al-Sind.

## *Sana'a*

Located in the highlands of Yemen, where the air is fresh and the temperature cool, the city of Sana'a is the administrative center of the Yemen-'Asir region, home to


the Ayyubid sultan al-Mas'ud Yusuf. It is renowned for its market, the Suq al-Milh (Salt Market), where all sorts of oddities may be found by the persistent, and for the quality of its food.

## *The Valley of 'Abqar*

In Al-Jahiliyya, the pre-Islamic times, jinn were said to dwell in the Valley of 'Abqar and inspire the greatest of the old Arabian bards and poets, acting as their Supernatural Muses. The valley may be a faerie regio accessed from both Yemen or southern Jordan, a city or town within Arcadia, or perhaps all of these simultaneously.

## *Ma'rib*

To the east of Sana'a lie the remains of Ma'rib, the ancient capital of Balqis (or Bilqis), the Queen of Sheba. It was once ruled by *mukkaribs*, hereditary priest-kings

## *Story Seed: Farida's Fears*

The cult of the Daughters of Allah discovers the location of the sanctuary of al-Manat and begins a tripartite ritual that is intended to bring about apocalyptic results, possibly restoring the goddesses to the mortal realm, or damaging or destroying the Ka'ba at Mecca. The player characters get wind of this and must take action to stop them.

Farida, as the newest member of the family, has qualms about her involvement in the cult. Perhaps she feels strongly connected to her Muslim upbringing, which is leading her to have second thoughts. Maybe she is being asked to engage in practices that she finds conflict with her own morals. More sinisterly, perhaps she is pregnant, and she has been told by her father-inlaw that she will be giving birth to her replacement, making her concerned for her future in a family that is normally limited to only three members. Will the characters be able to help her?

## *Story Seed: The Food of Sana'a*

Why is the food in Sana'a so universally good? The characters gain possession of a cooking vessel from Sana'a and discover that it bears a hedge magic enchantment that makes meals unusually tasty, but that also Warps those who use the vessel over an extended period of time. If such cooking vessels are in widespread use, then the entire population of the town may be suffering from Warping effects unawares. Who created these vessels, and do they know of the damage that they are causing the people of Sana'a?

## *Suleiman and the Queen of Sheba*

Suleiman heard from the hoopoe (a brightly-colored bird fond of traveling widely) of the Queen of Sheba's kingdom, a land where the people worshiped the sun alongside God, and so he decided to invite Balqis to discuss her faith with him. She accepted his invitation and prepared riddles and difficult questions with which to test him. Then she set out to Jerusalem in a caravan laden with gold, spices, and precious jewels.

Suleiman, in the meantime, asked his court if anyone could bring the queen's throne before she arrived. A jinni boasted that it could obtain it before Suleiman rose from his seat, but "one who had knowledge of the Book" promised to bring it in the blink of an eye. The throne thus procured, it was disguised to test whether Balqis was a recipient of divine guidance. When she entered Suleiman's throne room she remarked on how much the throne resembled her own, but then when she entered a hall paved with glass she mistook it for a lake, drawing up her skirts and baring her legs. When her folly was revealed, she recognized that her worship of the sun was also incorrect and acknowledged God as the only deity.

#### **Story Seed: King Suleiman and the Queen of Sheba**

Remains of Sheba's sun worship might still be present in Ma'rib or other sites across the Middle East — the actual deities that the people of Sheba worshiped might be in reality either powerful Faerie entities, who crave worship from humans and plot to achieve this, or demons who represent themselves as a heavenly trinity, seeking to turn people away from worship of the True God. Was the magic of the mukkaribs a variant of the more common summoning arts — instead of calling jinn, could it command and control celestial entities and Astra Planeta Daimons in a way similar to the Theurgical Mysteries?

Characters might encounter the hoopoe or its descendents, magical creatures who might be guides through the region or even prove suitable as familiars or magical covenfolk. Also, what became of the queen's throne and the hall paved with glass? Perhaps they are supernatural or even Divine items that remain somewhere, waiting to be rediscovered.

In addition, what became of Suleiman and the Queen of Sheba? According to tradition, they both died, but they were powerful sorcerers. Could they still be alive, perhaps working behind the scenes to influence human events? Perhaps the Queen's skills at entrancement and political magic has secretly left a legacy within the Storytelling magic of current sahirs, a legacy that may hint at further mysteries yet to be incorporated into the Solomonic Arts?

**Vis:** 2 pawns Corpus, in foot.

**Appearance:** The nisnas looks like a small man, but with half a head (with no face), half a body, one arm, one leg, a sheep's tail and half a face implanted in its chest.

The nisnas is found in the forests of Yemen and Hadramawt, though its origin seems to be in Hadramawt specifically. It is a wild, inoffensive creature, but the people of Hadramawt find its flesh sweet, so they hunt it for food. Nisnases can speak, and tales are told of some who begged for mercy before they were slain.

## **Story Seed: An Escaped Nisnas**

The characters come across a nisnas that has escaped from its captors. It begs them to help it get away. This is likely to raise a moral or emotional dilemma for some characters. According to most religious teachings, only humans have souls. Yet this creature seems literally half-human; so does it have a soul? Even if not, will the characters willingly refuse aid to a creature that is begging for them to help it escape from being eaten?

of celestial deities representing the sun, moon, and stars: al-Shams, 'Ilmaqa, and al-Zuhara.

Most of the palaces, temples, and gardens lie in ruins now, but the great jinn-built temple of Ghumdam remains, standing in solitary silence and bearing a Magic aura of 6, although smaller less powerful auras are scattered throughout the city, home to pagan jinn that once served the Queen at the bequest of King Suleiman. The great dyke that once held back the waters of the Wadi Udhana, protecting the city from the depredations of the uncontrollable water elementals that plague the river upstream, lies broken in the high mountains.

The lands around here could be a good spot upon which to found a covenant, if the characters could overcome the difficulties of supplying such a remote site and the hostile supernatural inhabitants, who bear no love for wizards or summoners.

# *Hadramawt*

Hadramawt is a relative backwater in the Muslim world. Its valleys contain few sources of water and are only sparsely populated, while the hills, though at some points heavily forested, are too steep to make agriculture or coppicing viable means of subsistence. Very few pilgrims or other travelers make it this far south, and the people tend to be surprised when they encounter strangers. It is remarkable only for the unusual creature known as the nisnas (nis-NEHS) and being the source of many of the resins and spices traded throughout the Mythic Middle East passing along the coast to Mythic Europe.

Like other distant areas of the Mythic Middle East, its isolation may make it appealing as a potential site for initial Hermetic settlement, because the magical resources of the wilderness and the various Magic jinn aligned to its natural features are relatively unknown to all but a handful of itinerant sahirs. The extreme lack of mundane resources, sparse population, and its distance from larger settlements will require magical solutions for the covenant to prosper.

## *Frankincense and Myrrh*

Both these resinous materials are obtained from gnarled trees that grow predominantly in the fog-wrapped mountains of Hadramawt, although groves can be found in parts of Oman, Ethiopia, and on the isolated island of Soqotra. Harvesters tap the trees, making small incisions that allow the milky sap to exude slowly and then harden into "tears" of sticky resin over three months. The two resins form the main ingredients of incense used throughout the Mythic Middle East and


Mythic Europe. Myrrh was traditionally more expensive in ancient Rome, although frankincense has always been more popular, and each is worth more than its weight in gold when traded.

The resin trees are found on the more inaccessible wooded slopes of the area and guarded by flying serpents known as syrenii (or iaculii). These mundane guardians must be driven off by harvesters with smoke created by burning a similar resinous reagent imported from Anatolia known as storax.

Frankincense, literally "incense of the French," comes from the stunted and hardy mogar tree. It is commonly referred to as olibanum (*al-lubban,* "that which results from milking"). It is a light yellow resin, often tinted with green, known for its medicinal qualities, in particular its ability to quicken the blood. The quality of the resin depends on the exact climatic and soil conditions, with each tree having a specific time when it produces its best resin. When burned, it gives off a slightly balsamic and lemony fragrance characteristic of incense. The charred resin is one of the main components of the eye-powder referred to as kohl (see earlier). Frankincense resin has the following Shape & Material bonuses: +3 medicine, +5 promote life.

Myrrh, in contrast, is a reddish-brown resin, with the best quality specimens being both darker and more translucent than


inferior examples. It has a sharp pleasant scent and when burned gives off a heavy, acrid smoke with a hint of vanilla. Apart from its use in incense, it is used as an additive in wine, for embalming ointment, and in the holy oil used by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Myrrh has the following Shape & Material bonuses: +3 relieve arthritis or inflammation, +5 preservation, +2 sanctify.

## *Flying Serpent (Iaculus)*

The flying serpents known to Pliny as syrenii are found in great numbers in southern Arabia and on the island of Soqotra to the far south of Yemen (see *Rival Magic*, page 110). The Arabian snakes are typically white in coloration with batlike wings, and an individual syrenus may sport a pair of short legs. These snakes perch in the incense trees of Hadramawt and are known for their darting attack, leaping out of trees onto passing prey. Flocks of syrenii attempt to migrate into Egypt each year, only to be destroyed by their natural enemies, the ibises.

Hermetic magi refer to these snakes as iaculii, but most mundanes call them "javelin-snakes" or "darters" due to their unusually rapid and lethal method of attack. As the ibis is linked to Thoth and therefore Hermes, most Hermetic magi consider an iaculus an ill-omened creature, but at least one Quaesitor uses them as aids to his investigations. Exceptional syrenii are believed to have additional powers allowing them to ignore wards and other protection magic in order to deliver their venom, but these claims have yet to be investigated by Hermetic magi. Their exact relationship to the magical Olibanum Serpents of Soqotra is unclear but the Arabian serpents are much less sociable than their kin and appear resistant to being tamed short of magical means. It is not known whether the syrenii originated on Soqotra or the more aggressive variety represents a more primitive species that was then imported from the mainland.

Syrenii use the base statistics for Adders listed in *The Book of Mundane Beasts* or *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 141, modified as follows: increase Quickness to +4; gain ability to fly; add Ferocity (when leaping) and Improved Characteristics Virtues; add the Fast Flyer and Good Jumper Qualities; add Athletics 4 (jumping). Any character who makes a Intelligence + Magic Lore or Intelligence + Arabia Lore roll against an Ease Factor of 9 will recall that these creatures can be scattered by burning the resin of the storax tree.



#### **The Trees That Cry Blood**

In the seaside hills of Hadramawt is a grove of five ancient mogar trees that seem to grow directly from the rock, resisting even the thrashings of the seasonal monsoons of the Erythraean Sea. The resin produced from these trees, when harvested during a violent storm, yields unusually pure frankincense tears that each contain a single pawn of dedicated Rego Terram vis each tree produces several pawns of vis per harvest. The timing of the harvest storms is complex, but well-known to the local inhabitants, who are terrified of the particularly large and aggressive population of syrenii nestled among the branches of the grove. Harvesting the vis is no easy undertaking, as the serpents seem immune to the usual storax smoke and standard wards appear to have little effect.

Even if successfully harvested, the existence of the trees becomes readily known to another magical group, whether they be rival Hermetic explorers, local hedge wizards or sahirs representing the Order of Suleiman. Perhaps renegade members of the Olibanum tribe of the normally isolationist Soqotrans are interested in the unusual resin produced (see *Rival Magic* for details on these non-Hermetic wizards). Continued supernatural disturbance and intense magical activity or botches in the grove may awaken the trees, providing another obstacle to harvesting as the animated bushes gain the ability to actively resist interlopers with their spiny arms. Are the tears of the trees worth the price in blood?

#### **Discovering the Lost City**

There are a number of ways that characters might come across this lost city. They might come across a map indicating its location; they might be approached by a descendent of one of the survivors of the destruction who wishes to recover something from the city; or they might come across it purely by accident, finding a tunnel into the earth or even reaching it after falling victim to a patch of dry quicksand.

However they find it, visitors to the city find it intact in a great cavern under the desert, still filled with the riches of its inhabitants, along with their desiccated corpses, and the Magic auras here remain strong. Indeed, this makes it an attractive site for a new covenant. The major difficulty is navigating the city, for its inhabitants were about 12 yards in height and hence everything is built on a much larger scale than it would be for normal humans.

The discovery of the ancient city may draw the attention of the remaining Giants of 'Ad, itinerant stonesmiths renown for their building skills. Will the giants look favorably upon the discoverers or will they try and prevent the city from disclosing its ancient secrets and treasures?

#### **The Witches of Nizwa**

Perhaps the witches of Nizwa are a movement of Infernalists or Faerie wizards who become the arch-enemies of the characters. Banished Soqotran witches may have formed a secret community in exile, or the group may be agents of the Olibanum King trying to discredit and destabilize the Order of Suleiman (see *Rival Magic,* pages 110–141). The group may even be the last remnant of a tradition of sorceresses privy to the astral magic of ancient Sheba.

Alternatively, the rumors may be utterly unfounded, which has interesting implications if the characters have found an attractive site for a covenant near the city, leading to stories, or even a complete saga, based on the theme of overcoming negative preconceptions and stereotypes.

## *Iram, City of a Thousand Pillars*

(The tribe of) 'Ad rejected warnings. Then how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings.

Lo! We let loose on them a raging wind on a day of constant calamity,

Sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm-trees.

Then see how (dreadful) was My punishment after My warnings!

— *The Qur'an* 54: 18-21

The capital city of Ubar was home to the people of 'Ad, a race of giants who held sway over much of Yemen, Hadramawt, and 'Uman five generations after the Great Flood, from their mythical homeland of al-Akhaf. However, the people of 'Ad were idolaters, and when God commissioned one of them, the prophet Hud, to bring them back to the right religion, they rejected him, persisting in their idolatry even after God inflicted a drought on them as a warning. In the end God sent a great storm to destroy them, with the exception of Hud and the few who accepted his message. The storm drove the city deep into the sands. There it lies still, waiting to be discovered by explorers.

The great depression in the sands above the surface of the city has a Magic aura of 5, hinting at the greater riches beneath.

# *'Uman*

Located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula, 'Uman's interior is mostly hot and dry desert, while the coastal mountains and plains are cooler and more fertile, supporting agriculture. The province also forms a channel for trade between Arabia and the Indian Ocean, which is conducted via various ports on its coasts. The majority of the population of 'Uman follow a variant form of Islam called Ibadism.



Perhaps the same as the *Crypto Portus*  ("Hidden Port") of Ptolemy or the Moscha of Pliny, this coastal town is a prominent trade point for voyages traveling beyond the Mythic Middle East. Many voyagers dreaming of wealth depart, never to return, from its quays. Recently conquered from the Abbasids by the local Yahmad tribe, the city is looking to expand trade further eastwards. It is the home of a large group of sahirs specializing in the Solomonic Art of Travel, who have founded a bayt al-hikma dedicated to discovering the legendary islands encountered in the tales by Sinbad the Sailor.

## *Nizwa*

Nizwa is the royal city of 'Uman, home to the local Nabhanid kings and a center of religion, trade and art. It has numerous beautifully decorated mosques and palaces, as well as bustling markets that are particularly famous for their silver jewelry and finely crafted daggers. Several buyut of sahirs are found within the city and its hinterlands.

However, Nizwa also has a darker side, reputed to be the home of witches and sorcerers. Among the deeds ascribed to these are instantaneous travel, achieved by crossing a line drawn in the sand to appear at another location, and, more sinisterly, turning people into mindless slaves by making them appear to die, then taking their "corpses" and controlling them.

## *Giant of 'Ad*

Descendants of Great 'Ad, the giants of southern Arabia are colossal magical creatures from pre-Islamic times. Descended from Noah's third son, they have dwelled within magic regiones deep within the deserts of Oman since the loss of their greatest creation, the fabled City of a Thousand Pillars. Unlike many magical creatures, the 'Adites are not immortal and weaken if they spend too much time outside strong desert Magic auras.

Lone giants emerge from the deep desert to offer their building skills to sorcerers and emirs, in return for insights into the secrets of eternal life.

A giant of 'Ad is balanced as a starting character, albeit a powerful initial Companion option. This character guide has 295 Experience Points available to spend on Abilities and 5 Virtue points free (to be balanced with 5 points of Flaws). His falcon companion may be either mundane or magical, although proportionately larger (up to Size +3) and has its statistics adjusted accordingly.


## *Chapter Seven*

# *Mythic Mesopotamia*

This chapter covers the political center and northwest provinces of the Sunni Muslim world, most of the rulers of which proclaim at least nominal allegiance to the 'Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. However, in most areas provincial governors reign as independent rulers, only seeking approval from the caliph when it helps to bolster their claims to legitimacy.

The terrain of this region is divided broadly into three zones. In Iraq and much of the Jazira, especially between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, are fertile plains where agriculture flourishes; in Iraq, in particular, many of these plains benefit from being irrigated by a network of canals thousands of years old, though recent geological changes, combined with the little effort made by the government to address the effects of these or maintain the existing network, have sharply reduced their productivity. To the north, east, and northwest of these plains, the terrain becomes more mountainous, making cultivation more

## *Aladlammu and Apsasu*

**Faerie Might:** 30 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Int +1, Per +1, Pre +1, Com +1, Str +8, Sta +2, Dex +2, Qik –2

**Size:** +4

**Confidence Score:** 1 (3)

**Personality Traits:** Hatred for demons\* +3, Helpful +2

**Reputations:** Foe of Demons 2 (Local) **Combat:**

*Trample*: Init 0, Attack +12, Defense +8, Damage +14

**Soak:** +8

**Wound Penalties**: –1 (1–9), –3 (10–18), –5 (19–27), Incapacitated (28–36), Dead (37+)

**Pretenses:** Awareness 3 (alertness), Brawl 7 (hooves), Chirurgy 2 (heatstroke), Folk Ken 4 (spotting the possessed), Infernal Lore 4 (disease spirits), Second Sight 5 (demons)

**Powers:**

*Burn The Filthy Spirit*, 0 points, Init –5, Vim: By making eye contact with a demon (whether through normal sight or Second Sight), the aladlammu can strip it of 15 Might. PeVi 10 (Base 5, +1 Eye) Lesser Power (10 levels, –2 Might cost, +1 Init)

*Repel the Nightstalking Spirit*, 1 point, Init –4, Vim: The aladlammu can designate a room or area of clear ground to be safe from demons. If there are no clear pre-existing boundaries, the creature must mark the protected area somehow to create an unbroken line, although this need not be a circle. If the power has a sufficient Penetration Total, no demon with an Infernal Might of 25 or less may enter this designated area. ReVi 30 (Base 25, +1 unusual Target) Greater Power (30 levels, –2 Might cost, +10 experience points in Penetration)

*Restoration of the Defiled Body*, 3 points, Init –11, Corpus: as per the spell of the same name (**ArM5**, page 129). As a ritual power, this power requires a permanent reduction in Might Score as well as Might points. CrCo 25 (Base 20, +1 Touch) Ritual Power (25 levels, –2 Might cost, +15 experience points in Penetration)

**Vis:** 6 pawns of Animal, in hooves

**Appearance:** The aladlammu has the body of a mighty bull, an immense pair of wings, and a bearded human head. The apsasu have a similar appearance, but their heads are female. When they strike with their hooves against an opponent, sparks fly.

The aladlammu and apsasu are guardian creatures created by the gods of old, male and female respectively. Creatures with the same characteristics, but with winged human bodies to match their heads are called *shedu* if male, or *lamassu* if female. Colossal effigies of these beasts can be found among many major ruins of the ancient Middle East. They are fierce opponents of harmful spirits, and a region lucky enough to have an effigy can evoke the faerie to assist them if plagued by disease or demons. A character with an appropriate Area Lore and Faerie Lore can construct an amulet that constitutes an aladlammu's Sovereign Ward (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 52).

These creatures are not suitable as player characters.


## *Demons of Mesopotamia*

Mythic Mesopotamia throngs with demons, some of whom have been active since ancient times. The *uttuku* are a local form of Mazzikim (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 73), and are Infernal jinn (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). The *galla*-demons are powerful disease spirits similar to the Decani (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 52), and are specifically opposed by the Aladlammu (see later). The *lilu* are a form of ghul who haunt the wastes of Mythic Mesopotamia, and are especially dangerous to children and pregnant women. Their female counterparts are the *lilitu*, who are succubi (*Realms of Power: The Infer-* *nal*, page 55). Finally, the *gidim* are Infernal ghosts, specifically Reveners (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 75) who return to torment bereaved families.

*The Cradle & The Crescent*

Among those who still worship the old gods (such as in Harran or Mardin) there is a class of priest-magicians called the *ashipu*, or exorcists. The practices of most ashipu consist of knowledge of the weaknesses of demons (through the Infernal Lore Ability), and how to construct protective amulets that counteract them. Some ashipu may have more active powers against demons, and may be members of the Suhhar Sulayman.

difficult, although valleys provide areas where crops may be grown. Meanwhile, to the west lies the great Syrian desert that divides Mesopotamia from Syria and the Holy Land; this desert also merges to the south with the Nefud of Arabia.

Most of the inhabitants of these regions are Muslims, although there are also significant populations of Christians and Jews. The majority of people live in the cities, towns, and villages that cover the area, but the desert areas are home to a mix of wandering nomads and settled communities at oases.

*The Starving Gods*

The great gods, the Anunna, Stayed parched and famished.[…] But, like sheep, could only fill their windpipes (with bleating). Thirsty as they were, their lips Discharged only the rime of famine.[…] (Atrahasis) put down… Provided food… The gods smelt the fragrance, Gathered like flies over the offering. *— Atrahasis,* Tablet 3

The gods of ancient Mesopotamia, as ancient Faerie creatures, offer interesting possibilities as antagonists in sagas and stories. Faeries ultimately depend on human involvement with them to gain vitality, especially through the retelling of stories in which they are characters. However, the gods of ancient Mesopotamia have been largely abandoned by their worshipers. Nevertheless, the religion persists in scattered cult centers throughout Iraq and the Jazira, notably Harran, Mardin, Ashshur, and Mosul. Although not sanctioned by Islam, the priests (many of them yatus — see Mythic Persia) walk without fear through the streets in their distinctive tall conical hats and tunics. These pitifully few worshipers are woefully insufficient to sate the gods, who have been forced to remain in hidden regiones for centuries. Literally starved of human interaction, they are desperate for attention and may by now not be too discriminating about how this attention is gained. Some may have grand ambitions of having their cults resurrected. Others may simply seek to make friends with player characters, though their means of doing so may at times demonstrate a lack of understanding of human emotions, perhaps becoming aggressive or worse if their initial overtures are rebuffed.

The following represents a selection of the deities worshiped in ancient Mesopotamia:



**Ea:** God of subterranean freshwater ocean; god of arts, crafts, magic, and wisdom; cult center at Eridu.

**Ellil:** God of the earth; head of the younger gods (Igigi), and keeper of an object of supreme power known as the Tablet of Destinies; cult center at Nippur.

**Ishtar:** Goddess of fertility, sexual love, and war; cult centers at Uruk, Nineveh, and Erbil.

**Dumuzi:** God of flocks and agriculture; lover of Ishtar, for whom he spends six months every year in the Underworld.

**Adad:** Storm god and canal controller; lord of omens and divination using animal livers; cult center at Aleppo.

**Mami:** Great mother goddess; cult center at Kesh (unknown site in central Mesopotamia).

**Nergal:** God of war, plague, and forest fires; king of the Underworld; cult center at Kutha.

**Ereshkigal:** Weeping queen of the Underworld; wife of Nergal; cult center at Kutha.

**Sin:** Moon god; god of wisdom; cult centers at Ur and Harran.

**Shamash:** Sun god; god of justice; cult centers at Sippar and Larsa.

**Marduk:** Patron deity of Babylonia; king of the gods; cult center at Babylon

**Ashshur:** Patron deity of Assyria; king of the gods; cult center at Ashshur.

## *Tiamat's Creatures*

In the Babylonian Epic of Creation, the primordial Tiamat engendered the line of gods with her consort Apsu, but later grew distressed by the tumult of the younger gods, and produced 11 races of monsters to exterminate them. Eventually she was killed by Marduk the champion-god, and the world was made from her corpse. Those who have studied the Magic Realm might recognize this myth as a version of the Titanomachia (*Realms of Power: Magic*, page 108), where a race of faerie gods wrests power from primordial Magic beings.

Following the demise of their mother, the eleven types of monsters were pressed into the service of the gods. Those gods may now be fading in power, but their servants can still be found performing their ancient duties. These monsters are: the *mushmahhu* (a seven-headed dragon), the *ushumgallu* (a lion-dragon), the *bashmu* (a horned snake 60 leagues in length), the *mushhushshu* (a snake-dragon; see later), the *lahamu* (a giant covered in long curly hair), the *ugallu* (a man-like creature with a lion's head and tail, and bird's feet), the *uridimmu* (a man with the hindquarters of a lion), the *girtablulla* (scorpion-man; see later), the *umu dabrutu* (a fierce storm), the *kulullu* (a merman, half man, half fish), and the *kusarikka* (a man with the hindquarters of a bull, and bull horns).

#### **Powers:**

*Venom*, 0 points, Init n/a, Corpus: the sting of the scorpion-man's tail contains a potent venom. Characters struck must make a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 or take a Heavy Wound. The sting is treated as a weapon, so this power has no Initiative score. PeCo 20 (base 15, +1 Touch) Lesser Power (20 levels, –4 Might cost, +10 experience in Penetration)

**Equipment:** bow, quiver of 11 arrows, lamellar armor (equivalent to full metal-reinforced leather)

**Encumbrance**: 0 (3)

**Vis:** 3 pawns of Perdo, in sting

**Appearance:** From the waist up, appears as a human warrior, with long hair and a braided beard. From the waist down, the girtablullu has the shiny black carapace of a scorpion, including its long tail equipped with a stinger. It stands on two clawed legs like those of a bird, and carries a bow. Some scorpion-men have birdlike wings.

The gods appropriated the girtablullu as guardians of monuments and sacred places, and they are particularly associated with the sun god Shamash. Consequently, these scorpion-men are encountered by those who investigate the ruins left behind by cultures past. Girtablullu are usually found in small groups, which constitute a Trained Group. They are most powerful during the day, suffering from the Poor Eyesight, No Sense of Direction, and Clumsy Flaws when encountered at night.


## *Mushhushshu*

**Magic Might:** 25 (Animal)

**Season:** Summer

**Characteristics:** Int +2, Per 0, Pre +2, Com 0, Str +6, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik –1

**Size:** +3

**Personality Traits:** Vain +6, Aloof +2, Thirst for Knowledge +2

**Reputations:** Violent against Foreigners 2 (Local)

#### **Combat:**

*Bite\**: Init –1, Attack +18, Defense +9, Damage +9

*Claws\**: Init –1, Attack +14, Defense +10, Damage +10

\* Because of the sinuous body of the mushhushshu, it can attack with both claws and bite in the same round.

**Soak:** +15

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0, –1, –3, –5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties**: –1 (1–8), –3 (9–16), –5 (17–24), Incapacitated (25–32), Dead (33+)

**Abilities:** Arabic 4 (Maslawi), Assyria Lore 4 (magical places), Awareness 3 (invaders), Babylonian 5 (Assyrian), Brawl 6+2 (bite), Concentration 3 (*Eye of the Serpent*), Hunt 4 (interlopers), Infernal Lore 3 (local demons), Intrigue 3 (politics), Faerie Lore 2 (servants of deities), Magic Lore 4 (local spirits), Mesopotamia Lore 4 (Old Babylonia), Penetration 4 (*Voice of Regal Authority*), Second Sight 4 (spirits)

#### **Powers:**

*Assessing Gaze*, 1 point, Init –10, Corpus: The mushhushshu can determine which of a group of humans poses it the greatest threat. This usually reveals who is the most competent warrior, but can also detect the presence (although not strength) of magic. InCo(Vi) 25 (Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Group, +1 requisite) Lesser Power (25 levels, –4 Might cost and +1 Init from Improved Powers)

*Voice of Regal Authority*, 1 point, constant, Mentem: Anyone hearing the voice of the mushhushshu is strongly inclined to obey its commands. ReMe 35 (Base 5, +2 Sun, +3 Sound, +1 constant effect) Greater Power (35 levels, –3 Might cost)

*Eye of the Serpent*, 1 point, Init –6, Corpus: The mushhushshu can transfix a person with a glance, leaving him incapable of movement. ReCo 15 (Base 5, +1 Eye, +1 Conc) Lesser Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost, +5 Init from Improved Powers)

**Vis:** 5 pawns of Vim, in horns

**Appearance:** The mushhushshu has the sinuous body of a snake, although it has four legs like a dragon; the forelegs are like those of a lion, and the hindlegs like those of an eagle. Its head has both horns and a splendid crest.

After the death of their mother Tiamat, the mushhushshu (moosh-chooshshoo, where the "ch" is pronounced as in "loch") were assigned to Ashshur, the patron of Assyria. His priesthood were capable of summoning and controlling the mushhushshu, and there may be yatus in Harran (see later) who are still able to do so. Unless summoned, the mushhushshu roam through the hills and desert fringes of old Assyria, traveling between Magic auras and regiones. They are prone to attack any armed foreigners within the borders of Assyria, but can be forestalled from attacking by offering interesting information or important news. Before battle, if possible, the creature uses its *Assessing Gaze* power to determine the target for its *Eye of the Serpent* power.

# *Iraq*

There have been human settlements in Iraq for thousands of years, and this continues to be the case in 1220, especially along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The ancient Faerie gods who used to rule over this land are no longer seen abroad, though remains of their ziggurat temples still tower into the sky to mystify passersby. Now Iraq is the political center of the Muslim world, a status it has held, with varying degrees of actual authority, since the 'Abbasid takeover in 750. Soon after this event, the 'Abbasids built their capital at Baghdad, from which they have reigned almost continuously ever since. For much of the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries, the 'Abbasid caliphs were figureheads under the control of their deputies, but since the reign of the caliph al-Muqtafi (r. 1136– 1160) the caliphs have been able to resist control by others and rule Iraq independently. As noted earlier, the current caliph, al-Nasir, is a strong ruler; at times his direct authority has also been acknowledged in the Jazira and parts of Persia, and many rulers of the provinces respect his authority, in name at least.

## *Qasr Shirin*

Overlooked by the mountains of the Persian plateau, Qasr Shirin ("the palace of Shirin") is a large walled village on the road to Jibal province. It takes its name from Shirin, the wife of the Persian king Khusraw II Parviz, who used to dwell here. The ruins of her palace remain, and on nights when the moon is full, the palace comes alive with Faerie versions of Shirin, Khusraw, the sculptor Farhad, and the rest of their court, eternally re-enacting the story of the courtship of Shirin. Characters who visit the site at the full moon take on the roles of characters in this


## *The Cradle & The Crescent Samarra*

tale, gaining rewards or wisdom from their participation therein. A character might become Shirin, sought after by two men and unsure which of them to love; she might become Khusraw, the king, who expects to receive all that he desires and is bemused when he is unable to gain what he wants through the force of his position alone; or he might become Farhad, jockeying for Shirin's affections even though his rival is the all-powerful king of Persia. Perhaps a trio of characters might take on all three roles, interacting with each other in ways that they would not do in their regular lives.

The capital of the 'Abbasid caliphs between 836 and 892, the city of Samarra used to be a sprawling complex of richly decorated palaces and mosques on both sides of the Tigris, where for most of that time the caliphs were virtual prisoners of bodyguards who in the meantime fought each other for control of their masters. However, after the caliphs returned to Baghdad the city fell into disrepair, and most of its buildings are now ruins. The major exception is the Great Mosque of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861), an immense structure that is largely intact and is particularly well known for its spiral minaret, which towers about 180 feet above the ground.

In 1220 the majority of the inhabitants of Samarra are Twelver Shi'is (*Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 112), who have remained in the city as it is home to the tombs of the 10th and 11th imams, as well a mosque with an underground chamber where the 12th imam vanished, which is also one of two places where he may reappear at the end of time (the other being Hilla, described later). Thus these Shi'is await his return here.

## *The Courtship of Shirin*

The Persian tale of Khusraw and Shirin is best known in the version by the poet al-Nizami (d. 1209). Khusraw II, the King of Persia, falls in love with Shirin, an Armenian Christian princess. However, their courtship encounters difficulties, at which point there appears a rival for Shirin's affections, the supernaturally strong sculptor Farhad. Khusraw and Farhad contest with each other, and the rivalry grows intense. Eventually Khusraw is able to get rid of his rival by ordering him to cut away the Behistun cliffs in the Zagros Mountains to find water, a seemingly impossible task. Khusraw is briefly taken aback when news reaches him that Farhad has completed the task, so he sends a message to Farhad that Shirin has died. Farhad, distraught, throws himself from the cliffs to his death. Before doing so, he throws away his axe, made of pomegranate wood, and where it falls there grows a pomegranate tree, the fruit of which will cure any illness. Meanwhile Khusraw's courtship of Shirin continues, and after he has proven himself through many acts of heroism, including killing a lion with his bare hands to save her life, she finally consents to marry him.

## *Story Seeds for Samarra and Baghdad*

#### **A Samarran Covenant**

While parts of the city of Samarra are holy sites, it is a sprawling complex of buildings covering a wide area, and it may be that parts of it hide Magic auras and devices left behind from the activities of sorcerers at the courts of the caliphs. Thus it could be an attractive place to set up a covenant, particularly as even though the buildings are ruined, the underlying structures (wells, irrigation canals, etc.) remain largely intact. The major question is how the current mundane population of the city would react to a bunch of foreign wizards setting up home nearby.

**The Wandering Caliph**

From a scant few years after his death right up to the current day, the Suhhar Sulayman have heard tales of encounters with Harun al-Rashid. These encounters start innocuously enough, as a chance conversation with three strangers, but usually blossom into strange and fantastical adventures in Golden Baghdad. Many sahirs believe this Harun al-Rashid (accompanied by his vizier and executioner) to be the faerie ruler of Golden Baghdad, and those whom he invites across the Threshold into the Faerie Realm are chosen based on a contribution they can make to the betterment of his city.

## *Baghdad*

Baghdad is the political center of Islam, insofar as it is the seat of the caliph, even though the caliph's political reach is actually fairly limited. Founded by the second 'Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (r. 754–75), the city has been home to the caliphs for most of the 458 years that have passed since its first stones were laid in 762. The oldest part of Baghdad is the Round City, the original triple-walled city founded on the west bank of the Tigris by al-Mansur, at the center of which lies the Bab al-Dhahab (Golden Gate) palace, which was the first caliphal palace. Over the next two centuries, the caliphs expanded the city on both sides of the river, building mosques, palaces, and gardens, so that it enjoyed a summer of intellectual and cultural achievement.

However, Baghdad has declined greatly since the old days. Repeated fires, floods and civil conflict have left much of it in ruins. On the west bank, each of the quarters is isolated from the others by walls and surrounded by a wasteland of architectural remains. On the east bank, the quarters around the caliph's palace are prospering, but this only comprises a third of the city. Sectarian dissent between Shi'is and Sunnis, and also among different Sunni schools of law, are a cause of internal tension, which occasionally turns into violence. The major social group in the city unaffected by the decline is the Muslim mystic Sufis (SOOfeez), who are flourishing as a result of the building of several *ribats* (ri-BAWTZ),

or hospices, for them by the caliphs. The caliphs have also been building or restoring a number of other religious institutions, including the city's many mosques, shrines, and religious colleges, in an attempt to ease tensions, remove the divisions in the community, and promote a cultural revival.

Every summer, many of the streets and most of the open land on the south side of Baghdad fills with stalls and tents in an enormous fair. This event is well-attended by merchants and travelers from all over the Mythic Middle East, and typically lasts most of the season. It is said that all manner of goods and services may be found at this event, including unique items and entertainments brought by strange men from fantastic lands. Visitors are cautioned to maintain a clear idea of what they seek before they go exploring, for there are said to be many vendors who appear only when their wares are especially desired, or who lure unwary travelers into their tents where they disappear forever. The summer bazaar is the site of the yearly meeting of the Suhhar Sulayman (Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman: The Majlis al-Suleiman).

#### **The Dar al-Hikma**

More Solomonic sahirs live in Baghdad than anywhere else in the world — easily a thousand of them. The city is home to no less than eight buyut al-hikma, including the great academy that sahirs call Dar al-Hikma, which was originally established by the First Council in Baghdad, north of the palace and halfway between the Bab al-Sham and the Bab al-Khurasan. This large building currently houses nearly a hundred young and old sahirs living and studying together, and is overseen by Niya al-Waziriyya al-Jabr Satefa al-Inshai al-Qasri al-Qalb. It is known to have an exceptional astrological observatory, with perhaps the finest astrolabe ever constructed to date, and the architecture is as grand as that of the Bab al-Dhahab Palace and Mosque.

The Dar al-Hikma typically chooses its leader, and thus the representative for Majlis, based on the achievements of those who attend the academy. Niya has discovered a unique method of combining her Solomonic arts, yielding two spells that allow her to summon a spirit directly

from the Magic Realm and to summon multiple spirits at once. For this reason, she was chosen by the other sahirs to lead the bayt, despite her relative youth and the fact that she has The Gift. She will probably become Asala of the Ashab al-Qalb once her predecessor dies. She is said to believe that the Suhhar has stagnated, and that Gifted sahirs (in both senses) are its best hope to avoid extinction. This is a controversial position, as less than ten percent of the Suhhar have The Gift and Gifted sahirs are not generally admired.

#### **Golden Baghdad**

As noted previously, Baghdad enjoyed its time of greatest prosperity during the reign of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, and this period has left its mark on the city. Scattered across Baghdad are numerous places where it is possible to cross into a Faerie version of the city. Here the roofs are covered with gold, the streets are paved with marble and the tales of the *Arabian Nights* are re-enacted, with or without the participation of visitors. Here it is possible to receive a visit at night from the caliph Harun al-Rashid, his vizier Ja'far the Barmakid, and his executioner, Masrur the eunuch, who frequently venture out in disguise to observe the behavior of the city's inhabitants, rewarding the good and punishing the bad. Here one might find oneself eavesdropping on Sinbad the Sailor as he recounts his adventures to Sinbad the Porter. One might even travel beyond the walls of the city, going fishing with Judar the fisherman, seeking the ring of Solo-

**The Ruined Palace**

The imperial palace at Ctesiphon is remarkable for the vaulted arch over the remains of what used to be the Persian emperor's throne room, which is over 110 feet tall at its highest point. This is of great interest to practitioners of the Mystery of Hermetic Architecture (*The Mysteries*, pages 97–101). If a character seeks membership in such a cult, he might be asked to investigate the site as part of his Initiation. Otherwise, the characters might be asked to accompany a cult member to Ctesiphon on some pretext. Investigating the site presents its own challenges though, as the people are likely to be suspicious of foreign strangers poking around in the ruins of the palace.

**The Enemies of Dayr al-'Aqul**

Who is diverting the Tigris River? The characters get involved when they are caught in a sudden change of direction of the river, and are rescued by the monks of Dayr al-'Aqul. The sahirs of Dayr Qunna may be keen to restrict the spread of the Dominion near their fortress, so they have a motive. In addition, if any of the sahirs have summoned spirits that are stronger than they can control, these may be trying to make trouble for their summoners. Alternatively, the culprit may be at Dayr Hizqil. Perhaps the monks there would like to claim the income from the toll levied on the Tigris traffic, in which case they may, with supernatural aid, be trying to cause trouble for either or both of the other monasteries. Or perhaps one of the inmates is to blame. Unbeknownst to the monks of Dayr Hizqil, the sahirs of Dayr Qunna recently dropped off at the madhouse one of their own who had summoned forces greater than he could control, which blasted his mind and destroyed his sanity; perhaps he has now attained enough coherence to seek revenge. Or maybe an enemy sorcerer is hiding at Dayr Hizqil, merely feigning insanity to allow him to direct magical attacks on Dayr al-'Aqul and Dayr Qunna. Finally, perhaps a demon or faerie is the one making trouble, thriving off the reactions of the mortals involved.

mon with Bulukiyya, or helping Hasan, the goldsmith of Basra, to obtain the love of a jinn maiden. It is also possible to take the role of one of these characters, experiencing their adventures firsthand.

The entrances to Golden Baghdad may take any form, from a simple mundane doorway that happens to lead there, to an invisible gate that can only be perceived by those with Second Sight, Faerie Sight, or similar magic or powers. It is entirely possible to stray through such entrances into the Faerie Realm (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 20) without initially being aware that one has done so, especially in cases where the Guardian actually forms part of the Threshold. Indeed, straying into Golden Baghdad by accident is a common enough hazard that it is an acceptable excuse for absence among the people of the mundane version of the city, and most people in mundane Baghdad have visited Golden Baghdad at least once. Members of the Suhhar Sulayman have attempted to map the entrances to Golden Baghdad, but entrances behave differently for different people, and most appear, disappear, and change, seemingly at random, with the result that only a small number of relatively stable entrances have been identified with any certainty. Members of the Suhhar also debate whether supernatural creatures found in mundane Baghdad are native to the mundane world, or are visitors from Golden Baghdad who have strayed the other way through such portals.

## *Al-Mada'in*

Al-Mada'in is a small but densely-populated town to the southeast of Baghdad. In the seventh and eighth centuries it was a much larger complex of seven towns, but over the years it has gradually declined. It is still much admired for its mosque, near which is the tomb of Salman the Persian, an important companion of the Prophet. Al-Mada'in is also the site of the ancient ruins of Ctesiphon, the Persian imperial capital, and the ruins of the imperial palace still remain as witnesses to the passing of Sassanid power.

## *The Christian Monasteries*

Downriver from al-Mada'in are three Nestorian Christian monasteries (*adyar* (ad-YAHR), sing. *dayr*) that are unknowingly interconnected. They each have their own unique features and are described as follows.

#### **Dayr al-'Aqul**

Located on the banks of the Tigris, the monastery of Dayr al-'Aqul is surrounded by a fairly large town of the same name, which includes a major mosque. Here the monks levy a toll from river traffic, which they share with the townsfolk, making it a major source of income for the town as a whole. However, recently the monks have noticed that rapid changes are taking place in the river's banks, with the result that the river is gradually drawing away to the west, which means that they may soon be cut off from the source of their livelihood. All attempts to prevent these changes have failed, and both the monks and the townsfolk suspect that some supernatural force may be involved. They have been unable thus far to identify their enemy, but some suspect that the monks of the monastery of Dayr Qunna may in fact be foul sorcerers seeking the destruction of Dayr al-'Aqul.

#### **Dayr Qunna**

A mile to the east lies the monastery of Dayr Qunna, which is a large building with walls that are so strong and high that the monastery resembles a fortress. This is perhaps not entirely surprising, as the building is not actually a monastery but a bayt al-



hikma inhabited by members of the Suhhar Sulayman and their followers, posted here to keep an eye on the caliphs and posing as Nestorian monks in the meantime.

#### **Dayr Hizqil**

20 miles south of Dayr al-'Aqul is the town of al-Nu'maniyya, within which is the monastery of Dayr Hizqil. Here the monks maintain a madhouse, caring for those who have been afflicted with insanity. To work in such a place requires a strong mental and physical constitution, and the monks are mostly down-to-earth, brawny types who are well-capable of manhandling their charges if need be.

## *The Ruins of Babylon*

"And you, Belshazzar his son, have not humbled your heart, even though you knew all this! You have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven! The vessels of his temple have been brought in before you, and you and your lords, your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or know; but the God in whose power is your very breath, and to whom belong all your ways, you have not honored." […] That very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was killed.

> *— The Bible,* Daniel 5: 22–23 and 30

The city of Babylon, in southern Iraq, has been the site of many dramatic events of history. It witnessed the chaining of Harut and Marut, the angels who taught magic to humans and now hang bound beneath the ruined city; the building of the Tower of Babel; the exile of the Jews; the construction of the Hanging Gardens by Nebuchadnezzar; and the subsequent destruction of the city and Belshazzar's kingdom by the Persians. As such, it is a site of great potential interest to explorers. More details on Babylon and its mysteries may be found in *Ancient Magic*, pages 12–15.

## *The Epic of Gilgamesh*

Of him who found out all things, I shall tell the land,

Of him who experienced everything, I shall teach the whole.

He searched lands everywhere.

He who experienced the whole gained complete wisdom.

He found out what was secret and uncovered what was hidden.

He brought back a tale of times before the Flood.

He had journeyed far and wide, weary and at last resigned,

He engraved all toils on a memorial monument of stone.

He had the wall of Uruk built, the sheepfold

Of holiest Eanna, the pure treasury.  *— The Epic of Gilgamesh,*  Tablet 1

The ancient Mesopotamian *Epic of Gilgamesh* attained its final form in the eighth or seventh century BC, though it owes its origins to a variety of much older stories about the mythological king of the city of Uruk, who may be based on a real person who ruled two millennia earlier. It tells the tale of King Gilgamesh and his friend Enkidu, who adventure together until they are cruelly torn apart by the vengeance of the gods. There are actually three known major variants of the tale; the following is a very brief summary of the most popular version.

King Gilgamesh of Uruk is an unpopular ruler, and the gods send him Enkidu, a wild man, to distract him. Enkidu is tamed by Shamhat the temple prostitute, and after a wrestling match in which neither wins, Gilgamesh and Enkidu become close friends. Seeking fame and honor, the pair go to the Pine Forest to slay the monster Humbaba. Upon return to Uruk, the goddess Ishtar tries to seduce Gilgamesh, but he rejects her. In a rage, she brings the destructive bull of heaven to attack Gilgamesh and Enkidu, but they slay it and insult Ishtar. The gods decide that the pair have gone too far and strike Enkidu with a fatal illness.

The distraught Gilgamesh takes to

wandering in the wilderness. He makes it as far as the gate through the mountains that guard the sunrise, where he is permitted to pass by the humanoid scorpions that guard it. Beyond, he meets Siduri the alewife, who advises him to go home and make the most of this life, since the afterlife is nothing to look forward to. Gilgamesh is undeterred, and he obtains directions from Siduri to the abode of Utnapishtim, a mortal king who was made immortal by the gods after he survived the great flood. Gilgamesh fails to obtain immortality from Utnapishtim, and is instead forced to return to Uruk with only the wisdom that he has gained on his journey. This is sufficient to make him a good king.

Characters who take on the role of Enkidu in this story, then, are doomed to die. This is something that may be known to some of the players, even though it is highly unlikely that any of the characters will know it. Any player who, despite knowing the fate that lies in store, still has her character adopt Enkidu's role and allows the character to be killed not only achieves an Unmitigated Success in re-enacting the story, but should also receive an extra Confidence Point as a reward for bravery at the end of the session.

Ancient Mesopotamians did not believe that death meant the complete end of existence, but rather that the human soul was transported to a dry, dusty underworld where the dead led a miserable, dreary existence: essentially a place devoid of vitality. To faeries, the deserted Temple of Uruk, abandoned by humans, is a symbol of such a place, and any character who has died as Enkidu thus finds himself sent through the Guardian portal back to the temple, alive and having gained whatever he sought.

Storyguides may wish to draw out the suspense by having any companions of the dead character complete the remaining story of Gilgamesh's travels before they also are returned to the temple, where they will find their apparently deceased comrade alive.


## *The Great Swamp*

South of Babylon lies the Great Swamp, a marshy area that stretches between the two rivers until they join further south. Despite a noxious atmosphere and frequent plagues of insects, the swamp is dotted with villages and towns inhabited by determined souls who have managed to drain small patches of land and grow crops on them. Navigation through the swamp is primarily achieved using shallow-drafted boats. The inhabitants of these swamps are pagan followers of the old religion, although in the absence of a formal priesthood they have but fragments of their faith left to them. One tale they do know, and have faithfully recited for generations, is the Epic of Gilgamesh (see previous page).

#### **The Ruins of Uruk**

In the center of the Great Swamp rise the ruins of a mighty stepped ziggurat, all that remains of a great temple to the goddess Ishtar. Local people stay clear of the site, since some of those who visited it have never returned. The temple has a Faerie aura of 2. In addition, explorers who break through a rubble-strewn doorway (actually a Faerie Guardian) find themselves inadvertently passing through an entrance to the Faerie Realm of Elysium. The Threshold Strength here is 33, but those who visit the temple and cross the doorway automatically accumulate the requisite number of Threshold Points (major border (12) + trod (the doorway, aura 5) + any temporal thresholds + any personal thresholds + any shortfall made up by the Guardian's Spirit Away Faerie Power). See *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 18–21.

Upon entering the Faerie Realm, characters encounter Gilgamesh, who seeks to make one or all of them identify with Enkidu, taking on his role in this tale; this sets them on the Path of Destiny (see *Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 33). If they agree, Gilgamesh sends the characters out into the wilds, there to await the arrival of Shamhat.


On the north side of a canal leading into the Shatt al-'Arab lies the town of Ubulla, a busy settlement with palaces, mosques and markets. However, in the late eighth century the town was plagued by a vicious jinni, who took the form of a whirlpool in the Shatt al-'Arab and wrecked any ships that came within its reach, thus blocking the trade route between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf . The jinni was only defeated through the cleverness of Zubayda bint Ja'far, the wife of Harun al-Rashid. She discovered through her studies that the jinni in question was vulnerable to stone, so she had a large number of ships loaded with stones, floated to the whirlpool, and then sunk, filling the jinni's maw and burying it in the riverbed, thus calming the waters and enabling ships to travel the Shatt al- 'Arab once more.

## *Basra*

Located on two canals leading into the Shatt al-'Arab, Basra is an important city in southern Iraq. It contains numerous shrines and mosques, the best known of which is the mosque built by 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, which has a minaret that shakes or remains still depending on whether an oath sworn before it is true or false. This is a miraculous effect, and cannot be fooled or resisted. Basra is also well-known for its library, which reputedly contains over 15,000 books.

## *Kutha*

Within the town of Kutha stands an immense tower of solidified ashes, all that remains of a furnace built by the ancient tyrant King Nimrod, the builder who also built the Tower of Babel. Nimrod attempted to kill Abraham by hurling him into this furnace, despite the fact that Abraham was the son of his vizier Terah, but God commanded the flames to be cool, and Abraham walked out unharmed. Meanwhile, the furnace itself was consumed by the flames, and only the Tower of Ashes remains.


## *Karbala'*

Karbala' is a site associated with a traumatic event in Muslim history, having witnessed the violent end to one of the first Shi'i revolts against the Umayyad dynasty. In 680 al-Husayn, the son of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and grandson of the Prophet, sought to advance his claim to the caliphate after the death of the caliph Mu'awiya. However, he and his followers were intercepted and slain at Karbala' in the desert by Umayyad troops. This event sent an emotional shockwave through the Muslim world; this was, after all, the Prophet's *grandson*. The event is still remembered with regret by all Muslims and particularly mourned by Shi'is, who hold ceremonies commemorating the event on the day of 'Ashura' (('ah-shoo-REH'), "the Tenth"), the 10th day of the Muslim month of Muharram (mu-HAR-ram).

Karbala' is now home to a small town, at the center of which is the tomb where al-Husayn's body is interred (his head is in Cairo), which is a major place of pilgrimage for Shi'is. It takes the form of a domed shrine surrounded by a garden pool. The gateway of the shrine itself is made of silver, while inside the tomb is lit by golden and silver lamps. The other doorways in the shrine are closed off by curtains of silk. Pilgrims coming to the tomb kiss the silver gateway before entering to pray. The tomb has a Dominion aura of 8, and visitors may attempt to invoke baraka from al-Husayn's tomb in the form of any of the following Saint Powers: *Apparition, Acknowledgement of Evil, Expel Demons, Resist Temptation, Grant of Serenity, Straighten the Crippled, The Faithful Made Whole, Celestial Immunity, Mass Healing, Humility of Caesar, Terrify the Unbeliever*. Al-Husayn has a Divine Might of 75. See *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 87–89 and 105, for further details.

## *Hilla*

The city of Hilla occupies both sides of the Euphrates River, though its greater part is found on the western bank. The two sides are joined by a bridge of boats

# *Story Seeds for the Great Swamp*

#### **The Whirlpool at Ubulla**

The jinni at Ubulla is imprisoned on the riverbed, but not slain. The characters get word of a group of sorcerers who are planning to free the creature and use it as a weapon with which to impose their will on the caliph. Should they try to prevent this directly, or should they try to warn the caliph, all the time knowing that the sorcerers back in Ubulla are gradually getting closer to achieving their goal?

#### **The Thief of Basra**

The characters catch someone stealing books on arcane lore from the library at Basra. The thief is taken to the minaret, and there his guilt is confirmed and he is sentenced to have his hand cut off. However, before the punishment is carried out, the thief tells the characters that he was only conducting the theft at the command of a sorcerer who is holding his family hostage. He begs them to gain proof of this so that his crime will be pardoned, as well as to rescue his family and keep them from harm. If the characters agree to help, the local chief *qadi* ((QAW-dee), "judge") gives them a week to obtain the proof required.

Of course, it may be that the thief is in fact lying, and there is no sorcerer or family, in which case the characters return from their wild goose chase only to discover that the thief has escaped and they are now responsible for tracking him down again. This may be a tricky task if the thief also has supernatural powers.

#### **Nimrod's Furnace**

[Abraham] said: Worship ye then instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you?

Fie on you and all that ye worship instead of Allah! Have ye then no sense?

They cried: Burn him and stand by your gods, if ye will be doing.

We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham,

And they wished to set a snare for him, but We made them the greater losers.

And We rescued him and Lot (and brought them) to the land which We have blessed for (all) peoples.

 *— The Qur'an* 21: 66–71

The furnace was originally dedicated to the powers of Hell, and was home to a fiery demon. However, direct intervention from God on Abraham's behalf made it into a holy object and trapped the demon inside to quell the flames. Now, a cabal of corrupted individuals seek to light the fires of Nimrod's Furnace once more, a feat that can only be achieved by weakening of the faith of Kutha's inhabitants, followed by profaning the testament to Abraham's miracle by burning holy men to death within it.

#### **The Scholars of Hilla**

The characters are contacted by a powerful but physically disabled Shi'i sahirs, who asks them to travel to Hilla on his behalf and seek the wisdom of a scholar named Muhammad ibn Muhammad, who makes his home there, providing the characters with a list of questions that they must ask him. However, it quickly becomes clear that there are three scholars with this name in the town, all of whom have wildly varying responses to the questions, and also that relations between these scholars are intensely hostile due to their theological differences. The characters will have to spend a considerable amount of time, and no small amount of tact and diplomatic energy, to gather all three scholars' answers without upsetting any of them (by clearly associating with either of his rivals) and causing them to become uncooperative.

held fast by great iron chains. Hilla contains a shrine where it is said that the twelfth imam will reappear at the end of time, so many Twelver Shi'is live here, awaiting his return. Indeed, Hilla is a center of Twelver Shi'i scholarship, with many religious scholars making their homes in the city.



## *Ighraq al-Siq*

Ighraq al-Siq ("the drowning flood of the gorge") is an ancient pagan spirit of the Tigris, now confined to a gorge on the lower or Lesser Zab, a tributary of the Tigris (also called Majnun, "the mad river") from its impetuous currents. Once able to range freely along the length of the river, he is currently confined to a specific stretch in the lower reaches known as the Siq al-Majnun, or sometimes just "the Jinni's Gorge". He is responsible for the paroxysmal Spring flooding through this narrow canyon. This immediate canyon area has a Magic Aura of 6.

**Powers:**

*Crafter of Water*, 1–8 points, Init 0, Aquam: Duplicates any non-Ritual Creo Aquam or Rego Aquam spell less than or equal to 40th level at the cost of 1 Might point per magnitude of the effect. Ighraq al-Siq can use the Water-way Range (equivalent to Sight) and Body-of-water target (equivalent to Structure) when invoking this power, being able to target anyone or anything on or in his part of the river or affecting the Zab as a whole (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 43).

CrAq 40 or ReAq 40: Focus Power (3 mastery points to increase level by 15).

*Drown*, 0 points, Init –2, Aquam: In Floodwave form only, Ighraq al-Siq can engulf a target whose Size is smaller than his own after a successful melee attack in an attempt to drown it, necessitating a roll to avoid deprivation (**ArM5**, pages 180–181). The victim can attempt to escape from his clutches each round using the Grappling rules (**ArM5**, page 174). (30 levels, 3 Intricacy points spent on reduced Might, 1 point on Initiative)

*Donning the Corporeal Veil*, 2 points, Init +1 (affected by the Slow Power Flaw, takes an additional round of preparation to activate), Corpus; 35 levels: Ighraq al-Siq can form the humanoid body described under Appearance to house his spiritual form; when doing so he acquires the physical characteristics, size, combat statistics, and Wound levels listed earlier. His arms

## *Najaf*

The city of Najaf is of immense importance to Shi'is, as it contains the tomb of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib. As described earlier, 'Ali was killed in 661, an event which took place in Kufa. As he died, he instructed that his body should be put on a camel, which should be turned loose, then followed; where the camel knelt was where he should be buried. This was done, and for a long time his supporters kept the location of his grave secret, fearing that the Umayyads might desecrate the site if they found it. However, in 791 the 'Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid was hunting nearby, and he chased a deer into a thicket and then discovered that neither his horse nor his hounds could enter the spot. He made his servants dig in the thicket, and when they discovered the corpse of 'Ali he ordered a tomb to be built on the spot. This tomb has been refurbished and expanded over the years, and it is now an ornate structure that forms the focal point of the city and sees visits from thousands of pilgrims every year. Najaf is also home to an immense graveyard, where several prophets and numerous important Shi'i nobles are buried. There are also several madrasas, mosques, and other religious institutions here.

The shrine of 'Ali takes the form of a gold-domed structure, on each side of which is a monumental portal with a sil-



and amor are also created with this power. He cannot become fatigued. This body lasts until he decides he no longer needs it. Killing the body does not kill Ighraq al-Siq.

*Grant Water Lore*, 5 points, Qik –13, Vim: Ighraq can grant the Minor Mystery Virtue Water Lore to an individual either temporarily or permanently. Characters granted this Virtue could improve it further through Adventure, Exposure or Experience like any other Nature Lore (see *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*, pages 103– 104). The Source Quality of Ighraq's canyon is normally 4 but magi able to persuade the malevolent jinni to teach them can use the normal Teaching rules as an exception to the usual rule — in this case Ighraq's effective Source Quality is 9.

*Grant Wilding*, 10 points, Qik –23, Vim: Ighraq can grant the Major Mystery Virtue Wilding to an individual with an existing Water Lore score either temporarily or permanently (see *Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults*, pages 105–106).

*Presence*, 0 points, constant, Mentem: Once released, Ighraq al-Siq is aware of everything that goes on within his haunt. This power needs to Penetrate to perceive beings with a Magic Resistance. (35 levels, 3 Mastery points spent on reduced Might)

*Transform into Floodwave*, 4 points Init –4 (affected by the Slow Power Flaw, takes an additional round of preparation to activate), Aquam: Ighraq al-Siq can transform into a floodwave, seemingly drawing on the water of the stream to appear as an elemental. (45 levels)

**Vis:** 2 pawns of Aquam vis can be collected every year from his haunt, in the form of clear rainwater that collects within a niche carved into the stone block that imprisons him. If slain in a physical form or dispersed in elemental, his body yields 8 pawns of Aquam vis within perfectly smooth stones of varied hue.

**Appearance:** Ighraq al-Siq appears as a thin giant with blue-green complexion and straggly green-black hair like water weeds. He carries a large spear and is clad in a vest of watersmoothed stones. Once manifested, this humanoid form can disperse into his preferred elemental form, a floodwave carrying a hail of stones that can travel upriver or downriver along a watercourse as a marauding torrent. The effect of a *Deluge of Rushing and Dashing* when invoked within the narrow confines of the gorge is particularly devastating.

#### **Story Seed: Jinni Blocks**

Since ancient times the spirit Ighraq al-Siq has been trapped inside a Jinni Block — a type of unusual tower tomb placed at the entrances to the ruins of some lost cities. The process may be similar to the Goetic Art of Binding, but an unknown effect triggered by intrusion into the Majnun canyon area releases Ighraq al-Siq from his imprisonment and compels him to drive off intruders. While trapped within the block, Ighraq al-Siq is essentially unable to affect his surroundings in any way and cannot be detected by magic, as he becomes part of the native stone. The stone block is granted the jinni's Magic Resistance, but can still be eroded and broken by the elements and other nonmagical attacks.

Over time, the area immediately surrounding the block has become a fixed Arcane Connection to the spirit, providing a +1 bonus to the Penetration multiplier and replacing his original physical locus. A character who actually stands barefoot on top or touches the prison block is considered to have a stronger Arcane Connection to Ighraq al-Siq, gaining a +3 Penetration multiplier bonus, and also gains the benefit of the entrapped spirit's Magic Resistance. A sahir, summoner, or Hermetic magus can use his magic to attempt to command Ighraq al-Siq using scouring (*Realms of Power: the Infernal*, page 117) or Sihr by standing within the vicinity of the Jinni Block even if he is unaware of his presence. A failed attempt at controlling him, however, will trigger his release and invoke his displeasure.

ver doorstep. It is richly decorated with glazed tiles, thick carpets and gold and silver lamps. The doorways are covered with silk curtains, and silk hangings also adorn the walls inside the structure. The actual tomb itself is surrounded by a railing made of engraved gold plates held together with silver nails. The Dominion aura in the shrine has a score of 8, and visitors may pray for baraka from 'Ali to invoke any of the following Saint Powers: *Acknowledgment of Evil, Apparition,*  *Celestial Immunity, Cure Blindness, Expel Demons, Grant of Serenity, Mass Healing, Resist Temptation, Straighten the Crippled, The Faithful Made Whole, Humility of Caesar, Rebuke the Unfaithful,* and *Terrify the Unbeliever*. The shrine is particularly well known for healing miracles, so attempts to invoke Saint Powers of this type enjoy a +1 bonus. 'Ali has a Divine Might of 75. See *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 87–89, for more.

## *Kufa*

About seven miles northeast of Najaf lies the city of Kufa. This used to be a vibrant settlement, but recently it has declined and much of the city is in ruins; although in the eastern part of the town the Great Mosque of Kufa remains in good condition. This is the mosque where 'Ali was mortally wounded by his killer, and the site of the attack is marked by a mihrab that has been built on the spot. Kufa


continues to be visited by Shi'i pilgrims, usually on the way to or from Najaf.

# *The Jazira*

To the north of Iraq lies the Jazira. Like Iraq, this is mostly a fertile area where agriculture flourishes. Much of the region is ruled by the Ayyubids, who currently spend much of their time intriguing against each other, with the result that those cities that are not ruled directly by them are able to assert their independence, only acknowledging their authority in name. Most of the rulers here, including the Ayyubids, acknowledge the ultimate authority of the caliph, although again this has little real impact on them.

## *Mosul*

Mosul lies on the east bank of the Tigris, opposite the remains of the ancient city of Nineveh. Since 1128 the city has been held by members of the Zangid (ZANG-gid) family, whose progenitor, 'Imad al-Din Zangi (d. 1146) is best known for having taken Edessa from the crusaders in 1144. Currently Mosul is effectively ruled by a Mamluk regent, Badr al-Din Lu'Lu', ruling on the behalf of the emir al-Qahir Mahmud and acknowledging Ayyubid overlordship.

Mosul is defended by a double wall, a strong citadel and, on the east side, the Tigris itself. Outside the walls are suburbs and fertile gardens, while a wide north-south road runs through the city itself. Many of the houses are built of marble. Mosul contains numerous important religious sites, including mosques housing the tombs of Jonah and St. George (who is also a prophet in Islam), a healing spring, a squash tree planted by the Prophet himself, and several madrasas and Christian monasteries. The population here consists of a mixture of Muslims, Christians and Yazidis (on the last, see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 136).

Mosul is particularly well known for its textiles. Indeed, it is from the name of the city that the word "muslin" is derived.

## *Barqa'id*

The city of Barqa'id is avoided by travelers, for it is populated almost entirely by thieves who rob unwitting visitors and prey on caravans passing it

## *Story Seeds for Kufa and the Jazira*

#### **The House of Ibn Muljam**

As indicated in Chapter 2, 'Ali was killed by a political opponent with a poisoned sword. His killer, named 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muljam, was subsequently executed. However, his sword was taken away by associates and buried in a house where he secretly stayed while he was in Kufa, in which it has subsequently spread an Infernal taint while also becoming an object binding 'Abd al-Rahman's ghost to the site. Since then the house has changed hands many times; because of the uncomfortable feeling there, and the many household accidents that occur, it has been labeled as cursed, although the locals do not know why. The house finally passes into the hands of a friend of the characters who has enough insight to realize that there are supernatural forces at work, and he contacts them to ask for their help in discovering and removing the cause of the troubles. However, by the time the characters reach Kufa the spirit has become strong enough to possess their friend. Can they remove the taint and defeat the ghost without harming him?

#### **Tensions in Mosul**

The people of Mosul follow a righteous path, doing pious works. You will meet none of them but has a cheerful countenance and a soft word. They are generous to strangers, receiving them kindly, and using justness in all their dealings with them.

*—* Muhammad ibn Jubayr (d. 1217), *Travels*

The characters are contacted by a magus or sahir who recently traveled to Mosul. The wizard in question, having read the travelogue of Ibn Jubayr, decided to investigate and see if the legendary kindness of the people of the city had a supernatural cause. However, his magical experiments in the city have gone awry, and he has inadvertently set the people against each other, so that civil war is brewing. The wizard has the Blatant Gift, impeding his ability to defuse the tension, so he asks the characters to come and act as mediators between the hostile factions while also helping him to cancel the effects of his magical meddling.

#### **Against the City of Thieves**

The characters are victims of a raid conducted by the people of Barqa'id, and their victory over the thieves is witnessed by the inhabitants of a local village, who offer them succor. When they arrive at the village they find themselves welcomed like heroes, and it quickly becomes evident that the people are expecting them to destroy Barqa'id and rid them of their oppressors. How will the characters respond to these expectations?

#### **The Battle for Nasibin**

Nasibin is actually the site of an invisible battle for souls between an angel and a demon, of which the outward manifestations are the roses and the scorpions. So far, the battle between the two has reached only a stalemate, but either party might decide to try and enlist the aid of the characters. If the characters are taken in by the appeals of the demon, either succumbing to promises of rewards or mistaking the disguised demon for an angel, they may unwittingly find themselves aiding the cause of Hell.


on the road to Nasibin. As a result of its ever-worsening reputation, and the consequent reduction in the number of travelers passing near it, its inhabitants have become ever bolder in their atrocities, attacking other nearby towns and villages, to the point that their victims have appealed to the rulers of Mosul and Nasibin for help; however, each ruler has refused, claiming that it is the other's responsibility and leaving the people to fend for themselves.

## *Nasibin*

An important center of Nestorian Christian scholarship and the seat of a bishop, the city of Nasibin is home to a mixed population of Christians and Muslims. It is famous for its gardens, said to be 40,000 in number and blessed with unusually large and fragrant white roses, but also for its scorpions, which deliver a particularly venomous sting and fill the city in great numbers.

#### **The Astrologers of Nasibin**

For most of the history of the Suhhar Sulayman, Nasibin was home to a great bayt al-hikma known as the House of the Heavens, the seat of the great family of Solomonic astrologers called the Ashab al-Najm. This was a series of five large buildings carved from white stone and placed around a central building that housed an observatory with an astrolabe, with a great procession of statues in the courtyard between them fashioned to represent each of the ancient Babylonian figures associated with the planets and zodiacal constellations.

In the year 1186, however, a fascinating event occurred. It is said that soon after the vizier representing Nasibin and the Asala al-Najm returned to the bayt from that year's Majlis, they and all of the other sahirs of the city departed in a mass exodus. Some of them had made arrangements and had their possessions ready to transport, while others simply set down their work and left whatever they were doing unfinished. This depar-

## *Mount Judi and Mount Ararat*

And it was said: O earth! Swallow thy water and, O sky! Be cleared of clouds! And the water was made to subside. And the commandment was fulfilled. And (the ship) came to rest upon al-Judi and it was said: A far removal for wrongdoing folk!

 *— The Qur'an* 11: 44

And in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. *— The Bible,* Genesis 8: 4

According to the Bible, Noah's ark came to rest upon Mount Ararat in Armenia, something that accords with Christian and Jewish belief, but contradicts Islamic belief. In fact, both groups are right in a sense: the remains of the ark are in a regio that may be reached from either mountain. On Mount Judi it is possible to enter the resting place of the ark from the mosque; characters have merely to walk *through* the mihrab, even though it appears to be made of solid marble, in order to be transported there. For more on Mount Ararat and the resting place of Noah's ark see *Ancient Magic*, pages 70–73.

ture occurred just before the end of summer, and astrologers have calculated that at about that time all seven planets were in the sign of Libra, a rare event that indicates powerful celestial influence in acts of subtlety, independence, and the assistance of others.

Neither the Asala nor the vizier who once led the House of the Heavens have been heard from since, and so have never explained this strange direction the great house suddenly took, but there are now many groups of sahirs who tell different stories and give different reasons. The predominant belief is that they scattered to better assist Salah al-Din in the Battle of Hattin and the recapture of Jerusalem in 1187, though others say they acted to put a plan into place that would remove Rashid al-Din Sinan of the Syrian Nizaris (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia, The Nizari Isma'ili State).

All of the remaining sahirs from Nasibin now travel in roving caravans across the Mythic Middle East, each occasionally stopping in one place or another when the stars seem right. Their mobile laboratories are still more common in Jazira than other regions, being closest to where they came from. Meriq, the current Asala (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia, Savah) maintains that their family bayt is still located in Nasibin, even though no one currently lives there, and supposes that those who left must eventually return there one day.

## *Mount Judi*

Mount Judi is believed by the Muslims to be the final resting place of the Ark of Noah. The mountain is topped by a mosque marking the spot, and at its foot lies the city of Thamanin ("eighty"), said to have been founded by eighty of Noah's companions, whose inhabitants claim descent from this illustrious group.

## *Amid*

The black basalt city of Amid has been massively fortified by its Turkish overlords with thick walls, multiple watchtowers and iron gates. The central portion of the town includes a high hill upon which is built the citadel. Outside of this wall lie the suburbs of the city, again enclosed by fortified wall. The city is home to several religious buildings, including both a major Sunni mosque and a great Jacobite church, both of which are built of black basalt and iron and are renowned for their beauty.

The over-fortification of Amid is the result of repeated attacks on the city made over the centuries by immense armies of Faerie creatures, wielding wood and stone weapons and clad in an ancient and unknown form of leather armor. The precise reason for these attacks is unclear, though


they always take place on the spring equinox. The people of the city have become fatalistically used to preparing for these attacks on a regular basis. On the other hand, the shared foe has proved to be a factor that has led to extremely good relations between the Muslims and Christians of the city.

## *Raqqa and the Battlefield of Siffin*

Once a residence of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, Raqqa is enjoying something of a resurgence under the Ayyubids. Its markets are flourishing, and it is famous for its blue-glazed ceramics. Meanwhile, on the opposite side of the Euphrates from the city is the site of the Battle of Siffin, which was fought between 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan in 657. After several months of skirmishing, Mu'awiya asked his opponent for resolution of their dispute by arbitrators. 'Ali agreed, but some of his followers did not and so abandoned him; Ibn Muljam, who slew 'Ali, was an adherent of this dissenting group.

The supporters of 'Ali who died in the battle are buried here, and it is possible to see through the ground to their uncorrupted bodies from afar. However, when one comes to the places where they lie, the bodies may no longer be seen. The battlefield is a place of holy pilgrimage for Shi'is.


## *Harran*

Currently ruled by the Ayyubids, the city of Harran has an ancient pedigree as the dwelling place of Abraham, and later as the first center of the scholarly movement that began translating many works of Classical scholarship into Arabic in the eighth century. About nine miles south of the city is a shrine marking where Abraham and Sarah dwelled. Harran is also famous as having been the center of a cult of monotheistic star-magicians known as the Sabians, who were first encountered by the Muslims in the ninth century; they are said to have since died out, but some may still exist, posing as Muslims to avoid harassment. Harran is also home to a prominent cult dedicated to the Ashshur, patron god of the Assyrians.

## *Edessa*

The city of Edessa has changed hands many times in its history, having been held variously by the Byzantines, the Muslims, and others. In 1098 it was taken by the crusaders, who made it the capital of one of their four states. However, as noted previously, on Christmas Eve 1144 it was conquered by Zangi, and it is currently under the control of the Ayyubid sultan of Aleppo, al-'Aziz (r. 1216–1236). The majority of the population are Christians of various churches, and its chief claim to fame used to be a Christian relic, the Holy Mandylion — a cloth bearing an image of Christ's face that was sent by him to King Abgar of Edessa. However, this relic was given to the Byzantine Emperor in exchange for prisoners by the Muslim rulers of Edessa in the tenth century, and then lost when the crusaders sacked Constantinople in 1204. What became of the relic remains unknown, but the people of Edessa hope it will be miraculously restored to them someday.

## *More Story Seeds for the Jazira*

#### **The Death of Tenik**

In ancient times there were two chieftains named Tigran and Vasdes. Tigran ruled a village on the site of Amid, while Vasdes ruled another village nearby. One night, Tigran raided the village of Vasdes and took the latter's wife, Tenik, hostage. The following night, the night of the spring equinox, Vasdes led his troops out to rescue his wife and take revenge on Tigran, but Tenik, who wished to prevent further bloodshed, threw herself between the two warbands in an attempt to halt the fighting, meeting an accidental death under her husband's already-swinging club. Horrified, both men called a halt to the conflict and resolved their differences.

The Faeries at Amid seek to re-enact the conflict of Tigran and Vasdes, but they are unable to bring it to its final resolution due to human ignorance of the story. In the meantime, their army, the Faerie manifestation of the warband of Vasdes, has grown as Amid has grown, with the result that it continues to be a threat to the city. The characters learn of the story from a Faerie that lives nearby and realize that the conflict may be brought to an end if someone takes the role of Tenik and falls under Vasdes' axe. Yet how may this be achieved without someone having to die?

#### **The Dead of Siffin**

The identity of one of the corpses buried at Siffin causes concern for the characters.

Perhaps the one of the bodies, from a distance, looks like an ancestor of a character, in which case, why is the ancestor here among the dead? Did an ancestor of the character travel here and become involved in the fighting between 'Ali and Mu'awiya? If the ancestor was in the region for a significant amount of time the character may have other, unknown relatives in the region, waiting to be found. This has even more interesting implications if the character in question is Gifted; perhaps there is a whole magical lineage to which she is related.

Alternatively, maybe the cause for concern is a corpse that, from a distance, resembles a still-living character or one of the characters' associates. Is this a warning of some sort, a premonition of the future?

Of course, with both storylines the characters will need to find ways to observe the corpse in question more closely, to ensure that they are not merely seeing a coincidental resemblance. This can probably be achieved using magic either to gain a closer view of the body or to mark the grave so that they may disinter the corpse. Of course, if they do the latter, they will have to ensure that they are unobserved by people who might object to them disturbing the site.

#### **The Heat Is On**

This is a town with no beauty about it. It has no shade to mitigate its feverish heat, and its climate follows from its name (*harran*, "hot"). Its water bears no acquaintance with freshness, and its squares and outskirts never cease to burn from the heat of its midday sun. No noontime place of rest will you find there, and you will breathe no air that is not heavy. Thrown into the naked waste, it has been founded in the midst of the wilderness and, without the brightness of a city, its shoulders have been stripped of the clothing of verdure.

— Muhammad ibn Jubayr (d. 1217), *Travels*

Why is Harran so unusually hot? The characters discover that the growing heat in the town is the work of remnants of the Sabian magi, who hope that by making the city inhospitable they may drive away the population, leaving it an empty site that they may excavate for ancient treasures of their tradition and in which they may resurrect their cult. This desire to reclaim the site may find sympathetic ears among the characters, since Hermetic magi often have mixed feelings about similar mundane encroachment on magical sites. The magi may be tempted to aid the Sabians in their efforts, or they may seek to arrange some sort of compromise that allows them to practice their magic while leaving the local populace undisturbed.

#### **The Holy Mandylion**

The Image of Edessa (as the Holy Mandylion is called by the West) is now in possession of Otto de la Roche, the crusader Duke of Athens, not only one of the most powerful mundanes in the Theban Tribunal, but now virtually invincible thanks to this powerful relic. For his persecution of the orthodox clergy, the pope has recently excommunicated de la Roche (see *The Sundered Eagle*, Chapter 5: Athens, and 9: Relics of Constantinople). The characters are somehow motivated to return the relic to Edessa; perhaps they are hired by an Armenian nobleman (or magus), or else it is necessary to defeat a great evil that threatens Edessa.

#### **The Missing Talisman**

The characters are approached by representatives of the villages around the Sanjah Bridge. The talisman has been stolen, and the bridge is starting to crumble at a supernaturally fast rate. The local villagers depend on the bridge to allow them to transport crops to market. Can the characters track down the thief? Even if they do, can they restore the talisman's magical effect before the bridge collapses completely?

arch over 200 paces long, made from huge blocks of dressed stone. This was constructed in ancient times by a sorcerer working for a local ruler, who was aided by a talisman that he carried. The talisman is now implanted in an arch at the crown of the bridge. No one knows exactly what its function is, nor what would happen if it were to be removed.


## *Playing an Arzanjani Brass-Smith*

Arzanjani brass-smithshave a magical talent that allows them to manipulate brass by hand, enabling them to produce exceptional pieces of work. This is represented by the Minor Supernatural Virtue Lesser Power (*Realms of Power: Magic*, page 45), which is gained through guild Initiation. The Initiation Script to gain this power always includes the Minor Personality Flaw Vow (guild loyalty). Mechanics for Initiation can be found in *The Mysteries Revised Edition*, pages 8–16. Organization Lore: Arzanjani Brass-Smiths' Guild may be used in place of (Mystery Cult) Lore in this instance.

#### **Crafter of Brass**

1 Fatigue level, Init equal to (Qik – 6), Terram

R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind

A piece of brass touched by the user of this power becomes supple to the touch, so that it can be reshaped into a different form. This does not enable the smith to fuse pieces together, so she must still carefully cut out the basic shapes of the objects to be made. However, it does enable an imaginative smith to create pieces of great intricacy and beauty.

ReTe 15 (base 4, +1 Touch, +1 Conc, +1 for intricacy): Lesser Power (15 levels, –2 Might cost)

A character may begin the game with this Virtue, in which case she should also take the Vow Flaw and a score of 1 in Organization Lore: Arzanjani Brasscrafters' Guild. She should also consider taking Flaws that represent the experiences of her Initiation.

## **Story Seed: To Learn the Craft**

A magus of House Verditius is intrigued to learn about the powers of Arzanjani brass-smiths and sends the characters to find out more. He particularly encourages one of the characters (perhaps a filius) to learn the Mystery, so that they may later examine its similarities to aspects of Verditius Magic. However, in order to achieve this the characters will have to persuade the elders of the Arzanjani BrassSmiths' Guild to initiate one of them, including convincing them that their secret will not be shared with the world at large.

## *Arzanjan*

The bustling market town of Arzanjan is mostly populated by Armenian Christians. It is famous for the quality of the various pieces of work produced by its crafters, with pride of place going to its brass-smiths, who produce works of remarkable beauty in shapes unattainable by the brass-smiths of other towns.

# *Azarbayjan*

Azarbayjan is a mountainous province to the north of the Jazira. Both it and the province of Arran to the north are nominally ruled by a dynasty known as the Atabegs (A-ta-begz) of Azarbayjan, the current head of which is Muzaffar al-Din Uzbek (r. 1210–1225), who rules from Tabriz. Uzbek's rule lies lightly on his domain; much of it is left in the hands of local governors, and Uzbek himself both acknowledges the overlordship of the Khwarizm-Shah and pays tribute to the king of Georgia.

The population of Azarbayjan is incredibly diverse. Ethnically, it includes Turkic peoples, Persians, and people from the Caucasus, while its religious tapestry includes a broad mix of Muslims, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and followers of other religions. As a result of its terrain, communities are very scattered and its major centers are little more than large towns. The *lingua franca* of the region is a Turkic language, though most of the people also speak local dialects.

## *Lake Urmiya*

Taking its name from the town on its western shore, Lake Urmiya is a startling shade of blue and smooth as glass. At its center is a small island inhabited by fishermen, who catch the strange dog-headed fish that inhabit the lake. In ancient times this island was home to a powerful sorcerer who conducted experiments on these fish, but an explosion triggered by a failed experiment destroyed most of the tower, including its master, though catacombs remain beneath the ruins. The residue of the sorcerer's magical activities and the natural beauty of the setting have left the lake with a Magic aura of 2, rising to 3 on the island.

## *Maragha*

The city of Maragha seems to enjoy the favor of some supernatural entity, for it is surrounded by flourishing orchards that produce a strange type of melon, green-skinned with red flesh, that tastes like honey. In addition, the sky is always clear here, so the city is favored by astronomers who enjoy the opportunity to study the heavens without having to rely on good weather.

# *Gilan*

The province of Gilan is a relative backwater in the Muslim world, not being particularly rich or famous. Most of it is mountainous and covered with jungle, but the coastal plain is fertile, and the people who live here grow various crops including rice and wheat. The local rulers of Gilan pay tribute to the rulers of Jibal, to the south, but are otherwise broadly left alone to rule the province independently. The emir of Gilan has been forced into a political alliance with the leader of the Nizari Isma'ili (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia).



Barvan is the major city of Gilan and is notable only for its bad reputation, being said to have no good houses or markets. It also does not possess a major congregational mosque, although a number of minor mosques do exist. The Dominion aura in the city is unusually low, with a score of only 1.

# *Mukan*

Most of the province of Mukan consists of a swampy plain stretching from the mountains in the northwest portion of the province to the Caspian Sea. Much of this area is cultivated, with rice and wheat being particular crops grown here.

## *Bajarvan*

One of the chief cities of Mukan is Bajarvan, which while a modest settlement enjoys its fame through proximity to the source of the Water of Life, which is said to be near the town. However, no one has yet managed to find the fountain, or if they have, they have not returned to tell the tale.

# *Arran*

As noted earlier, the province of Arran is ruled by the Atabegs of Azarbayjan, though their actual involvement here is minimal. The majority of the population follows Armenian Christianity, but there is also a significant Sunni Muslim community here, including most members of the ruling classes.

## *Baylaqan*

The most important city in Arran is Baylaqan, which stands in a river valley supplied by several streams, with the result that the town has many mills, as well as

**The Sorcerer's Tower**

The secluded tower at Lake Urmiya could be a good site for a new covenant. Alternatively, it also provides a great excuse for an old-fashioned dungeon crawl, should the players feel nostalgic for the early days of roleplaying. In both cases, given that the sorcerer clearly bred the hybrid dog-fish found in the lake, it is more than likely that the tower and the tunnels below it house all sorts of hybrid monstrosities that may oppose or welcome the characters, depending on the needs of your saga.

#### **Dim Skies and Rotten Fruit**

An unheard-of thing happens: the skies above Maragha become cloudy. At the same time, the melon crop fails suddenly, going rancid overnight. The player characters are asked to investigate, and they soon discover that the town has fallen out of favor with the supernatural entity that up until now ensured its prosperity. The question is, what act by the populace has earned the creature's enmity, and how may it be appeased?

#### **To Build a Mosque**

Some of the people of Barvan would like to see a major mosque built in the city, both to provide a gathering point for the people and to improve the town's reputation, but the governor is not of particularly pious inclination and would rather spend his money on worldly pleasures. In addition, the most logical way to build such a mosque would be through the expansion of one of the existing mosques, but the townsfolk cannot agree on which mosque to expand. The characters are prevailed upon to act as external mediators both with the governor and between the leaders in the various mosques. Can they come up with a solution that will please everyone?

## *Khidr and the Water of Life*

Khidr (the Green One) is an important Muslim prophet. He is said to be immortal, having drunk or dived into the Water of Life, which he found by means of a shining jewel brought from Paradise by the prophet Adam. According to some stories, he and Alexander the Great sought the Water of Life together, crossing a dark land to find it. Alexander, however, became lost, so that only Khidr actually reached the goal of their quest.

Khidr wanders the world giving advice wherever God directs him; indeed, he is believed to have given guidance to all the prophets who have lived since his birth, with the exception of Muhammad, who instead tutored Khidr. Khidr has power over the sky, the sea and all plant life, and is a particularly important figure to the Sufis, who see him as the epitome of the Sufi shaykh*.* Khidr usually appears as a venerable Muslim in a woolen cloak. As a result of diving into the Water of Life, his skin and clothes are a bluishgreen color.

Khidr is best used as a mysterious adviser to the player characters. He is unlikely to reveal his true identity to them, and at times he will give advice that seems bizarre and unreasonable, although it will always be proved correct in the end (see Moses and Khidr, later). Should the characters wish to find the Water of Life — which purportedly grants immortality to those who bathe in it — they need to seek his guidance, though he will only help them in this if their intentions are pure.



The seer of Baylaqan is indeed correct, for in 1220 the Mongols descend on Baylaqan and destroy it. According to sources, since they are unable to find suitable rocks nearby for their mangonels, the Mongols cut down plane trees, saw their trunks into chunks, and use these as ammunition when they attack the city walls. They then pillage the city and burn it to the ground. Depending on when your saga is set, characters may arrive here either just in time to help fight the Mongols or after the conquest, in which case they may be asked to help rebuild.

flourishing gardens and orchards. However, this idyllic setting has recently become the site of discord, as the citizens are divided about how to treat a popular preacher who raves about a "storm gathering in the east" that will soon engulf its people. Some wish to lock him up or even have him executed, while others hail him as a seer.

been ruled by a Persianized Arab dynasty known as the Shirvanshahs (shir-VEHN-SHAHZ), who rule from their capital at Shamakhi. Currently power is shared between two members of the royal family: Farrukhzad I ibn Manuchihr III (r. after 1187–before 1225) and his son Garshasp I (r. 1204–1225). The majority of the inhabitants of Shirvan are either Sunni Muslims, like their rulers, or Christians.

# *Shirvan*

To the north of Arran and Mukan lies the province of Shirvan, a mountainous region with a number of towns dotting the valleys. For centuries the province has

## *Shamakhi*

The royal capital of Shamakhi consists of a town built entirely of stone, situated at the foot of a mountain and surrounded by gardens. Like Bajarvan, Shamakhi claims to be near to the source of the Water of Life, so it may be that explorers should start their search at the junction of the Cyrus and Araxes rivers. Shamakhi also possesses the Rock of Moses, which marks the spot where Moses met Khidr. A fish placed upon this rock by Moses and his servant came to life and swam away, and local people still come to the spot to pray for the healing of those languishing near death. For Muslims the rock is a relic with a Faith score of 3 and the Saint Power *The Faithful Made Whole*; see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 43–46 and 88.

# *Georgia*

The Christian kingdom of Georgia is, strictly speaking, outside the Muslim world, but its independence from Muslim rule is recent and hard won. Invaded by the Muslims in the 7th century, then embroiled in centuries of warfare with Muslim overlords, Georgia finally won independence in 1121 when King Dawid II (r. 1073–1125) took the capital of Tiflis, which remains the

## *Moses and Khidr*

Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our presence.

Moses said unto him: May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught?

He said: Lo! thou canst not bear with me.

How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge?

Moses said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught gainsay thee.

He said: Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself make mention of it unto thee.

 *— The Qur'an* 18: 65-70

According to the *Qur'an*, when Moses and his servant met al-Khidr, Moses asked if he could follow the prophet and learn from him. Khidr initially suggested that Moses would not be able to accept his actions without protesting, and eventually only allowed Moses to follow him when he agreed not to do so.

Khidr then led Moses to a boat, which he scuttled. Moses protested, but Khidr reminded him of their agreement and Moses agreed to keep silent. The same thing happened when Khidr slew a young boy, and again when he built a wall near a city where some people had refused to give them food. After Moses' third protest, Khidr explained his actions: The boat belonged to people who depended on it for their livelihood, but there was a coming a king who was taking possession of the boats of his people, so by rendering the boat unusable Khidr saved it from being taken. The boy, unlike his parents, was not a believer in Islam, so Khidr slew him so that they might get a better child (according to tradition, they gave birth to a daughter who was the progenitor of many prophets). The wall hid treasure that belonged to two orphans in the city, so by building it up Khidr was protecting it until they should be old enough to claim it. Moses and Khidr then parted ways.

The story of Moses and Khidr is a lesson in unquestioning obedience that might prove a useful model for Mystery Cult Initiations your saga. Magi might be required to follow a Mystagogue, keeping silent in the face of apparently bizarre acts. Sufis take the story as a model for the relationship of a Sufi student with his master.


capital of the state today. The current king is Giorgi IV Lasha (r. 1213-1223).

Georgia is a country of mountains, hills and plateaux, with lowland areas only on the coast of the Black Sea and the valleys of the rivers Rioni and Kura. It is inhabited by a number of different peoples, including Turks, Persians, Georgians, Armenians and Alans. There are both Christians and Muslims among its population, although the dominant faith is its own national Christian church, which owes loyalty neither to the Pope in Rome nor the Byzantine Emperor.

## *Tiflis*

Located on major trade routes, including the Silk Road, and itself a major trade center, Tiflis is a city of great importance in the region. As a result it has been hotly contested over the centuries, and this is reflected in its fortifications, which include double walls and three heavily reinforced gates. Despite this history of hostility between groups, Tiflis' population is remarkably ethnically and religiously diverse and tolerant, and mosques, churches and synagogues exist at times literally next to each other in the city.

# *Greater Armenia*

To the east of Asia Minor, and to the southwest of Georgia, lies the war-torn state of Greater Armenia. It is a land of

# *Story Seed: Sorcery, Treason, and Plot*

The characters prevent a magical murder attempt made on the King of Georgia, and they are charged to bring the perpetrator to justice. It is clear that magic was involved in the attempt (perhaps a character saved the king from a bolt of magical lightning), which makes the need to find the person behind it all the more urgent. If a Hermetic magus was responsible, then he is guilty of breaking the Code's prohibition on mundane interference, although a tribunal must determine whether he has brought ruin on his sodales and thus liable for censure. On the other hand, if it was not a Hermetic magus, then it was clearly someone with power that might be a threat to the Order of Hermes, in which case the investigation is all the more necessary.

## *A Greater Armenian Covenant*

Greater Armenia offers an attractive location for an Hermetic covenant, with its numerous isolated sites that have resisted mundane encroachment and may preserve high-level Magical auras. In addition, the chaotic politics of the region makes it easy to establish an independent presence, provided that the characters do not become so powerful as to pose a threat to neighboring political leaders.

On the other hand, setting up a covenant in the area is not without its challenges. The severe climate makes a covenant difficult to supply and support. In addition, as the current tribunals reach their limits in terms of how many Hermetic magi they can support, other magi may also be looking to set up covenants in the region and may challenge characters for the best sites.

mountains, high plains and valley basins. Its climate is very severe, with winters often lasting for over eight months. The country was conquered by the Muslims in the seventh century but managed to become an independent, tributary state in the mid-ninth century. However, soon it was torn by wars between the Muslims and the Byzantines, and in the tenth Century many Armenians migrated to Lesser (Cilician) Armenia in Asia Minor. Greater Armenia fell to the Turks in the 11th century and remains a contested area, for the Ayyubids have annexed some of its southern territories; the Byzantine Comneni retain part of it under the control of their empire at Trebizond, to the northwest; and the rest lies in the hands of local dynasties.

The population of Greater Armenia is mixed, consisting mainly of Greek and Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims. They grow cereal crops, fish in the rivers, and mine various metals and minerals, including silver and salt. The area is also known for its weaving, dyeing, and embroidery.

# *Mythic Persia*

Persia stretches from the Tigris River in the west to the Oxus River in the north and east. It is ethnically and culturally diverse; a consequence of both its vast size and its central position. However, over seven-tenths of its land area is desert and waste. Much of the country is high plateau, four to five thousand feet above sea level. Exceptions include the lands around the Persian Gulf south of the Zagros mountains, which are just above sea level, and the narrow coastal strip to the south of the Caspian Sea, which is just below sea level. The plateau is bounded by the Alborz mountains to the north and the Zagros mountains to the south and west. The plateau lacks major rivers since they find no outlet; many rivers on the plateau are simply lost in sands and swamps, rather than reaching the sea.

Persians are linguistically and ethnically different from the Arabs to the west. The majority of the population is found outside the great cities. Most are tenants, sharing their crops with their landlords, who tend to live in the towns. The low rainfall for most of the region results in a reliance on irrigation, through the use of underground water channels called *qanats*, which require constant and skilled maintenance. A significant minority of the population is nomadic or semi-nomadic; principally the Lurs of the Zagros mountains and the Ghuzz of Khurasan. Most of the provinces are ruled by a dynasty of Seljuk Turks who have sworn loyalty to the current shah; these rulers are either *atabegs* or *mamluks*. The atabegs were originally provincial governors who were tutors of Seljuk princes, but by the 13th century are semi-autonomous princes in their own right. The mamluks are raised as slave-soldiers to be utterly loyal to their masters, and placed in territories as direct subordinates of the sultan.


## *The Shahnameh*

The "Epic of Kings" is the national saga of the Persian people, composed by Ferdowsi in the tenth century. It is a record of the pre-Muslim history and legends of Persia. It begins with the creation of the world and of man, and then the introduction of fire, metal-working, agriculture, and other technologies. The early kings and their accomplishments are followed by the deeds of the great heroes: Saum, his son Zal, and grandson Rostam. The age of heroes ends with the conquest of Alexander the Great; Ferdowsi then gives the history of the Sasanids, and ends with the conquest by the Arabs (whom he calls "the Army of Darkness").

*The Cradle & The Crescent*

The *Shahnameh* is written in Parsi, and copies are often beautifully illustrated and decorated with gold leaf, and run to seven volumes in length. A good quality copy such as this is a summa on Persian Lore, Level 4, Quality 12. It can also be studied as a series of tractatus on Magic Lore, Faerie Lore, Divine Lore, and Infernal Lore, each Quality 10.

The language of Persia is Parsi, or Persian, a tongue unrelated to other Middle Eastern languages. Arabic is the language of Islam, and retains its pre-eminence when discussing religion; it used also to be the language of all scholarship, but in the 13th century most Persian secular books are written in Parsi. Turkish became well-established during the period of Seljuk dominance, and various dialects are found among the Ghuzz and the Lurs.

*Recent History*

The Seljuk Turks ruled Persia for nearly two centuries. It was always an empire made of two halves, with a sultan appointed in Khurasan to rule the east, while the Seljuk overlord ruled from the west. The sultanate of Khurasan came to an abrupt end in 1149 when the Shansabani family destroyed Seljuk rule there using infernal powers. To add to the troubles in Persia, the Ghuzz — who had been invited to settle in Persia and join the armies — rebelled in Khurasan in 1151, and invaded the neighboring provinces. Despite holding Sultan Ahmed Sanjar captive for over three years, the Ghuzz rebellion was short-lived, but the Seljuks never reclaimed Khurasan from the Shansabanis.

Ala ad-Din Tekish, the Mamluk ruler of Khwarazm, expanded his territory following the gradual collapse of the Seljuk empire after the death of Sultan Ahmed Sanjar, and eventually defeated his successor Togril III in 1194. Tekish's son Ala ad-Din Mohammed continued his father's work to conquer the remaining parts of the Seljuk empire, and proclaimed himself its shah in 1205, although the Caliph has yet to recognize this title. Since then he has crushed the Shansabanis in Khurasan, and extended his reign to Transoxiana, and is now the ruler of a vast empire that stretches from the River Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf. Two years ago the shah met with emissaries from Genghis Khan in Samarkand. The shah had them killed and shaved — a grave insult — and sent back to the Khan. It remains to be seen what the Great Khan's response will be.

# *Persian Supernatural Factions*

In addition to the Suhhar Sulayman — who are ubiquitous in Persia's cities there are five key supernatural factions who are active throughout Mythic Persia.

## *The Yatus*

In ancient times, the kings of Persia received assistance from sorcerers who went by the name of yatus. Unlike the mobeds who served Persia in a sacred fashion, the yatus were wholly secular, and had practices that were deplored by the Mazdean priests. Several of the ancient Persian kings used cadres of these sorcerers attached to their armies; the initial successes of Darius and Xerxes against

## *Peri Faeries*

The peris are the courtly faeries of Persia. Peris are almost exclusively female, and are extraordinarily beautiful — a pretty maiden in Persia is occasionally referred to as "peri-faced." Their game statistics are the same as for lesser nymphs (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 73), and they fulfill the same

role as entrapping lovers. However, peris rarely have powers over plant life. Peris are occasionally accompanied by diminutive male assistants who cater to their every whim; these are effectively sprites (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 85) except that they have brightly-colored birds' wings.

## *Pairika Demons*

A pairika is the Persian term for the Aerial Powers (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 42). These demons are treated as corrupt jinn by sahirs (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). They are cncountered throughout Persia and most commonly embody the crushing heat of the desert or the dreadful power of the earthquake.

#### **Powers:**

*Donning the Corporeal Veil*, 0 points, Init +9, Animal: Allows the nasu to take material form, which it can dismiss at any time. Nasu usually only leave the material world when there are no more corpses on which to feed. Cr(Re)An 25 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +1 requisite) Greater Power (25 levels, –3 Might cost, +2 Init)

*Corpse-Feeding*, 3 points, Init +8, Animal: When a nasu enters an orifice on a corpse, it can emerge three rounds later as ten individuals. Each of these individuals is identical in every way to the original nasu, including having this power, except that each swarm, no matter how large, has a single pawn of vis. Every three rounds, a nasu swarm can gain three points of size, and its ability to grow is limited only by the number of corpses it has available; of course, as it grows, it attacks living things and creates more bodies. CrAn(Vi) 25 (base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Group, +1 requisite) Ritual Power (25 levels, –2 Might cost, +3 Init, including Improved Powers) *Swarm Form* 0 points, Init 0, Animal: A

nasu does not attack as an individual, but rather as a swarm. The combat statistics are for an entire swarm, which must be the same Size or larger than its opponent. Thus a swarm of 100,000 nasus (Size +3) can attack a standard group of humans. A nasu swarm cannot be killed by normal weapons, only by area effects such as fire or smoke. The storyguide should consider how much of the swarm is affected by the area effect and assign damage in terms of Might points: if one-fifth of the swarm is affected then it loses one Might point; if twofifths is affected it loses two Might points, and so forth. Greater Power — no Hermetic equivalent.

**Vis:** 1 pawn of Animal, in body.

**Appearance:** A three-inch-long fly, with a red and yellow striped abdomen. They make a fearful buzzing sound when they fly.

The nasu is a Persian magical nonjinni spirit which is attracted to the bodies of the recently dead, especially the corpses of magical creatures or sorcerers. They rarely take material form unless summoned; they are minor spirits, and any apprentice summoner can call one, which is why many masters are very careful to indicate why they should never be summoned — one nasu can become millions in a matter of minutes if sufficient fresh meat is around. Although a magical spirit, nasu are not jinn and cannot be called by sahirs using Solomonic Sihr, although they can be summoned by wizards using (Spirit) Summoning.

the Greek city states can be attributed to the lack of preparedness among the Greeks for such magical assaults.

In the main, yatus of old were faerie wizards; legends hold them as the inventors of the Ars Fabulosa (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 131), which encompasses Faerie Summoning and related practices. Oral history recounts that these Arts were adapted directly from Canaanite Necromancy, which is held to be the origin of all summoning powers. Some yatus followed darker Arts and it was these Goetic yatus who prompted the persecutions by the mobeds that eventually lead to the decline of Persian magical warfare. When the Suhhar Sulayman was formed, Persia contributed several lineages of yatus who had survived the Mazdean purges and the Muslim invasions, and they brought with them the knowledge of True Names and the Invocation of Names of Power Virtue (see Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman).

The yatus today can be found in western Persia, Iraq, and the Northwest provinces. Most are members of the Suhhar Sulayman, combining Faerie Summoning with the Solomonic Arts, principally Solomonic Storytelling. Non-Solomonic yatus are faerie wizards specializing in the Ars Fabulosa. Faerie blood is quite common among the yatus. They are often pagan, which causes them to clash with many sahirs, so they tend to found closed communities of solely yatu buyut al-hikma.

## *The Mobeds*

The glory days of Zoroastrianism are long gone, but the faith is by no means extinct. Enclaves of mobeds can be found in Yazd, Daylam, and Kirman. For more information on the mobeds, see Chapter 5: Mythic Zoroastrianism.

## *The Nizari Isma'ilis*

The original assassins, Nizari Isma'ilis are a fanatical sect who use murder to further their religious and political agenda. They are a renegade faction of sahirs, and are detailed in Nizari Isma'ili State, later.



Zahhak was a demonic ruler of Persia in its heroic age, holding the nation in his evil thrall. He ruled from Ctesiphon in the days of Jamshid (see Istakhr, later), and conquered Persia after sawing Jamshid in two. Under his reign, virtue was despised and wickedness lauded. His thousand-year reign was eventually ended by the hero Feridun. Since that time, a Zahhak has periodically appeared and been battled by Persian sahirs, but he has never achieved the same level of power that he did in Jamshid's day.

Zahhak is not a demon in the tradi-

## *Story Seed: The Zahhak*

The last Zahhak was the Shansabani Sultan Mohammed al-Ghuri, defeated 14 years ago (see Ghur, later). It would be unusual for another to be formed so quickly, but some Persian sahirs believe that Genghis Khan is, or is advised by, a Zahhak. The predatory way in which he is turned towards Persia is typical behavior of possession by Azi Dahak. If, in your saga, Zahhak is behind the Mongol invasion, then a whole campaign could revolve around ridding the Horde of the demonic influence.

The first Zahhak was not killed by Feridun; rather, he was chained and buried under Mount Damavand (see Mazandaran, later) with the assistance of an angel. He is no longer possessed by the demon, but dwells there still, protected from death by the divine bindings about him. This ancient individual from Persia's heroic age might be able to give an insight to characters facing a reborn Zahhak.

## *The Demon Azi Dahak*

**Order:** Duke of the Spirits of Deceit **Infernal Might:** 40 (Mentem)

**Characteristics:** Int +2, Per +2, Pre 0, Com +1, Str +12, Sta +4, Dex +5, Qik –1

**Arts: Ablating** 12, **Binding** 8, **Command-**

**ing** 8, **Summoning** 10

**Powers:**

*Coagulation*, 4 points, Init –1, Animal: Azi Dahak can form a physical body, and dismiss it at will.

*Obsession*, 1–3 points, Init –5, Vim: Azi Dahak can invoke the Personality Trait of Power Hungry. See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 31, for more details.

*Envisioning*, 1 point, Init 0, Mentem: The demon can appear in the dreams of a person.

*Possession*, variable points, Init +2, Mentem: Azi Dahak usually places all of his Might Pool into possession and can control the actions of his victim. He cannot regenerate Might points until the possession ends, so he has to leave periodically. During this time, his victim suffers terrible dreams of his death and torment in hell, and may act to prevent the demon returning. See *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 32, for more details.

*Trust of the Innocent*, 1 point, Init –1, Mentem: The target of this effect loses all judgment and believes a specific lie (as long as it is passable) until presented with evidence to the contrary. An Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 6 is allowed to resist the effect.

*Forked Tongue of the Serpent*, 3 points, Init –1, Mentem: The target believes any lie, no matter how preposterous, until he relates that lie to someone else. At this point he realizes how ridiculous the falsehood sounds, and the demonic power is broken. An Intelligence roll against an Ease Factor of 9 also reveals the lie to be false, with the first roll allowed an hour after the effect was used, and further rolls permitted once every subsequent hour.

*The Serpent's Oracle*, 2 points, Init –3, Vim: The demon can duplicate the effects of any Intellego spell for the cost of 2 Might points. It may also gain a morsel of future knowledge, understanding the most immediate consequences of any one specific action.

*Empower the Possessed*, 0 points, Init 0, Vim: Whenever a possessed victim is willfully using the Goetic Arts, Azi Dahak grants a bonus equal to his own score in that Art. Furthermore, the demon's Hierarchy score can be used in place of the possessed character's score.

**Weakness:** Abhorrent Material (flame from a Mazdean temple)

**Vis:** 8 pawns of Mentem vis prava, in eyes.

**Appearance:** On the rare occasions it takes material form, Azi Dahak is an immense winged serpent with three heads, bearing six eyes and three pairs of fangs on each head. When wounded, snakes and scorpions spew from its wounds.



tional sense. Rather, when Azi Dahak the demon possesses an individual, that person becomes Zahhak. Possession is indicated by the growth of a black snake from each of the victim's shoulders. When cut off they simply regrow; only removal of

the possession can cure them. The snakes crave human brains, and the victim is driven to satisfy this need by the demon inside him.

In the first instance, the possessing demon forces the new Zahhak to do evil deeds, but over time the victim is corrupted by the whispers and promises of power of the demon, and so far none have resisted his lure. Once the victim embraces evil, he is taught the Goetic Arts (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 114), and can use Ablating to extend his life, gain magic resistance, and call upon all manner of evil powers by stealing them from other demons and supernatural creatures.

## *The Ghuzz*

The Ghuzz are a race of magicblooded humans who originate from the steppes to the north of Persia and east of the Caspian Sea. Legend tells that they are the scions of the biblical giants Gog and Magog, and there is no denying the giant blood that runs strong in these fearsome tribesmen. In addition to their size and their warrior reputations, the Ghuzz are also infamous for their uncontrollable nature. They would be all the more terrible if they could remain organized or loyal enough for long enough to make an effective force. The Ghuzz can be found in many of the southern provinces of Persia, particularly Kirman, Makran, and Seistan. Ghuzz breed and ride huge horses; those of the magic kin are the size of elephants.

## *Ghuzz Characters*

All Ghuzz tribesmen have the Large Virtue, except for those in whom the blood of Gog and Magog runs strong. These, typically the leaders of the Ghuzz, are magic kin, and they have the Giant Blood Virtue, and a Greater Immunity to mental manipulation. These Ghuzz cannot be swayed through mundane or magical means, and thus cannot be controlled through Leadership, Charm, or Folk Ken, through Virtues such as Inspirational, or even through the *Command the Masses* Greater Power Virtue common among the Ghuzz leaders. The Ghuzz — magical kin or otherwise — often

have the Rebellious Personality Flaw.

#### **New Virtue: Greater Power (Command The Masses)**

Major, Supernatural

This new Virtue grants the Command the Masses power that is described later. The Greater Power Virtue is further described in *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 44.

*Command the Masses*, no cost, Init Qik – 2, Mentem: The Ghuzz can issue an order, and a standard Group of men are strongly inclined to obey this order. In battle, this secures total leadership, and the Ghuzz need not spend his turn forming a trained group or changing their actions. ReMe 30 (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Diam, +2 Group) Greater Power (30 levels, –3 Might/Fatigue cost, +1 Init)

#### **New Flaw: Rebellious**

Major or Minor, Personality

The character reacts adversely to any attempt to impose authority over him, and actively works against those who are in command. He does not necessarily have any desire to be a leader himself, but he does not easily submit to another's leadership.



This province was the birthplace of two of the greatest Persian dynasties, the Achaemenians (6th–4th centuries BC) and Sassanian (3rd–7th centuries AD). It thus gave its name to the whole region, for the original name Parsa became Hellenized to Persis. Fars is currently an atabegate ruled from Shiraz by the Salghurid dynasty.

Climatically, the province is divided into two parts: the Hot Lands (*Garmsir*), the lowlands near the coast; and the Cold Lands (*Sardsir*) to the north, in the highlands. In its southwest corner is the desert of Mandistan.

## *Arranjan*

The westernmost of Fars' five great cities, Arranjan lies on the south bank of the Tab River, which forms the border with Khuzistan. It is surrounded by date gardens and olive groves, and is known for both soap and bitumen. There have long been Isma'ili strongholds on the many hilltops around Arranjan, and the city itself has recently been captured by the Isma'ilis.

## *Darabgerd*

The circular city of Darabgerd was founded by a family of Daylamite origin, and has always held Isma'ili sympathies even if this has not been openly declared. Near Darabgerd is the Kubbat-al-Mumiya, the "Bitumen Dome," which is locked by an iron door and opened once a year when an officer of the sultan arrives and gathers in a box the twelve months' accumulation of bitumen for royal use.

## *Kajaran*

This is a small but prosperous town near the Persian Gulf. Endemic to the region is a type of magical worm that grants skill and luck to those that possess it. The

## *Story Seed: The Well of Hindijan*

Hindijan is the port of Arranjan on the lower reaches of the Tab River. Many fruitless nights have been spent by treasure hunters in Hindijan, searching for a cache of treasure rumored to be hidden there. A certain well has drawn much interest from the treasure hunters; it emits poisonous vapors, such that any bird flying over it fall dead into the well. However, because of its poison, the well remains as yet unexplored.

## *Salt of Seven Colors*

Near to Darabgerd is a hill where rock salt of seven colors is occasionally dug out. This salt is of interest to sahirs for it is Dedicated Vis (*Realms of Power: Magic*, page 122), exceptionally suited to the summoning of jinn, who find it particularly pleasing. Each pawn of this vis gives the same bonus as two pawns of normal vis when summoning jinn (but not other types of spirit). Princes like to keep control of the salt mines and use the salt of seven colors to court sahirs, or reward them.

#### **Story Seed: Summoner's Salts**

A sahir is gifted with a princely sum of salt of seven colors, either as an inducement or a reward for a trivial task. This allows him to summon and bargain with much more powerful jinn than he ever could before, and his benefactor hints that he can get much more. Unfortunately, the salt provided to the sahir is tainted to be highly addictive, and the jinni summoned keeps demanding more and more. This is fine while the benefactor keeps supplying the salt, but he eventually starts to ask for bigger and bigger favors. The sahir comes to the characters (or perhaps is one of the characters) in need of solutions: how to escape from the powerful jinni he has summoned, and how to uncover the nefarious plot of his "benefactor."

## *The Kajarani Worms*

The worms are an unusual Beast of Virtue, in that they can be Enriched (*Realms of Power: Magic*, page 124) while they are still alive. A worm must be kept on its own in a box for a season, and not be exposed to any light during this period. Every day the worm must be fed twelve mulberry leaves, each one precisely folded into a pellet. At the end of the season, the worm grants the Luck Virtue to the person who fed it. If it was fed by more than one person, it dies. A Kajarani worm eats any other worms it comes across. After a year, the Enrichment process must be repeated, or else the worm dies. If repeated, the worm grows bigger — to the size of a mouse — and grants Puissant (Abil-

ity) Virtue to its owner in addition to Luck. To prevent the worm from dying it can be Enriched in the third and fourth years; the worm grows to the size of a cat and a dog respectively, and grants the Venus' Blessing Virtue in the third year and the Wealthy Virtue in the fourth.

All Virtues are cumulative, but if the worm dies, they are lost. However, in the third year the possessor of a worm cannot refuse to pander to the worm's comfort (the Compulsion Flaw); and in the fourth year it begins to repulse him, eventually developing into the Fear Flaw. No one in Kajaran permits their worms to live for a fifth year, in fear of becoming another Haftvad.


growing rice and pomegranates.

On the hills to the northwest of the city are the *Sih Gundaban*, the "Three Domes," three great fortresses, behind which has been built a great dam in a deep gorge. The dam provides sufficient water for a thousand men during a year long siege. There is also a training ground on a flat hilltop.

Between Shiraz and Istakhr is the Forest of Kamfiruz, an oak forest surrounded by pasture land, and the town of Bayda. The forest is home to fierce lions, which are the terror of the cattle on its pasture.

*Kish*

of the Persian Gulf. A great walled city dominates Kish, which lies about 12 miles from the coast. Famous in its own right for the pearls fished here, Kish throngs with trade from Arabia, Africa, and Al-Sindh; products are transported to Huzu on the mainland and taken north to Shiraz. Kish has risen in prominence over the last hundred years or

The island of Kish is the principal port

so, since the previous port of Siraf further west around the coast was destroyed by an earthquake that lasted seven days.

#### **Abarkavan**

The Long Island is home to pirates and raiders, and is the bane of the emir of Kish who prefers that the traders coming to his port are unmolested. Kish's lucrative pearl fishery banks are also close to Abarkavan, and divers risk encounters with the pirates whenever they collect their harvest. The pirates have among their number an elementalist (*Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, Chapter 2) who plays havoc with the wind and waves.

## *Mount Kavarvand*

This mountain is home to Adur Farnbag, one of the three Royal Fires of Zoroastrianism (for the others, see Mihr and Takht-i-Suleiman, later). The Royal Fires were believed to have been ignited before creation, and brought forth on the

## *Istakhr*

the mountains.

The governance of the north district of Fars is administered from Istakhr, which was known to the Greeks as Persepolis. Around and inside the city are several buildings that date to the time of Jamshid and King Solomon. The shores of nearby Lake Bakhtigan are crowded with villages

fortune it grants is proportional to its size, but the Kajarani are careful not to allow the worm to grow too big. In the past, Haftvad allowed his worm to grow for seven years, into a glossy black dragon with a splendid saffron-colored pattern on it. Once a simple peasant, Haftvad used his good luck to became a tyrant who controlled all the land from Basra to Kirman. His armies defeated King Ardeshir (founder of the Sasanid dynasty), and it was not until Ardeshir killed the elephant-sized dragon with boiling lead that Haftvad's luck ran out and he was slain. Haftvad's mighty fortress still exists, hidden high in

## *King Jamshid*

The fourth king to rule the world, according to the *Shahnameh*, Jamshid made his capital at Istakhr, which then was called Takht-e Jamshed. He was a mighty sorcerer who had control over all the jinn of the world, and invented armor and weapons, weaving and dyeing, masonry, making wine, and navigation and ship-building. He was endowed with the royal *farr*, a shining light that indicated the blessing of Ahura Mazda. However, he grew to boast of his accomplishments, and the farr abandoned him. Without the farr, Zahhak (see later) was able to make war on him, and Jamshid was brutally murdered by the demonic tyrant.

#### **The Jaam-e Jam**

The Cup of Jamshid is a silver cup ringed seven times with gold and gems. For it to work, it must be filled with an elixir of immortality. This can be any liquid that grants long life, such as al-Iksir (see Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman) or a Hermetic Longevity Ritual in an appropriate form. This liquid must be invented afresh each time it is made, and brewed specifically for the user of the cup; this permits use of the device for one season. Once used in the cup, the elixir loses its magical properties. When activated, the cup allows the bearer to see any place in the world, similar to *Summoning the Distant Image*, but without the need for an Arcane Connection to the place scried. The user needs to merely mention the name of the place to be viewed, and an image appears in the cup. The Jaam-e Jam can also give visions of the heavens, which doubles the wielder's Artes Liberales for astrological calculations, and doubles Solomonic Astrology for magical workings.

The Cup of Jamshid was used by the ancient Persian dynasties right up to the Muslim invasion. It was never taken by the Arab rulers and remained hidden in Istakhr until rediscovered by a sahir several years ago.

#### **Story Seed: The Spying Sahir**

The sahir in possession of the Cup of Jamshid has been using it for petty purposes — spying on his neighbors and rivals, which may include the characters. In the midst of his nosy scrying, he stumbles upon a noted member of the community doing something unconscionable, such as binding a sentient being, sacrificing to the devil, or something similar. There is no way he can reveal what he has seen without revealing how, and so he must manipulate the characters through his secret knowledge of them, making them uncover the nefarious deeds of the eminent citizen.


## *The Imamzadihs of Shiraz*

The shrine of the brother of the fourth imam and the shrine to the daughter of the sixth imam have a long and bitter rivalry. The former is found on the Street of Butchers, and is known for baraka to cure injuries to the limbs. The latter has a much more prominent position just off the main square, and grants baraka to cure all problems with the feet. When a powerful emir is inflicted with a painful abscess on his foot, devotees of each shrine clamor for his attention, knowing the prestige (and riches) they will earn from his healing. Characters who have been healed at one of the shrines might be asked to provide testimony, and get caught up in the riots when the other shrine tries to disrupt the proceedings. The emir might ask the characters to determine which of the two shrines is the most worthy — or the most likely — to cure his complaint.

back of the ox Srishok to propagate faith and protect mankind. Adur Farnbag is to be found within a terrestrial Divine regio (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 13) with an aura of 8. The entrance to the regio opens on the west side of the mountain every dawn and the east side of the mountain every dusk; the pure holy fire pours forth from the regio entrance, earning Kavarvand the epithet of "the shining mountain."

Adur Farnbag is housed within a Zoroastrian fire temple. It is accounted the most holy of the three Royal Fires because it is seen as the earthly representation of the yazata Atar, who burns in the presence of Ahura Mazda. It was originally located in Khwarazm, but later brought here by mobeds who still dwell on Kavarvand, thanks to the Gifts of Gayomart (see Chapter 5: Mythic Zoroastrianism). Adur Farnbag represents the priests of Ahura Mazda, and anyone who is an ervad or higher initiate receives a bonus to all Ability and magic rolls equal to their Theology: Mazdean Ability while within the regio. Mount Kavarvand is a place of pilgrimage for Zoroastrians. Any temple fire which is lit from a flame deriving from Adur Farnbag has its Divine aura increased by an additional +1.

## *Shiraz*

Shiraz was made the capital of the Persian empire by the Buyid dynasty (945–1055), who decorated it with palaces, with mosques, and with the great wall that surrounds it. Today, Shiraz is famed as a place of learning, home to several academies and schools of famous poets, and it has been granted the epithet of *Dar al-Elm*, the House of Knowledge. Its central position in Fars makes it a thoroughfare for most of the province's business and trade. It is packed with narrow, crowded markets, and boasts three great mosques.

Perhaps the most famous structures of Shiraz are its many shrines to the *imamzadihs* — the relatives or descendents of the twelve Shi'i imams. Each imamzadih can grant a different miraculous power (mostly regarding healing specific ailments, finding a spouse, or easing childbirth), and the shrines vie for the attention of pilgrims and visitors.

## *Shapur*

The City of Flowers, as it is sometimes known, Shapur's exports are irises, violets, jasmine, narcissuses, and, most notably, the red rose of Shapur. Ten different kinds of perfumed oil are made in Shapur, made from the various flowers of the city. Of these, attar of roses is perhaps the most famous; this expensive perfume makes it all the way to the courts of England and France.

## *Yazd*

The mountainous region around Yazd became the stronghold of Zoroastrianism after the coming of Islam to Persia, and remains one of the few regions where the Mazdean faith is still practiced openly. The mountains around Yazd contain six holy shrines, or *pirs*, which form the destinations for yearly communal pilgrimages for the Zoroastrian villages, and an excuse for feasting and dancing.

The city of Yazd is well-fortified, and has two iron gates on the Istakhr road. The city is very fertile, thanks to the streams that flow from the nearby mountains, and it seems like paradise to have such a fertile land so close to the Great Deserts. The mobeds are held responsible for this minor miracle.

## *The Black Man*

In a cave near Shapur is a 40-foottall statue of a man carved in black stone. At the base of the statue are three carved leaves. Some say that the statue is carved to represent King Shapur; others believe it to have been a real man turned to stone by God. The kings of Persia's ancient dynasties used to anoint the statue in oils, but none have given it homage for many centuries. The cave behind the statue has a waterfall, and a wind always seems to be blowing from its mouth.

The statue is actually a mighty *div* (demon), bound into this statue by a mobed many centuries ago. It is believed to be one of the 45 named demons (Chapter 5: Mythic Zoroastrianism), but which one is unknown. Knowing he was not powerful enough to bind the demon in perpetuity, he fashioned the three leaves — originally colored green — as a warning of when to repeat the binding; as it eroded the color would fade from the leaves. In the days of the Zoroastrians, the anointment of the statue was accompanied by a blessing by the mobeds to renew the binding. Since the days of Muslim rule this practice was abolished as idolatry, and the demon is close to being free. Only one tenth of one of the leaves remains green.



## *Persian Rugs*

A famed export from all over Persia is the intricately woven carpet or rug, and the center of excellence in Persia is Isfahan. A traditional Isfahan rug has an ivory-colored field bearing a single central medallion surrounded by leaves and vines. Vibrant hues of blue, rose, and indigo are employed using dyeing techniques that are a closely guarded secret of the Isfahani weavers.

There are several weavers of magical carpets in Isfahan; these craftsmen mostly have the Touched by Magic Major Virtue (*City & Guild*, page 72). This Virtue allows a weaver to make a magical carpet by adding the magnitude of the magical effect and the Uses per Day modifier to the basic Craft Total of 12. Each weaver can only instill magical effects which cover two Hermetic Forms. A magical carpet only ever operates for the person for whom it was made.

The two most famous weavers are Dadvand and Yarankush. Dadvand is a manufacturer of the famed flying carpet. Dadvand's family have been making these carpets since the time of the Sasanids, and they have patrons among the Suhhar Sulayman. These are exceptionally expensive due to the skill required to make them. Dadvand makes other magical rugs as well, such as ones that promote an aura of health which speeds recovery from wounds.

Yarankush is known for making carpets which protect their owner. He specializes in rugs that let out a loud noise when they are stepped on by anyone other than their owner, and in these days of secret murder such carpets are a boon to any powerful man. Unknown to all, Yarankush is a member of the Isma'ili assassin sect (see later), and in the design of the carpet he hides a secret warning so that they know not to step on it. Since advertising that one has a Yarankush rug defeats the point of having one, this has not affected Yarankush's sales.

#### **Dadvand's Steed of the Air**

Twice per day, this heavy woolen carpet can lift off the ground and transport its owner, and everything he is carrying, through the air as fast as a horse can run. ReAn 15 (Base 1, +1 Conc, +2 very unnatural motion, +1 carry person on carpet, +1 speed; +5 maintains concentration). Ease Factor to make: 16

#### **Yarankush's Murderers' Chagrin**

Twice per day, the owner can activate the warning function of this carpet. As long as he remains in contact with the carpet (sleeping or sitting on it, for example), any other individual touching the carpet causes it to emit a loud sound for a round; each carpet produces a different noise. CrIm 3 (Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Size). Ease Factor to make: 14

# *Jibal*

Named "the mountains" (*al-jibal*) by the Arabs, this province is dominated by the Zagros mountains which run northwest to southeast along its southern quarter. Its four great cities (Hamadan, Isfahan, Kirmanshah, and Qazvin) have all at one time been home to one or more of Persia's dynasties or conquerors, and their fortunes have waxed and waned; but at all times the largest city Isfahan has flourished. South of Hamadan is the emirate of Luristan, the home of the Lurs, a semi-nomadic people who herd goats in the foothills of the Zagros mountains.

The chief road through Jibal — called the Khurasan Road — passes from Baghdad to Kirmanshah, then Hamadan, and Rayy before heading into Qumis through the Caspian Gates. Jibal is one of the most densely populated of Persia's provinces, and has a correspondingly high number of sahirs. It is common to see a sahir carried aloft on a jinni-made whirlwind, or riding one of Isfahan's famous flying carpets, speeding to some important engagement.

## *Isfahan*

Arising in the Zagros Mountains to the west of Isfahan, the Zayandah River passes through the city and flows into the swamp of Gav-Khanah on the borders of the Dashti Kavir. Here the river sinks underground and emerges 90 leagues away in Kirman, where it eventually reaches the sea.

This, the biggest of Jibal's cities, lies on the northern bank of the Zayandah River. It is actually a twinned city: to the east is Jay, surrounded by a wall with a hundred towers, and to the west is Al-Yahudiyah, the "town of the Jews," who have dwelt here since the time of Nebuchadnezzar. The noted physician Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in the West) lived and taught here. Isfahan exports silk and cotton, as well as saffron and all kinds of fruit, but it is for its carpets — the famed Persian rug — that Isfahan is best known.

## *Kargas Kuh and Siyah Kuh*

The "Vulture Hills" and "Black Hills" are the highest points on the plain of Persia: black, evil-looking mountains, and famous hiding-places for robbers. Between the two mountain ranges is the caravanserai of Dayr al-Jiss, where, by order of the Sultan, four great tanks are kept full of water to supply travelers crossing the Dasht-i Kavir.

## *Kirmanshah*

This is the seat of the semi-independent province of Kurdistan, which was created in about 1150 by Sultan San-


jar for his nephew. Kirmanshah boasts a great mosque and a sumptuous palace. About a day's march east of Kirmanshah are the sculptures of Bustam, carved into the black rock of the mountainside. These depict King Darius receiving tribute from his subject kings, and the much later sculptures of King Khursaw Parviz and Queen Shirin, whose story is well known — Shirin was loved by the sculptor Farhad, who killed himself in despair for his love of her.

#### **Kanguvar**

Kanguvar, called Kasr-al Lusus, the Robber's Castle, by the Arabs, lies near to the road heading east from Kirmanshah; it is so named because of the larcenous activities of its inhabitants. Travelers are well-advised to count their fingers and toes after passing through Kanguvar.

## *Qum*

Perhaps the second most holy place to Islam in Persia after Mashhad, Qum bears a shrine to the Fatima, sister of Imam Reza (see Mashhad, later). Buried with her are the three daughters of the ninth imam. Reza once told the faithful that a pilgrimage to his sister's tomb would assure entrance to Paradise.

A few miles east of Qum is the mosque of Jam Karan. In 986 Hassan ibn Muthih was visited by the Imam of the Ages and the prophet al-Khidr, and told to build a mosque on the sacred ground of Jam Karan. The mosque built at his direction is virtually unequaled in Persia in terms of architecture and embellishment. The mosque has a Dominion aura of 7.

## *Rayy*

The city of Rayy is strongly fortified, and has five gates over the five roads that radiate from here — to Hamadan, Qazvin, Mazandaran, Khurasan, and Qum. The inner city, containing the mosque and the houses of the bureaucrats, is surrounded by a ditch. The outer city surrounds and overlooks the inner city, and has a prominent fruit market selling melons, peaches, apricots, and so forth. It also exports bluedyed cotton, particularly as striped cloth, and hardwood taken from the Mazandaran forests.

On a nearby mountain there is a shrine dedicated to Shahr Banu, a Sasanid princess and mother of the fourth Shi'i imam. Legend has it that the princess was swallowed by the mountain rather than allowing her enemies to kill her. For centuries before there had been a shrine here dedicated to Anahita, the Mazdean yazata of water and fertility. The spring at the shrine is a source of Aquam vis, if the water is collected when Venus is in the sky.

## *Savah*

The people of Savah are camel-drivers and herders, but the great mosque of Savah contains a magical library unequaled in Persia. Attached to the town's mosque is a hospital and a tall domed tower, which houses the library on its lower floors and an observatory at its top. The tower is staffed by Savah's House of Wisdom, all of whom are members of the Ashab al-Najm (see Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman). The observatory of Savah is world-renowned, containing innumerable star maps ranging from ancient Babylonia to the current day, and the state-of-the-art in astronomical instruments. In addition to having a Magic aura of 5, the observatory grants a +3 bonus to any astrology rolls, including use of Solomonic Astrology.

The current Asala of the Ashab al-Najm hails from Savah, a wizened old man named Meriq al-Asala al-Qalani al-Safar al-Najm. He is mostly known for wearing a strange hat that looks like it is inside-out, and joking that his hat does not sit on his head, but rather that his head sits on his hat. After the previous Asala left in 1186 (see Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia, Nasibin), Meriq stepped forward to represent the family, to general acceptance by the


other astrologer-viziers at the Majlis, who consulted the heavens. Many of them now think he does not take the responsibility seriously enough, but do not feel they should ask him to step down. He does not have The Gift, but is nonetheless a gifted communicator and has written many excellent books on Artes Liberales and Solomonic Astrology, among other subjects.

## *Takht-i-Suleiman*

The "Throne of Solomon" is located in a semi-circular valley in the mountains of Jibal. At the summit of a small, flat-topped hill is a small but deep lake fed by an underwater spring. On its shores is a remarkably well-preserved Mazdean fire temple, whose walls are co-terminal with a terrestrial Divine regio of aura 8. The regio is the resting place of Adur Gushnasp, one of the three Royal Fires of Zoroastrian belief (see Mount Kavarvand earlier for more details of the Royal Fires). Adur Gushnasp is particularly attuned to warriors and nobles, and a weapon made in a forge lit from Adur Gushnap and quenched in the waters of the lake receives a +4 bonus to invoking God's aid in battle (*Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 41) whenever the warrior for whom it was made uses that weapon. This bonus lasts for a number of years equal to the wielder's Theology: Mazdean Ability. The weapon loses all power permanently if used by another.

# *Khuzistan*

Khuzistan is the most ancient inhabited area in Persia, once known as Elam in the days of old Babylon. Khuzistan occupies the watershed of the great Karun River, which starts in the Zagros mountains, and Khuzistan's well-watered plains are used to grow sugar cane. Its many rivers have been canalized to serve the fields and the towns, and all are navigable by boat. The northern reaches of the province are home to the semi-nomadic Lurs (who also occupy southern Jibal). Khuzistan is ruled by a Ghuzz atabeg of the Hazarasp family who has sworn loyalty to the Khwarazm-shah.

## *Ahwaz*

The capital of the province of Khuzistan, Ahwaz is plagued by jinn who cause it to be unbearably hot during the day, and swarming with biting flies at night. The crashing of the waterbound jinn over Ahwaz's weir keeps those not used to it up at night, and the fields around the city are plagued with all manner of snakes and scorpions.

## *Gundeshapur*

The city of Gundeshapur is home to the great medical school and hospital known as the House of Healing. It was founded by the sahir Bakhtyshu, a Nestorian Christian and one of members of the wise council of Harun that reformed the Suhhar Sulayman. His descendents still run the school, which was funded by the Seljuk Sultans and has remained in high regard with the Khwarazm-shah. Unsurprisingly, the House of Healing is also Gundeshapur's largest bayt al-hikma. It is a palatial building near the center of town, with doors open to every direction and covered porches of canvas held up by wooden columns on all four sides. It has many windows depicting the stories of the members of the First Council, though many locals mistakenly believe them to depict Christian legends, and a great hall surrounded by an outer corridor (much like a cloister). The whole house is inside a Divine aura, which the sahirs must work around by digging out laboratories deep beneath the ground where there are many buried pockets of Magic power, and these rooms are connected with the common area by long, narrow ladders.

The vizier currently representing the bayt at Gundeshapur is Nil al-Wazir al-Salih al-Yad, a sahir of Christian descent who converted to Islam after joining the Suhhar. Many believe that he maintains a dangerously close association with the sahir sect called the Nizaris (see The Nizari Isma'ili State, later), members of which have occasionally visited him at the famous House of Healing. The Ashab al-Yad have always had a poor reputation in the Suhhar, however, and Nil has never seemed particularly troubled by these accusations at Majlis. He is said to be a great historian, very knowledgeable about past events of the Middle East, and also wellversed in European history. He is not especially skilled at Solomonic Medicine, as others of his family might expect him to be, but instead seems to prefer the art of Solomonic Storytelling, and is said to have an enchanting singing voice.

## *Ramhurmuz*

A rich town that makes its living from silk and perfume, Ramhurmuz also boasts a modest library. The sahirs of Ramhurmuz in the past made contact with one of the fabled sorcerers of Soqotra (see *Rival Magic*). For several years the exotic wizard studied with them and they exchanged ideas; but in his naivety he gave away many of the secrets of his island, including the recipes for many perfumes which the sahirs made into a commercial success. When he realized that he had been duped, the sorcerer left, but not before laying a fearful curse on the district, which every year is inundated with gnats and biting midges.

## *The Alchemist of Ahwaz*

There is an alchemist who claims to be able to turn base metals into gold who lives in Ahwaz. He needs a few magical ingredients to effect this change, and promises to share his yield with characters if they help him get the supplies he needs. Key among these ingredients is the wood collected by the gryphons that live in the Zagros mountains for their nests. However, he intends to abandon his helpers to the mercy of the gryphons, so as to safeguard his secret recipe.


#### **District of the Zutt**

The Zutt are a tribe that dwells to the southeast of Ramhurmuz, close to the border with Fars. They are a seminomadic people who claim to originate from beyond Al-Sind, and they travel in wagons richly painted with vibrant designs. The Zutt themselves favor flamboyant colors in their dress, utilizing delicate silks and heavily-dyed linen. The Zutt have a reputation for larceny, and the Khuzistani are usually hostile to them when they arrive in town to trade. Zutt women are known for being powerful Folk Witches (*Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, Chapter 3).

Occasionally the Zutt wander further afield, and have been encountered Egypt and in Samarkand. Furthermore, some of the covenfolk of Atsingani (see *The Lion and the Lily*, page 76) bear a close resemblance to the Zutt.

# *Kirman*

Kirman, although technically part of Persia, has a history of remaining virtually independent. The Ghuzz had ruled the region since invading across the desert fifty years ago, but their authority has disintegrated under their notorious inability to be ruled themselves, and the Ghuzz have entered into the ranks of the Khwarazm-shah's army, which now occupies Kirman.

Kirman is mostly steppe and semi-desert, and is famous for its oranges, dates, and pistachios. It is the home to several secretive communities of Mazdeans, who try to not draw attention to themselves, for they have been heavily persecuted in the past. A quarter of the province is taken up by the Jabal Kufs, mountains found to the south of the Dasht-i Lut.

## *Bardasir*

The city of Bardasir is an important trading center, set between the west of Persia and Khurasan. Outside the town

## *The Balu Tribesmen*

The Jabal Kufs are occupied by Balu tribesmen who are greatly feared by the Persians. Travelers' tales recount that they use rocks to stone their victims to death in order not to needlessly blunt their swords. They are rumored to need neither food nor drink, and to have the tireless nature of their war-camels. The Balu detest the Ghuzz, but consider them worthy enemies to use their swords upon.

The Balu have a strong dose of Jinni Blood (Chapter 3: The Jinn), and very often have the Greater Immunity to Thirst Virtue. They are usually accompanied by their jinn kinsmen on their raids, and they have wise men who possess Faerie Summoning and Bonding (see *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 131–133). Their war leaders are occasionally bonded to desert or mountain jinni, allowing them access to their faerie powers.

## *Story Seed: The Lion-Shah*

When the lion-shah hears that the lions of Kamfiruz in Fars (see Istakhr, earlier) are being persecuted by the local emir, he asks the characters to protect them, and if possible, bring them to Jiruft so that they may be safe. In return, he offers his gratitude and that of the lions; this could prove a valuable commodity to a sahir or to an animal trainer.

on a very tall hill is the provincial governor's palace, set amid lush gardens. The city is guarded by a second fortress at the gate, and a third castle overlooks the houses from the center of the city. Despite all this military might, Bardasir was still sacked during the Ghuzz invasion, and it has been overtaken by Sirjan in importance.

## *Jiruft*

This city lies on the Div Rud — the "Demon River" — that thunders with such force that waterwheels throughout the city supply power to the processing of indigo, cotton, and grain. The forests around Jiruft are home to lions, and the city is under siege from the fierce creatures. Anyone approaching the city must brave the deepshadowed forests, and trade with the outside has dried to a trickle in recent years. The lions of Jiruft are ruled by a jinni, who took over the pride about a decade ago. Since he extended his glamour over the forest of Jiruft it has acquired a Faerie aura, and the lions have become mildly Warped in the process.

# *Mazandaran*

This is the collective name given to the provinces between the Caspian Sea and the Alborz mountains. Gilan is the easternmost province (see Chapter 7: Mythic Mesopotamia), with Daylam to its south, then Tabaristan further west (whose chief city is Amul), then Gurgan in the far west (whose capital is also called Gurgan). During the Muslim conquest of Persia, Mazandaran was never taken, partly due to its protection by the Alborz mountains to the south and partly due to the strong resistance put forth by its aristocratic Mazdean families. The Bavand family remained in control of Mazandaran for 200 years, before they were eventually brought down by the Nizari Isma'ilis (see later) in 1125, who are now dominant in the region.

Mazandaran was known to the ancient world as Hyrcania, a land famous for its tigers (see insert). The region is exceptionally fertile with a tropical climate, and the Zoroastrians believe that it was especially blessed by Ahura Mazda. Unlike most of Persia, houses in Mazandaran are usually built of wood rather than brick, and it is



## *Hyrcanian Vis*

Vis is plentiful in the lush and fertile lands of Mazandaran. The yatus attribute this to Mount Damavand, believing it to be the source of all vis in the world, whereas the Daylami mobeds consider it part of Ahura Mazda's bounty.

Vis commonly accumulates in the unique or unusual in Mazandaran: for example, if a chicken lays three brown eggs and one white, the white one contains vis. In a field of wheat, it is the ear that has thirteen grains that has the vis. The furthest piece of driftwood on the Caspian shore might also contain vis.

Characters can spend time searching for vis by following up on rumors gleaned from locals, and the hunter can expect to follow blind alleys or find that the vis has already gone. Searching for vis takes a base time of one season, and the character must travel through an area the size of a small county. Make a Perception + Area Lore: Mazandaran roll against an Ease Factor of 9. Success indicates a pawn of vis. For every point in excess of the Ease Factor, either another pawn of vis is found, or the time taken is halved. These can be combined in the case of a good roll; for example, a character who makes the roll by 8 may take 11 days (halving four times) to find five pawns of vis. Renewable sources of vis cannot be found using this method; those should result from stories instead.

**Search for Vis: Per + Mazandaran Lore + Modifiers + simple die against an Ease Factor of 9**

\* Only one of these bonuses can be used \*\* Cannot grant a bonus greater than the character's Mazandaran Lore. Further, if Magic Lore is not used, half of the vis found (rounded up) is tainted by the Realm applicable to

the Lore used.

The storyguide can adjust the Ease Factor according to the density of local magicians or magical creatures. For example, if another sahir has searched in the region in the previous year, then the –3 penalty from the table is appropriate, even if the character has not searched here recently. At the storyguide's option, this mechanic can be used to find vis in other regions (with the appropriate Area Lore), although the yield is typically lower. The Ease Factor would be 12 for a typical wilderness region, 15 in a settled area, and 18 in a city.

Most sahirs living in the region whether of yatu or Nizari training — discover or are granted a Personal Vis Source (as per the Virtue) early in their career.

particularly famed for an exotic hardwood called *khalanj*.

Mazandaran is a magical battleground between three factions of magicians. First, in the southwest is Daylam, which is one of the few strongholds of Zoroastrianism remaining in Persia. Second are the Nizari Isma'ilis, who have strongholds in the Alborz mountains and dominate the political scene in Mazandaran. Finally, there are the yatus of Mount Damavand. The members of these three groups clash regularly. All three groups have deep religious convictions that they will never agree upon, and Isma'ilism in particular is a proselytizing faith which seeks to unite all men under its banner, and remove those who refuse to convert. Furthermore, the yatus and the Nizaris fight over vis sources, the mobeds and Nizari fight to influence or control the local rulers, and the mobeds detest the yatus for their paganism and presumed diabolism.

## *Daylam*

This highland region resides in Gilan and Mazandaran, but may as well be a country in its own right. At the height of its power in the tenth century, Daylam encompassed all of Gilan, Tabaristan, Gurgan, and Qumis; now all of these provinces are under separate rule, and Daylam is identified culturally rather than geographically or politically. The Alborz mountains isolate Daylam from the Persian plateau, and it is inhabited by a fiercely independent people who resisted the rule of the Sasanids and the Arabs. The Daylami were one of the last peoples in Persia to accept Islam, and Zoroastrianism is still relatively strong here, existing uncomfortably alongside Isma'ili Islam. The Nizari Isma'ilis hold fifty castles in Daylam, of which the chief is Alamut (see later), the strongest is Maimun-Diz, and the most remote is Lamasar.

## *Qumis*

The province of Qumis lies at the eastern Alborz mountains south of Tabaristan. Its chief settlement is the city of Damghan, which is virtually the only non-Isma'ili settlement in the province. The emir of Qumis is under siege in his own land, and he treads very carefully so as to not upset his subjects, never knowing which of them is a Nizari. Isma'ili efforts in Qumis


are coordinated from the great mountain stronghold of Girdkuh. Girdkuh charges a toll on all travelers through Qumis, since it is on the only route between western Persia and Khurasan that does not cross the Great Desert.

## *The Great Wall of Gurgan*

This immense fortification stretches from the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea eastwards and north to end in the Pishkamar Mountains. The wall is over 120 miles in length, with 35 forts placed approximately every 30 miles. The wall is 25 feet wide, about 20 feet tall, and has a central canal carrying water throughout its entire length. It is made of red bricks, reinforced by steel and adamantine — an unbreakable metal

## *The Caspian Gates*

Through the province of Qumis runs the road from Rayy to Nishapur. This road passes through the Caspian Gates, or Sirdara to the Persians. The "gates" are an interminable narrow gorge cutting through the mountains; carts can only advance in single file between the vertical cliff faces, and progress is hindered further by the water pouring down the rocks and the swarms of serpents that haunt the area. Merchants still risk the road in preference to taking the route across the Great Desert.

made from diamonds by certain magicians. There is a Magic aura of 5 along the length of the wall. Legend holds that the wall was built on the order of Alexander the Great (and thus is sometimes called *Sadd-i-Iksandar*, the dam of Alexander) to keep the descendents of Gog and Magog from entering Persia. In this purpose it seems to have failed, for the Ghuzz (see earlier) entered Persia a century ago, and were invited to stay.

One of the reasons it might have failed to repel the Ghuzz is a breach in the wall, at the closest fort to the Gates of Alexander, which mark the western terminus of the wall close to the Caspian shore. No one knows how recent the breach is, but since its discovery the local sahirs have noted the lack of the aura alignment (*Realms of Power: Magic*, page 16) that used to mark the Wall of Gurgan, in that spells

**Vis:** 2 pawns Animal, in feet.

**Appearance:** The Hyrcanian tiger is a long-legged tawny cat, about 7 feet long (including a 3 foot tail), and weighing about 150 pounds. Tigers in Mythic Europe have spots rather than stripes, although naturally you can have striped tigers in your saga if you prefer.

Hyrcanian Tigers are found in Mazandaran and Persia's northern desert. The tiger is named after its swift flight (coming from a word meaning "arrow"), and gives its name to the Tigris River. The ancient Persian kings loved keeping Hyrcanian tigers as pets, and even today the nobility set hunters to steal cubs to be trained for the hunt. The pursuing mother can be distracted by glass spheres; on seeing her own reflection she thinks it is her cub and is cheated from her revenge.

The tiger receives a +3 to all rolls involving running.

For a mundane version of this creature, remove the Might score, Magical Qualities, Powers, and vis from the earlier description. A Hyrcanian tiger is more than twice as swift than the fastest horse, even without magical powers, but can normally only sustain such speeds for one or two rounds. Its prey's only hope of escape is to dodge and weave, since the Hyrcanian tiger cannot make sharp turns when traveling at full speed. It is in the magical tiger's nature to hunt, and it consumes its prey — principally gazelles — even though, as a magic animal, it doesn't need this to survive.


## *Story Seed: Sealing the Breach*

The characters are aware of a threat to Persia's security, whether from the Mongols, from a Zahhak, or from an enemy yet to reveal itself. They learn the yatus of Damavand are the guardians of an initiation script that grants the Major Magical Focus of "Enemies of Persia," but it can only be performed in the aligned aura of the Wall of Gurgan. The characters must try to repair the breach in the wall, which might involve going head-to-head with whatever supernatural foe caused it.

directed against giants used to receive twice the normal aura bonus. It is obvious to anyone who inspects it that the breach was intentional, and there is evidence of non-Solomonic magic used to enforce the gap in the wall's protection. The sahirs of Mazandaran have showed little interest in repairing the breach since the Ghuzz are of no current threat to them.

The Simurgh is an immense bird that lives on Mount Damavand, although she makes expeditions to all corners of Persia and most of its inhabitants have seen her at some point. The people of Persia are oddly comforted by her presence, as she is a bringer of fertility as well as a symbol of national pride. The Simurgh is so old that she claims to have seen the destruction of the world three times over. During her exceptionally long life she has accumulated wisdom, and she is an authority on many subjects. In her most famous legend, the simurgh adopted the albino Zal (the father of Rostam), when he was abandoned by his father in the Alborz mountains. Zal learnt much from the Simurgh, and when he left her she gave him three of her feathers, with which he could summon her in need. The Simurgh is so large that nor-

## *Mount Damavand*

This distinctive mountain dominates the whole of Tabaristan, and its snowcapped summit is visible for hundreds of miles across the plains of Persia. Damavand is the home of the Simurgh, and the evil tyrant Zahhak is believed to be imprisoned below the mountain. There are seven settlements on the lower slopes of the mountain, each one with its own bayt al-hikma composed of mostly yatu-descended sahirs (see insert).

# *The Great Desert*

Although referred to as a single desert — the Great Desert, or Al-Mafazah ("The Wilderness") — Persia's central dry lands are composed of two distinct regions, called Dasht-i Kavir in the north and Dasht-i Lut in the south. The Great Desert belongs to no province; it is a no-

CrHe(An) 55 (Base 1, +3 Sight, +4 Year, +4 Bound, +2 Size, +1 Animal requisite) Ritual Power (55 levels, –9 Might cost, including 5 points from Improved Powers)

**Vis:** 15 pawns of Animal, in breast feathers **Appearance:** The Simurgh is an enormous creature, large enough to carry off an elephant. She appears as an eagle with the head of a dog and claws of a lion. Her feathers are the color of highly polished copper, although her peacock-like tail is patterned with thirty different colors.


The Simurgh is not designed to be a player character.


man's-land where outlaws find shelter and there are no permanent villages except for the three oases. The roads that join towns on opposite sides of the Great Desert have water tanks and domes built every three to four leagues, and it is in the best interests of merchants to keep these tanks full. Both deserts are the haunt of jinn.

## *Dasht-i Kavir*

This salt desert is found to the north of Persia's central plateau. It is about 500 miles west to east, and about 200 miles north to south. Although the center of the desert receives virtually no rainfall, there are marshes, wadis, and steppe-like regions within the Dasht-i Kavir, and in the west a great salt lake. Unlike the Dasht-i Lut (see later), the Dasht-i Kavir is home to many birds, such as the ubiquitous sand grouse and the impressively large bustard, as well as the fabled Persian gazelle and the Hyrcanian tigers who hunt it.

#### **Garmah**

In the center of the Dasht-i Kavir, halfway between Isfahan and Tabas, is one of the three oases of the Great Des-


ert. It consists of three hamlets camped around a small fort, some palm trees, and pasture where cattle can forage. The emir of the fort is charged with keeping the desert routes clear for merchants and other travelers.

#### **Naband**

The middle of the three oases of the Dasht-i Kavir, Naband sits between Kirman and Quhistan. Despite possessing a guard house, the domed water tanks of

\* Males only.

**Appearance:** A small, delicate ante-

lope with fawn hide; its flanks are marked with a dark stripe. The male has horns that it uses to defend itself.

The gazelle (Arabic *ghazal*), is called "dorcas" in the Western bestiaries. It has exceptionally sharp sight (+3 to visionrelated rolls) and is swift (+3 to running-related rolls). Only the male gazelle engages in combat; when forced to do so, he temporarily gains the Ferocity Virtue (grants 3 temporary Confidence Points). It is common in the Dasht-i Kavir of Persia.


## *The Rig-i Jinn*

An area of sand dunes in the central Dasht-i Kavir is home to a tribe of jinn. The Rig-i Jinn is avoided by the traders who cross the desert, but the jinn, while mischievous, are not malicious. The Rig-i Jinn is found within a Faerie Aura of 3, but it is an extension of the glamour of the tribe, and moves when they do. Travelers encountering the jinn spy a lush oasis where there should be none. They may encounter either hospitality or hostility depending on the mood of the jinn, but whether they are given food and drink or wounds, the oasis will have moved during the encounter, and when the faeries retreat, the characters could be tens of leagues away from where they started.

## *Why Go to Hell?*

It is difficult to imagine why characters would ever come to Gandom Beriyan. However, there are a few reasons why they might. It is a place of Infernal pilgrimage, and a group of characters might chase a villain here before he can dedicate himself more fully to the path of Hell. Characters might accidentally stumble upon it while fleeing from the Balu tribesman; if this occurs, they may find themselves being rescued by their pursuers, who are loathe to allow the land more victims than is necessary. Alternatively, as the hottest place on earth, the Gandom Beriyan might be important in a mystery initiation, or as a place to forge or destroy an item of power.

Naband are notorious hiding places for desert raiders.

## *Dasht-i Lut*

The "emptiness desert" is approximately 300 miles along its northwest-to-southeast axis and 200 miles wide. The eastern part of the Dasht-i Lut is a low plateau of salt flats. The southeast is principally sandy. Unlike the Dasht-i Kavir, animal and plant life is much more scarce in the southern desert.

#### **Gandom Beriyan**

The central portion of the Dasht-i Lut is called Gandom Beriyan ("the toasted wheat"). It is a volcanic wasteland covered in black lava. It is the most treacherous of terrains, riddled with ravines and sinkholes, and blasted by a terrifically strong wind. The Gandom Beriyan is the hottest place in Persia, and is completely devoid of animal or plant life.

The Gandom Beriyan is, however, the home of the most malicious and evil of the jinn tribes, since an Infernal aura of 4 covers this area. The aura is corrupted with a Debauched aura of exhaustion (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 14) that prevents anyone from spending Confidence points while here. At the heart of the Gandom Beriyan is the entrance to a Tartaran regio with an Aura of 7 where the air itself burns, and the rock is molten. One of the most powerful corrupt jinn in Persia lurks in this regio.

#### **Sanij**

The southernmost oasis of the Great Desert, Sanij links Kirman with Seistan. The Balu tribesmen (see Kirman, earlier) know this valley oasis well, and are a constant threat to the sizable population that lives here.

# *Makran*

This coastal province gets its name from *mahi khoran*, meaning "eaters of fish" in Parsi. It is sparsely populated, with most of the population concentrated in small fishing villages. The capital of the province is Fannazbur, but it is a poor town compared to the mighty cities of other provinces. The port of Tiz is a stopping point between Al-Sind in the east and Fars in the west. In the past, Makran was the battleground between the Arab caliphs and the kings of Al-Sind, and war elephants captured from the latter in battle were integrated into the Persian army. Bands of Ghuzz roam through Makran, having once been part of the invasion force that occupied Kirman.

## *The Gedrosian Desert*

O Commander of the faithful! It's a land where the plains are stony; Where water is scanty; Where the fruits are unsavory; Where men are known for treachery; Where plenty is unknown; Where virtue is held of little account; And where evil is dominant; A large army is small for there; And a small army is useless there; The land beyond it, is even worse…

> — Messenger to Caliph Umar, 644 AD

Famous for its impassibility, the desert of Makran has fought at least three great ancient armies in the past: that of Cyrus the Great, the legions of Queen Semiramis, and finally the previously unconquered veterans of Alexander the Great. Known as Gedrosia to the ancients, the arid coastal region is inhabited by scattered fisherfolk.

The region contains an incredibly large number of pagan ghosts, soldiers from the armies that have died since antiquity attempting to cross its arid expanse. As restless dead, these spirits are readily susceptible to the summons of necromancers and other summoners, although most are overwhelmed with the emotions of despair and memories of deprivation and are unable to provide much useful information about their past.



Seistan is a lowland country around and east of Lake Zarah, into which several major rivers drain. Like Quhistan and Ghur, Seistan is a dependency of Khurasan. In the *Shahnameh*, Seistan is called Zabulistan, famous as the home of Zal and his son Rostam, a man of both heroic proportions and heroic reputation. Seistan is home to many Ghuzz.

## *Dartal*

The city of Dartal is located in the Zamin-Dawar, the "Land of Gates," referring

## *The Idol of Zur*

At the time of the Muslim conquest, a fabulous idol was taken as booty from the Zur Mountain near Dartal. It was made of solid gold, and had rubies for eyes. For the last few hundred years it has been owned by a succession of notables, but is now in the possession of a Zutt family (see Khuzistan, earlier). Whether through its own power or that of the Zutt matriarch, the idol has the ability to move, and has been walking in the direction of Zur for the last few years. The characters encounter the Zutt family following the two-foot idol as it slowly makes its way to Zur. What will happen if it is permitted to return to its shrine is unknown, but could either be very good, or very, very bad.

to the passes into the mountains of Ghur. Dartal is heavily garrisoned with horse guards as protection against the warlike Ghurs on the other side of the mountains. Flocks in the Zamin-Dawar is the source of much of Persia's wool.

## *Rostam*

Rostam is the legendary hero of the Persian race. He was a giant so big his mother struggled to give birth, and his father had to be taught to perform a caesarian section by the Simurgh. His constant companion was Rakhsh, a stallion big enough to bear his weight, fierce enough to kill a lion, and twice as swift as any other horse. The best-known tales of Rostam are *Haft Khan-e Rostam* and *Rostam and Sohrab*. In *Haft Khan-e Rostam* (Rostam's Seven Quests), he journeys to rescue his king from the clutches of the demons of Mazandaran. The story ends with an epic battle between Rostam and the *Div-e Sepid* ("White Demon"). In *Rostam and Sohrab*, Rostam mistakenly kills his own son Sohrab in battle. Rostam was eventually killed through the treachery of the king he served.

The legend of Rostam can be integrated into a saga in a number of ways, and some ideas are given later. So famous is it that any Persian character is likely to know the story of Rostam without an appropriate Ability roll, but precise details should be left to those with an appropriate Area Lore.

#### **Mythic Blood: Rostam**

A magus who hails from the line of Rostam has great physical prowess. He can grant himself a +3 bonus to any one type of physical action that is a specialty of the Athletics, Ride, or Swim Abilities (e.g., climbing, running, riding at speed, diving, swimming long distances, etc.). Each time this power is used, a different physical action can be selected; the bonus lasts for two minutes, and the power cannot be used again until the previous bonus's duration has expired (ReCo 25: base 10, +1 Diam, +2 flexibility). The Minor Magical Focus that accompanies this bloodline is Damaging Supernatural Creatures, and the Personality Flaw is Reckless (born mostly from stubbornness rather than heroism). It is likely that the character has either the Large or the Giant Blood Virtue.

#### **Rostam's Tiger Skin and Mace**

Rostam's Tiger Skin was worn over his armor, and he used it as a blanket when adventuring. It grants a Soak bonus of +5 that is cumulative with any other armor, and it has a Load of 1. It makes its possessor a very deep sleeper; the character can always recover Long Term Fatigue levels from a night's sleep, even if it is on hard ground or unpleasantly cold. However, a Stamina roll against an Ease Factor of 9 is required to rouse the character from sleep at all, and when woken the character has a –1 penalty to all actions until the sun rises. These effects can be thrown off by spending a Confidence point. The tiger skin is currently in the possession of the emir of Ghur.

Rostam's Mace is a two-handed mace (treat as a warhammer, **ArM5,** page 176) of superlative craftsmanship, and grants +3 to both Attack and Defense Totals. While held, the mace grants the wielder the effects of the Inspirational Virtue. It was taken to Turan (Transoxiana) by Rostam's enemies after his death, and is currently in Samarkand, lying forgotten in one of the tombs in the Shahr-i-Zindah.

It is said that reuniting the mace and the tiger skin with the body of Rostam will rouse the hero from his deathlike sleep — albeit temporarily — and cause him to stride afresh to Persia's defense. Once the threat from the east becomes apparent (see Chapter 9: The Silk Road, Genghis Khan), Persian sahirs may well consider that the resurrection of their greatest hero is worth the trouble. A quest in the story of Rostam in Elysium (*Realms of Power: Faerie*, page 34) may grant clues to the location of the two items.


## *Zaranj*

The capital of Seistan is Zaranj, built on a branch of the great Helmund River; during flood time the city is perilously close to the shores of Lake Zarah as it swells dramatically in size. The city has an inner town surrounded by a wall, beyond which are the suburbs of the outer town. All the houses have running water thanks to above-ground channels, and they nearly all have cellars in which the inhabitants live in the oppressive heat of the summer. Within Zaranj is a fluted tower with no doors, stairs, or visible means of approach. On top of the tower are believed to be the bones of Rostam and his horse Rakhsh; their bodies were exposed to the sun and the vultures in the Zoroastrian manner, but their bones were never retrieved. Instead, the tower was sealed to serve as a monument.

Around the city are salt marshes; these are inundated when the level of the lake rises every year. Beyond the marshes are the desert sands. The Zaranj area is famous for its *baad sad va bist rooz*, the "120 day wind" which blows north to south from the beginning of summer until the autumn. As it blows, it whips up a cloud of dust that clothes the whole region in dirt. Some believe the wind to be the home of jinn, but in fact it is a host of migrating air elementals (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 138) who cavort through the area once a year.

# *Khurasan*

The largest province of Persia, Khurasan is named after *khor*, the sun, indicating that for many Persians, the sun rises over Khurasan. The region has long operated as an independent sultanate, but is now firmly part of the Empire of the Khwarazm-shah. Seistan, Quhistan, and Ghur are all districts of Khurasan rather than provinces in their own right.

## *Herat*

Known as the Pearl of Khurasan, Herat is dominated by the remains of a citadel built by Alexander the Great. Like many of the cities in this area, Herat has changed hands many times in the last century, but it has nevertheless managed to develop a reputation for brassworking, which remains its chief export.

Herat boasts a Zoroastrian fire temple called Sirishk just two leagues to the north atop a hill; unusually, this temple is still inhabited by a mobed and attracts worshipers from the nearby hills. The presence of Shamiran castle directly behind the temple may have contributed to its longevity. There is also a Nestorian church between Sirishk and Herat. To the south of the city is a lush land like a garden, profusely irrigated by numerous canals.

## *Karakum Desert*

This "black sand" desert, also called the Desert of the Ghuzz, lies between the Caspian Sea to the west and the Aral Sea to the north. It is bounded on its northeastern border by the Oxus River which flows into the Aral Sea in Khwarazm.

## *Merv*

An important oasis-city on the Silk Road, Merv has been named "the rendezvous of the great and the small" as a testament to its immense market, where, if accounts are true, it is possible to buy anything. Merv once claimed to be the largest city in the world, but in 1153 it was pillaged by the Ghuzz nomads, and since then has changed hands between the Khwarazmians, the Ghuzz, and the Ghurids, and has lost importance in Khurasan in favor of Nishapur. The last of the great Seljuks, Sultan Sanjar, is buried in Merv, under a great dome covered in blue tiles which is so high that it can be seen from a day's march away.

The libraries of Merv are greatly celebrated. The Great Mosque has two: the

## *Lake Zarah and Mount Khajeh*

According to Nestorian Christianity, the three magi started their trip to Bethlehem from Lake Zarah. According to Mazdean legend, the lake is the keeper of Zoroaster's seed; when the final renovation of the world is near three virgins will enter the lake and thence give birth to the saviors of mankind. The waters of the lake have a Divine aura of 2.

A flat-topped black hill called Mount Khajeh emerges from the waters of Lake Zarah. It bears an ancient fire temple and two abandoned forts collectively called Qal'a-e Sam — the "fort of Saum" — named after Rostam's grandfather.

## *Story Seed: The Riddles*

The Emir of Herat has made a strange announcement: "One must come to me, neither clothed nor naked, neither afoot nor on horse, and speak to me neither indoors nor out. If this person does not come, then Herat shall be destroyed!" The emir is under the control of a horrible ghoul, and the only way to free him is to answer its three riddles, and the emir reckons anyone clever enough to answer his own riddle is also smart enough to answer those of the ghoul. Unfortunately, the ghoul also has a powerful Death Prophecy: it can only be killed by someone who is neither man nor beast; by someone who does it neither by day or by night; someone who offers it a present that is not a gift; neither by metal, nor rope, nor poison, nor stone, nor fire, nor water; and by someone who is neither fasting nor eating at the time.



A disease that is particularly common in Khurasan thanks to the malign influence of Mars is *rishtah*, known as *dracunculus* ("little dragon") in Latin. Worms form in the flesh of the limbs of the victim, and their hot venom causes severe inflammation and paralysis of the infected limb. Most often the legs are affected (causing the Lame Flaw until cured), but rishtah occasionally afflicts the arms or eyes (simulated with the Missing Hand or Missing Eye Flaws, respectively). Rishtah is difficult to contract, but also difficult to eliminate without medical assistance. It is a Serious Choleric disease of Severity 12; with a Stable Ease Factor of 4 and a Recovery Ease Factor of 18. The interval time is one month (for more details of diseases, see *Art & Academe*, page 45).

A cure used by the Ghuzz is to bury the afflicted limb in hot sand from dawn until dusk. The worm then migrates from the limb and into the sand. The problem with this cure is that sometimes the rishtah survives in the sand and can grow to be five feet long (and some report even bigger ones). The Ghuzz call such a worm the *olghoi khorkhoi*, and report that it has been known to attack travelers and livestock with its fiery venom.

Found in the northern deserts of Persia and Transoxiana, the olghoi khorkhoi ("intestine worm") is the mature form of the worms that cause the disease called rishtah. It can move about freely beneath the soil, and, while blind, is very sensitive to vibrations. If it succeeds in a Dexterity + Stealth roll greater than its victim's Perception + Awareness roll, it can burst out of the ground next to him, gaining a +3 bonus to Attack on the first round of combat only. Initiative is rolled after this initial attack. Animals instinctively shy from the olghoi khorkhoi, and the reaction of horses is often the first sign that one is in the area.

'Aziziyah, with over 12,000 books; and the Kamaliyah library, with slightly fewer. Also stored here are the libraries of the colleges of Samanidiyah, 'Umaydiyah, and Khatuniya. The Dumayriyah library is perhaps one of the smallest, but many of its 200 books are unique, and all are priceless. Of most interest to the Suhhar Sulayman, the library of the grand vizier

Nizam al-Mulk is part of the greater collection of Merv, and its House of Wisdom is the keeper of these great tomes of magic.

Merv is home to a group of faeries who dwell in the market, running stalls next to the locals. These faeries help fulfill Merv's reputation as a place where anything can be purchased. They gain vitality from making exchanges with mortals, although they themselves do not supply any goods; they simply arrange a deal with a different mortal who can provide the desired goods. The result is an intricate web of favors and exchanges that might involve several tiers of mortal involvement.

If the characters need a particularly exotic ingredient or item, then Merv is a





good place to find it, but the price might be equally difficult to obtain. The answer is to visit a different faerie merchant to obtain *that* thing, hoping he will ask in return for something easier to get. The trick is knowing when to stop; you might end up needing to find a pebble with a white spot on it, but you are equally likely to be asked for the crown of the Sasanid king!

## *Mashhad*

The city of Mashhad is perhaps best known for its luxurious shrine to Imam Reza, the eighth Shi'i imam. Reza was unexpectedly appointed by the Sunni Caliph Mamun to be his successor to the Abbasid caliphate. Following violent uprisings from the Sunni Muslims after hearing this announcement, Reza suddenly died before he could take his post, leading the Shi'a to accuse Mamun of regretting his decision and solving the tense political situation with murder.

Mashhad ar-Rizawi ("the place of the martyrdom of Reza") was built on the site of his death, a tradition arose that a pilgrimage to Mashhad was worth 70,000 pilgrimages to Mecca, and the tomb of the imam became a holy place to which people flocked from all over Persia. The shrine has a Divine aura of 6.

## *Nishapur*

On a strategic site controlling access to the east, Nishapur is named after the first Sassanian King, Shapur I, who made it his capitol for a brief time. Like most of Khurasan's cities, Nishapur is dominated by its market. Its market streets have many hostels for the merchants, and almost every trade is represented here. Virtually all

## *Story Seed: Save the Books*

The invasion of the Ghuzz have taught the sahirs of Merv a lesson. An even bigger threat, in the shape of Genghis Khan, looms to the east, and Merv is home to thousands of books that can never be replaced. Unable to impress on the colleges and madrasas the importance of moving their books to a safer location, the sahirs are doing their best to copy as many as they can. This frantic attempt to preserve these irreplaceable texts can lead to any number of stories:

- • A forgotten secret is uncovered when a book is copied. *Example: the location of Solomon's Seal.*
- • Theft of books to which clerics deny access. *Example: A daring raid into the Dumayriyah to liberate a tome of Isma'ili theology.*
- • Transport of books to a safe place. *Example: Some of Nizam al-Mulk's most prominent tomes are moved further west, but a group of hostile magicians are aware of the opportunity to steal magical power for themselves.*

## *The Footsteps of Imam Reza*

All along the road between Nishapur and Mashhad are imprints on the rocky road which are locally believed to be the footprints of Imam Reza left as he made his fateful journey towards his death in Mashhad. It is said that a person who retraces every footstep and matches his own to them will be especially blessed in the next venture he undertakes. However, several of the footsteps are difficult to locate thanks to erosion and the actions of malicious jinn, who sometimes create false trails to lead petitioners astray. Completing the pilgrimage should involve a short story where the character's faith is tested, but if completed successfully, the character gains the Intuition Virtue for the duration of his next venture.

#### **Mihr**

This unprepossessing village on the road to Nishapur is the home to one of the three Royal Fires of Zoroastrianism (see Mount Kavarvand, earlier, for more information on the Royal Fires). The ruins of a fire temple hide the entrance to a terrestrial Divine regio of aura 8. Within, the fire temple is intact, and inside it burns Adur Burzen-Mihr, the holy flame. This fire is specifically tied to farmers and craftsmen, just as the other two fires are tied to royalty and the priesthood. A tool left in the regio for a year will be purified by the holy flame, and henceforth grant a +4 bonus to any Craft or Profession Ability rolls made using it. This bonus lasts for a number of years equal to the Theology: Mazdean Ability of its owner. Only the owner of the tool can benefit from this bonus; should another even touch the tool, it loses its purity forever.

## *Quhistan*

This "land of the mountains" is on the east of the Great Desert, bounded by Khurasan and Seistan. It is mostly a highland district with a corresponding cool climate, unlike the surrounding lands. While technically a dependency of Khurasan, Quhistan is part of the shadow Isma'ili state (see later), and they control the mountain fortresses of Turshiz, Qa'in, Birjand, Muminabad, Dara, Tabas and Nih.

# *Ghur*

The people of Ghur are more closely related to the Baluchi and the people of Bactria and Badakhshan than they are to Persians. When the Shansabani (see insert) were driven from Ghur by the Khwarazm-shah, they unfortunately left their familiar demons and evil spirits behind. As

## *'Umar Khayyam*

This famous astronomer, poet, and sahir lived and taught in Nishapur until his death in 1123. He was trained in the Solomonic Arts at Nishapur's House of Wisdom — a House he later went on to lead — and was an apprentice with both Hasan-i Sabbah and Nizam al-Mulk (see The Nizari Isma'ilis State, later). Nizam al-Mulk later provided him with a yearly pension to continue his studies. 'Umar Khayyam wrote several influential books on mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy, but he is best known for his poetry.

*Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra*; written in Arabic; Summa on Artes Liberales (Level 5, Quality 9) *Explanations of the Difficulties in the Postulates of Euclid*; written in Arabic; Tractatus on Artes Liberales (Quality 10)

*Map of the Stars*; written in Arabic; a Tractatus on Artes Liberales and a Tractatus on Solomonic Astrology (both Quality 11; includes a +1 from the beautiful illustrations of the original)

*Rubaiyat* (collection of poems); written in Parsi; Summa on Philosophiae (Level 4, Quality 9)

## *The Cypress of Kishmar*

In Kishmar near Turshiz, Zoroaster planted a cypress tree that had sprung from a branch he had brought from Paradise. It grew taller than any cypress ever had, a monument to the conversion of King Goshtasp to Zoroastrianism. It was uprooted in 861 by Caliph Mutawakkil and transported across Persia to be used for beams in his new palace, although the caliph was killed on the very day it reached its destination.

There are several cypresses in

Quhistan that people claim have grown from seeds of the Kishmar tree, and in some cases, this is even true. The trees themselves radiate a Divine aura of 1 within five paces, and this aura is automatically tempered with the Calm virtue (see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, pages 38–39). Wood from the fallen branches of these trees fed into the sacred fire of a Zoroastrian temple increases the Divine aura of the temple by 1 point until the wood has been burnt. Wood chopped from the trees lack this property.

## *The Shansabani*

The ruling family of Ghur have long been the Shansabani family, who claim Zahhak (see earlier) as their first ancestor. Sultan Ala'uddin Hussain, known as Jahansoz ("World Burner"), took Ghur from the Ghaznavids with the help of his demonic patrons, and he and his kin ruled over Ghur (and later Khurasan) with an iron fist. The Shansabani brooked no dissent or disaffection, and any political troublemakers simply disappeared mysteriously. The sultans of Ghur pursued an aggressive policy with their neighbors, but fortunately for Persia, their attentions were drawn to the fabled east rather than

west or south. They were divided into three branches: one ruled Bactria and Badakhshan from Bamiyan, another ruled Khurasan from Ghazni, and the main branch ruled Ghur from Firuzkuh.

The last Shansabani sultan was Mohammed al-Ghuri, and he was a host to Zahhak. The Shansabani never conceded the province and have not been officially replaced, but they have all vanished. Some claim they have left Persia for Mythic Hind; others claim they have gone into hiding. One persistent rumor places the Shansabani heir at the court of Genghis Khan.


a consequence, Ghur is a dangerous land, and many of its roads are haunted by malicious jinn. The towns are home to demons that walk in human form, and the Ghurs live in permanent suspicion of their neighbors, and even members of their own family should they start to act in an unusual manner. In some towns, the demons have

taken over and rule openly, and the hu-

mans are powerless to stop them.

## *Bamiyan*

A rich yet unfortified city in the east of the Ghur district, Bamiyan was recently one of the three capitals of the Shansabani. Its people are infidels and pay respect to two great idols high up on the mountainside. In a chamber supported on columns are two statues cut into the living rock; the locals call these *Surkh* and *Khing* ("Red" and "Gray," respectively) and in the convoluted religion of Bamiyan they are twin aspects of a single god. The chamber in which these idols are found is richly decorated with carvings of birds, which have been covered in beaten gold. The two idols wander occasionally from their mountainside nook, bringing a Faerie aura with them as they come. When Khing walks, the people of Bamiyan hold feasts in its honor and bedeck it with flowers, but when Surkh fares abroad they hide within their houses and tremble.

## *Firuzkuh*

The summer capital of the Ghurids, Firuzkuh means "turquoise mountain" in the local dialect due to the preponderance of that mineral, along with silver, in the surrounding hills. Firuzkuh was a retreat used by the Shansabani to keep their wicked activities hidden. Many of their political enemies were brought in secret to Firuzkuh, and drowned in the Hari river. Some claim that Firuzkuh was the center of devil-worship by the Shansabani. The palace is now empty, although the ghosts of the family's victims still stalk its halls.

#### **The Minaret**

Located on a bend in the Hari River, the Minaret of Firuzkuh stands over 200 feet high, and is made of baked bricks. It is intricately decorated with glazed tiles bearing alternating bands of Qur'anic verses, geometric patterns, and calligraphy in multiple scripts. The verses from the *Qur'an* are taken from the *surat Maryam*, which relate to Mary, the mother of Jesus. The minaret has been under assault from the jinn of the Hari, and just recently the mosque to which the minaret was attached was destroyed in a flash flood. The minaret stands firm against their attacks, for it is powerfully warded against supernatural creatures. Sahirs have spend long years trying to figure out the means by which it is protected, but the minaret's secrets have so far eluded them, other than to determine it is of Divine origin.

## *Ghazni*

Formerly the capital of the mamluk of Ghur, but now abandoned by the Shansabani, Ghazni is famous for the Bahramshah mosque, which has minarets with a star-shaped cross-section, covered in geometric patterns. It is also well-known as a fabulously rich city, with ornate decorations on the lowliest of buildings, and ostentatious displays of gold and jewels from its inhabitants. Even the lowliest peasant has a gold necklace or bracelet, and higher status individuals drip with precious gems. These riches derive from the *Wealth of Nations* power of a False God (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 37) worshiped in secret by the Ghaznians.

## *Kabul*

A city greatly frequented by merchants, who travel up the single fortified road to the market to trade with the exotic merchants who also come here from Mythic Hind. Of most interest to the Persians is indigo, which can command a rich price further west. However, a more sinister substance is also sought out: a substance called *myrobalan*, a greasy speckled powder with a spicy nature akin to pepper or cardamom. Myrobalan is of great interest to physicians, since when properly prepared it can have potent curative properties. However, it can induce hallucinations that can be pleasurable (if the myrobalan is prepared with wine) or horrific (if prepared with water). Either sensation proves devastatingly addictive, and the markets of Kabul are littered by myrobalan addicts with their distinctive vacant expressions and dark-stained teeth. Kabul is ruled by a demon known only as "The Shadowed One," who is somehow connected to the trade in myrobalan. None have seen him in person; his four lieutenants control the people on his behalf with their demongranted powers.

# *The Nizari Isma'ili State*

The Isma'ili state is unlike others in the Mythic Middle East, in that it does not exist on maps, or in terms of military might, but rather lies in the hearts of men. It is a small state and widely scattered, nevertheless it is united under a strong devotion to its beliefs and goals, and has successfully resisted all threats aimed against it since its foundation over a hundred years ago. The Nizaris exercise political dominance in Persia, not through their meager territorial successes but through the point of a knife and through magical murder. Rather than meeting their enemies in battle they use subterfuge and deception to eliminate the leaders.

## *History*

In the middle of the 11th century, three apprentice sahirs at the same House of Wisdom in Nishapur — Abu 'Ali al-Tusi, Hasan-i Sabbah, and 'Umar Khayyam became the closest of friends. They swore a pact of brotherhood that if any one of them achieved fame and greatness, he


would share it with his friends. Abu 'Ali al-Tusi was the rising star of the trio, and became vizier to the Seljuk Sultanate (where he gained the laqab of Nizam al-Mulk), and also grand vizier of the Suhhar Sulayman. As agreed, he offered positions to his friends; 'Umar refused, asking instead for the means to continue his studies. Hasan accepted, but only to get close to the vizier. He had secretly become a member of the Isma'ili sect of Islam, and at their instigation, murdered his childhood friend. The Suhhar Sulayman was outraged, but true to the dying wishes of their grand vizier they held fire on their vengeance. Reconciliation between Hasan and the Suhhar Sulayman soon became impossible, and a schism within the Isma'ilis caused Prince Nizar — Hasan's superior — to flee to the mountain fortress of Alamut in Persia.

Hasan-i Sabbah continued to train his devoted followers in the arts of Solomonic magic, and, it is rumored, to command sentient spirits. The Nizari Isma'ilis became feared for their single-minded devotion, using magic to walk in secret, ensorcel minds, kill through poison, and travel vast distances in the blink of an eye. These tactics proved to be shockingly effective, and the Seljuk governor of Persia — despite help from the Suhhar Sulayman — proved incapable of mounting an effective response. The Nizaris were successful in taking key towns, but their strategy merely caused the populace to fear Isma'ilism, rather than embrace it. The Nizaris and the Suhhar Sulayman settled into a pattern of attempting to wipe each other out, but losses on both sides have been roughly equal. The Isma'ili sect have also established a branch in Syria, also based in mountain castles. The most famous member of this branch was Rashid al-Din Sinan (who died in 1193), who became well-known to the crusaders as "the Old Man of the Mountains."

## *A Sect of Assassins*

The sect is divided into seven ranks. The lowest ranks are those of the *fida'i* (devoted one) and *lasiq* (adherent), neither of which are properly initiated into the cult. These ranks perform the assassinations

## *An Assassin by Another Name*

In Syria, the Nizari Isma'ilis have been slandered with the name of "*hashishiyyin*" (smokers of hashish); this sobriquet was adopted by the Crusaders as "assassin," and is the origin of the modern term. The rigidly ascetic Nizaris do not use drugs of any kind, and in any case they would likely interfere with the concentration and planning required for executing their public murders. The name stems instead from the contempt felt for the wild beliefs and extravagant behavior displayed by the Isma'ilis, and in any case is not used to describe the main Persian sect.

In Persia, the Isma'ilis are principally known as the Batiniyya (men of the batin), suggesting that they place too much emphasis on the inner meaning of the *Qur'an*; or the Malahida (heretics), referring to their rejection of shari'a law.

that give the sect its notoriety and political pressure. The first initiated rank is the *mustajib* (respondent), who know some of the mysteries of the cult, but have none of the authority of the next three grades, *da'i*  ("missionary"), *hujja* ("proof") and *dai'd-duat* ("chief missionary"). The seventh and final rank is that of the *imam-qa'im*, the mystical teacher and spiritual leader of the sect.

The Nizaris are organized into *jaziras* ("islands"), each representing a geographical territory, and under the control of a hujja. The da'is within each jazira are responsible for preaching the doctrines of the sect and spreading the Isma'ili faith. Each hujja reports directly to the dai'd-duat, who is the head of the sect and grand master of Alamut. Members of the sect commonly refer to each other as *rafiq*, "comrade."

#### **The Da'wa**

The *da'wa* (mission) is the philosophy and organization of the Nizaris. A core doctrine is that of *taqiyya*, the concealment of one's beliefs in the face of danger. Islam stresses the importance of truth and honesty, and yet taqiyya allows the Isma'ilis to deny their adherence to its precepts and live in secret among others. It permits them to use subterfuges and disguises without betraying their faith in God.

Nizaris believe in the inner meaning, or *batin*, of the *Qur'an*, holding that it contains the very secrets of the universe if the layers of symbolism and numerical correspondence can be understood. They live an ascetic life according to the 51 epistles of Isma'ilism, called the *Rasa'il*. They believe that shari'a law no longer applies to those who embrace the batin*,* and consequently, they reject the five Pillars of Islam (and hence receive no benefit from them; see *Realms of Power: The Divine*, page 106), dietary restrictions, the authority of the caliph, and so forth.

According to the da'wa, ever since the creation of the world, human history has been characterized by alternating cycles, each begun by a "speaking" imam or prophet (the imam-qa'im), followed by a succession of "silent" imams. They hold that the imam represents God's will in the world at all times, that he is constantly under divine guidance since the batin flows through him, and that his commands demand absolute obedience. Nizar was a member of the true line of silent imams, followed by Hasan-i Sabbah and the other dai'd-duats of Alamut.

The imam-qai'm is an immortal being of unlimited wisdom, who has been, in the past, Elijah, Enoch, Khidr, and 'Ali (the first Shi'i imam). It is believed that the current cycle is the *qiyama* ("resurrection"), and that the souls of those who follow the da'wa are already in heaven, whereas the souls of all other Muslims — plus those of a non-Muslim faith — have already been judged and suffer in hell.

## *The Nizaris Today*

The current dai'd-duat of the Nizari Isma'ilis is Jalal al-Din Hasan, who succeeded in 1210. During his rule, Jalal al-Din has done the unthinkable — publicly con-



## *New Nizari Virtues*

#### **New Virtue: Fida'i**

*Social Status, Minor*

The character is an assassin of the Nizari Isma'ilis. A fida'i is a devout member of the sect who is prepared to die on its orders, and as such he should consider taking either the Oath of Fealty or Dutybound Flaw. When not on a mission, a fida'i wears white, with a red girdle, cap, or boots. He has been trained in precise placement of daggers and blades, as well as disguise. Fida'i may take Martial Abilities at character creation. He can expect to become a lasiq if he proves his loyalty to the sect.

#### **New Virtue: Lasiq**

*Social Status, Major*

The character is an experienced assassin of the Nizari Isma'ilis, having successfully completed seven murders at the orders of his grand master, and commands a small band of up to six fida'is. Lasiq may take Martial Abilities at character creation.

#### **New Virtue: Mustajib**

*Social Status, Free*

This Virtue is the Nizari equivalent of the Sahir Virtue. The character has been initiated into the magical traditions of the Nizaris, and must take Solomonic Sihr as his Summoning Power. If a mustajib has The Gift, he has been Opened to all of the Solomonic Arts; if he is unGifted, then the Solomonic Arts must be bought as Virtues or else be Initiated after character creation. Un-Gifted characters should also take the Necessary Condition and Prohibition Flaws to represent Initiation by the Nizaris. Mustajib may take Academic and Arcane Abilities at character creation. Most mustajibs started their careers as fida'is, and typically have this Virtue (or the Lasiq Virtue) to represent their social status among non-magical folk. However, if he joined the sect later in life he may choose different Social Status Virtue.

#### **New Virtue: Trained Assassin**

*General, Minor*

This Virtue is only available to characters with one of the three Social Status Virtues of the Nizaris. He has completed several missions on behalf of his masters, giving him 50 additional experience points that may be spent on any Martial Abilities as well as Athletics, Guile, or Stealth.

## *Initiation Scripts of the Nizaris*

Two example Initiation Scripts are given here. Nizaris are almost always Initiated into Solomonic Storytelling in preference to other Solomonic Arts.

#### **Initiation of Solomonic Sihr and the Rank of Mustajib**

**Ease Factor**: 21 **Script Bonus**: +18

**Details**: This rite takes place at Alamut during Ramadan (+3). The Initiate is taken to the garden and magically transported to the Magic Realm by his mystagogue (using Solomonic Travel). He finds himself in an insula (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 19) of intense paradise, populated with beautiful maidens to cater to his every need. He must quest to find himself a companion spirit through which he will work his magic (+3), and in the process of this quest his magic is bound very closely to a weapon that represents that spirit, imposing the Necessary Condition (brandishing a weapon) onto all of the character's magic (+9).

When he returns to the mundane world with the vision of paradise still filling his head, he is told that the master of Alamut can return him to paradise at any time, and he is promised a place in paradise permanently if he dies in his service. In return he swears a magically-enforced oath to never betray the secrets of the sect, lest he be damned to eternal fire (the Prohibition Flaw, +3).

The ritual that Opens the Arts of a Gifted Nizari has similar elements to this Initiation, although it does not impose any Flaws.

#### **Initiation of Solomonic Storytelling**

**Ease Factor**: 21 **Script Bonus**: +15

**Details**: The initiate is asked to surrender all contact with the outside world and devote himself to the sect. He must donate all his possessions and land to the Nizaris, and cut off all ties with family and friends. Even his name is changed to a cultic name (+2).

The initiatory rite takes place at Alamut when Sirius rises (+3); the initiate is taken once more to the paradise insula within the Magic Realm. He must quest on at least three different insulae (thus navigating the Void that separates them), and obtain three objects that resonate with three different emotions (+6).

Upon returning to the mundane world, he must spend a season composing an encoded poem which tells of his journey while appearing to be about an entirely different subject, demonstrating his mastery of the batin (+1).

After this second visit to paradise, the mustajib discovers that any use of his magic briefly transports him mentally back there (simulated by the Disorientating Magic Flaw, +3).


verted the sect to Sunni Islam. The Nizaris recognize this as an exercise in taqiyya and have obeyed without question. Jalal al-Din expects to garner support from the enemies of the Khwarazm-shah, namely the Caliph of Baghdad in the west and Genghis Khan in the east. He has already made alliances with the rulers of Arran and Azerbaijan, and married the four daughters of the emir of Gilan. Since he has ushered in a new era

Relations with the Suhhar Sulayman are hostile; the Suhhar still holds the Nizaris as traitors and refuses to treat with them. Many sahirs attempt to slay or drive off known Nizaris, most often using the fear and hatred of the populace against them. The Nizaris, on the other hand, have no specific enmity towards the Suhhar Sulayman, but treat them like any other powerful individual — if they stand in the way of the imam's coming, then they die.

of outward law, many of Isma'ilis believe

Jalal al-Din to be the imam-qa'im.

In addition to Daylam, Quhistan, and Qumis (mentioned earlier), the Nizaris have significant hidden communities in the south of the Zagros Mountains in Fars (including the fortress of Shardiz), and scattered cells in most of the important cities in the Mythic Middle East. The Syrian Assassins have their base at Masyaf in the Holy Land, with a further stronghold near Aleppo.

#### **Alamut**

Alamut was built by one of the kings of Daylam; he was out hunting one day and his eagle alighted on a rock. He immediately saw the strategic potential of the site, and built a castle there that he called *aluh-amut*, which in the Daylami language means "the eagle's lesson." Since then, Alamut has become more than just a castle; it is a fortified village in Rudbar, the valley of the Shahrud.

Alamut is physically an immense, towering rock, with unapproachable slopes on all sides, and yet a flat top on which extensive buildings have been constructed. It has vast storerooms hollowed out from the very bedrock, and possesses its own spring. A notable feature amid the dust and rock is a luxurious garden; this is the source of the fortress's Magic aura of 3, and it contains a link to the Magic Realm important in the initiatory rituals of the Nizaris (see later).

## *Nizari Characters*

The rank of fida'i is suitable for grog and companion characters, who should take the Dutybound Flaw (or, for companion characters, the Oath of Fealty Flaw) to represent the vows of obedience taken to the grand master of the sect. If a fida'i proves himself to be capable, he can expect to be elevated to the rank of lasiq, and command a squad of men. Only a fraction of the Nizaris become Initiated into the magical traditions of the sect, and become mustajibs. The rank of da'i (which is not represented by a Social Status Virtue) is awarded to mustajibs who have Initiated at least two Solomonic Arts other than Solomonic Sihr; all Gifted mustajibs are automatically da'is. A da'i is expected to lead a community of Isma'ilis and to convert others to the cause. The ranks of hujja and dai'd-duat are both available to player characters through roleplaying.

Apart from those things noted in the inserts nearby, mustajibs (and da'is) should be created using the rules for sahirs (see Chapter 3: Order of Suleiman).


## *Chapter Nine*

# *The Silk Road & Beyond*

The fabled route to distant Serica, the land of silk, is beginning to coalesce again at the beginning of the 13th century, as the Mongol invasion paradoxically creates a degree of safety for traveling merchants and missionaries by controlling the almost incessant brigandage of the area. Later to become known as the Silk Road, the route has existed throughout antiquity in various states of accessibility. It consists of not one road but many — a network of caravan stages, marked by resting places known as caravanserais, that branches and reforms through the deserts, steppes and mountains as the caravans travel northeastward from Baghdad. Through Khurasan and into the Eastern Provinces of Transoxiana, Badakhshan, and Wakhan, the trade routes delve past the borders of Mythic Middle East and even into the supernatural Realms beyond.

# *Transoxiana*

Beyond the great river known to the ancients as the Oxus lay the borderlands of Mawara'n-nahr, "the Lands Beyond the River." Known first as Turan to the Persians, then later as Transoxiana to the Greeks and Romans, these lands have always been at the edge of civilization. Nominally ruled by the Khwarazmshah, the region includes the ancient oases of Farghana, Sogdia and Bactria, the estuarine province of Khwarazm, and the jinn*-*infested desert of Kyzylkum ("red desert") — all bordered by the endless northeastern steppes and the harsh eastern mountain arc of the Pamir and Paromisidae.

Invaded by the triumphant Arabs under Qutayba in the seventh century, Transoxiana was washed over by the Islamic empire until its wave of conquest broke on the shores of the vast inland steppe. Islam itself changed and adapted as it flowed into the steppe — orthodox Sunni practices found little hold, but the ecstatic brand of Sufi mysticism, with similarities to the shamanism of the Turkish nomads and a focus on highly charismatic holy men, was more successful. Many of the inhabitants profess Islam but cling to many pagan beliefs and folk traditions linked to the local Faerie and Magic spirits.

The region has a history of loose pastoralist domination and local dynasties centered on riverine oases. No single authority has ruled the borderlands between the pastoralist nomads and the urban settlers since the ancient Turk Empire, although this is about to change as a new nomad empire descends from the east.

## *The Great Rivers*

Transoxiana is bordered and defined by the two great rivers that flow through it — a liminal zone of cultural transition and trade, bordering the deserts


south of the Aral Sea and forming a bar-

rier between wild nomad steppes to the north beyond the Jaxartes and the urban settlements of the south across the Oxus. A third lesser river, the Zeravshan ("the golden"), courses past the great cities of Samarkand and Bukhara only to choke into dust in the deserts before reaching one of the inland seas.

#### **The Oxus**

Mistakenly associated with the Hebrew Gihon, one of the four rivers that flows into Eden, the great waterway known as the Jahyun to the Arabs, the Amu Darya to the Turks, and the Oxus to the classical Greeks has always been considered one of the frontiers of the classical world. Locals of the high Pamir village of Qarabolaq claim it is birthed from the eerie Lake Zorkul nearby, but the classic geographers claim it begins its journey as it melts from a great ice cave beneath a glacier high up in the fabled Wakhan corridor.

The original bed of the Oxus runs westward across the desert for six days march before reaching the shores of the distant Bahr Khazar (Caspian Sea) near the fishing town of Khalkhal. This former stretch of the river is devoid of magical spirits as they have all been bound into the structures and canals near Gurganj, but nevertheless retains a fading Magic aura of 2 along its dusty length. On cool nights, when the constellation of Aquarius is ascending, small clear pools of water can be found along the dry bed and can be harvested for Aquam vis.

#### **The Jaxartes**

Also known as the Sayhun or the Nahr-ash-Shash ("the river of Shash"), the Jaxartes forms from numerous mountain streams in the valley of Farghana, flowing through this province past the homeland deserts of the Ghuzz Turks via many channels into the northeastern part of the Buhayrah Khwarazm (Aral Sea). More so than its greater sibling to the south, the Jaxartes forms the true border between Iran and Turan, Persian and Turk, civilized agrarian and barbaric nomad.

## *Story Seeds for The Great Rivers*

#### **A River Runs Through It**

*The Cradle & The Crescent*

In winter, both the lower Oxus and the Jaxartes freeze over, allowing merchant caravans (and lately nomad armies) to cross with ease. The cause of this phenomenon is an ongoing struggle between the Faerie and Magic jinn that claim dominance of the lands on either side of the great rivers. In winter, the local Faerie spirits hold sway and the rivers freeze over, allowing nomads and their stories to cross between the steppe and settled lands, engendering conflict and vitality for the faeries to feed off. In summer, the ancient Magic spirits resume their dominance, allowing the waters to flow in their natural course and providing irrigation to the towns of their lower reaches.

#### **Spirits of the Oxus Delta**

Once a single mighty Magic Spirit, the clash of cultures along its lower banks has split the great spirit into a multitude of lesser entities as the river splits into numerous waterways and canals as it approaches the Aral Sea. Just short of this lake, the river is prevented from following its natural course by the great dykes of Gurganj, solid structures magically reinforced with captive jinn enslaved by the ancient sahirs of pre-Islamic times. The sequence of dams that disrupt the natural course of the river allow irrigation of the rich province via many canals.

Faerie, Infernal, and Magic (perhaps even Divine) lesser river spirits can be found along the river's fragmented lower course, bound to its network of canals. Each spirit has its own unique name and cultural allegiance, although shifting alliances and swirling courts appear to collect from time to time.

One such lesser captive Magic spirit, Ahurani or Anahit, represents the vestige of a pre-Zoroastrian fertility spirit, or yazata, adopted by the Sogdians, now yoked to supply the harvests of the Khwarazmshah. The greater Faerie nobles known locally as Old Jahyun and the Son of the Oxus are known to be the most capricious and most powerful, although a clever magus or sahir may be able to bargain with one at the expense of the other.

#### **The Jaxartes River Spirit**

Unlike the Oxus, the Jaxartes is dominated by a single Faerie entity that involves itself in stories of nomad incursions. The ancient Jaxartes spirit feeds on the fear of the urban oasis dwellers of the rapacious barbarians of the steppes, orchestrating an invasion every few centuries by summoning a Faerie host with a new name through the gateway to Arcadia that lies just outside of Talas. See "The Endless Nomad Cycle" Story Seed later.

#### **The Sea of Khazar**

The Bahr Khazar (Khazar or Caspian Sea) forms the northwestern boundary of Transoxiana. Beyond its expanse to the northwest once ruled the mythical Khazars, a powerful kingdom of nomads that converted to Judaism in the ninth and tenth centuries. This lost kingdom held back the Islamic expansion in the ninth century, only to fade back into the steppes from where it arose. Stories about their far realm continue filter all the way back into Mythic Europe, even to the court of the popes.

Although the Khazars have long since dispersed, the stories they engendered have spawned Faerie jinn that imitate their culture and kingdom. Those seeking the far northwestern shores of the sea past the Caucasus range, either by land or by water may encounter the secret isle of the Amazons (see *Rival Magic* for details). Brave travelers that push further find themselves in the magical lands of the jinn and beyond, having delved into those outer parts of Jinnistan that lie in either the Faerie or Magic Realms.



## *Genghis Khan and the Fall of Transoxiana*

"O people, know that you have committed great sins, and that the great ones among you have committed these sins. If you ask me what proof I have of these words, I say it is because I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you."

> — Temujin (Genghis Khan), as reported by Juvaini in *History of the World Conqueror*

At the beginning of a canonical **Ars Magica** saga set at the start of 1220, Genghis Khan and a large detachment of his horde are encamped outside the besieged town of Bukhara. If history follows its course, the town will have fallen within two weeks, the surviving defenders put to death without exception. All the civilians are ordered from the town; artisans are sent as slaves to Mongolia, young men forced to follow the army, and the women suffered far worse fates. A great fire breaks out and almost entirely destroys the mostly wooden buildings and by the end of winter, there is little but smoking ruins left standing. Due to the atrocities committed in Bukhara, the whole area becomes overlaid by a Malevolent Infernal aura of strength 3 (see *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, page 15) apart from the small area surrounding the Kalyan minaret. Many of the slain are not given proper burial, allowing their anguished ghosts to roam free throughout the ruins or vulnerable to summoning by necromantic magic.

Throughout 1220, the Mongol armies, reinforced by Turkish recruits and deserters, ravage along the Jaxartes all the way to Khojend in Farghana, destroying the oasis towns of Signak, Jand, Yanikent and Banakat. By the end of autumn 1220, when the horde settles down along the Vaksh River, the Khan's armies have captured the twin capitals of the shah's realm, Samarkand and Gurganj, and chased the Sultan himself across Khurasan to his death on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Within another year, the Mongol juggernaut has penetrated into Persia, sacked Balkh, Merv, Nishapur, and Herat, and routed the Sultan's son Jalal al-Din across the Indus, while the two great generals, Jebe and Subadei, have commenced their great raid into Russia. Abandoned and never resettled, the original sites of the sacked cities may become home to similar Infernal auras, tarnished with the Personality Trait of Wrath. Such places attract lesser demons of destruction, dark faeries, ghul, and malevolent jinn to the Mongol wake and add to the human misery.

## **Saga Seeds: Of Mongols and Magi ...**

Exactly how these events affect your Saga depends on the role the main characters intend to play within the region. For natives of Transoxiana, the Mongol invasion is devastating, resulting in a large loss of life and culture, but it can be used as a stimulus for introducing existing Hermetic characters to the Mythic Middle East. The massive tumult in the area may provide rich backgrounds for the introduction of wandering Mythic Middle Eastern companion characters into Western-based Sagas, similar to the diaspora following the fall of Constantinople to the Latins in 1204. Conventional Hermetic characters or their companions traveling in the area may become caught up in one of the sieges or escape from the sacking of a town and be forced to cooperate with native characters in order to escape back to Christendom, bearing news of the "hurricane from the east" to the disbelieving Order. Trianoma magi seeking to assess the Order of Suleiman may become embroiled in the fight against the Mongol juggernaut. Tytalan magi may be attracted to the conflict engendered, whereas House Tremere's reconnaissance may lead them to become involved in assessing the degree of threat posed by the invaders. Both Jerbiton magi and Redcaps may have links through trade or travel and be drawn into stories involving their mundane connections or family. Necromancers within the Order may be attracted to the sites of the massacres at Otrar, Bukhara, and other Transoxanian cities and be willing to risk their souls amidst the Infernal ruins.

A saga set primarily in the Mythic Middle East could be focused on rebuilding amidst the ruins of Khwarazmshah's state under the foreign yoke of the Mongol Empire. The breakdown of mundane power structures and the scattering of local wizards could tempt Seekers and young Hermetic magi to mount expeditions to explore and perhaps settle in covenants within the fractured polities of the former lands of Alexander's great empire. Stories may run with the usual Spring covenant founding aim but could involve the complexities of dealing with both the foreign mundane civilians and unusual magical natives of the area while interacting with the Mongol aristocracy and the accompanying bureaucracy.

#### **The Aral Sea**

Also known as the Lake of Khwarazm, this shallow and reedy lake is known for its excellent fishing in the southern part, although it is not considered navigable.

In the southeastern corner of the sea lies a small island, called Jabal Jaghrahaz, that has a Magic Aura of 4. The water surrounding the island is perpetually frozen — local folk swear it must be the dwelling of powerful water jinn, the marid Jaghrahaz, but none are brave enough to venture across the frozen water to investigate the small hill that the island contains.

#### **Kyzylkum Desert**

The "red sands" lie between the two great rivers, forming the southeastern border of the estuarine province of Khwarazm and the northwestern border of Sogdiana. Despite tracts of crescent-shaped dunes, much wildlife can be found at its less arid


eastern edge: gazelles, golden eagles, deer and *koulan* (onagers or wild asses).

The northern reaches are the domain of giant lizards known as *waral* or the varanus —remarkably intelligent, their leaders are able to walk on their hind legs and converse in the local language but appear to have only rudimentary magic.

## *Bactria*

Once known as Bactriana and more recently referred to as Tokharistan, the lands cradled by the Oxus and the Caucasus Indicus have long been a melting pot of culture and a cauldron of rebellion. Although annexed as a satrapy by Cyrus the Great, the region resisted the attempts of Alexander to incorporate it into his empire, only to form the center of first the Seleucid Empire and then an independent Greco-Bactrian kingdom.

Despite being conquered by successive waves of nomads — the Sakas, the Kushans, the Sassanids, the Hepthaelites, and most recently the Arab forces — the hinterland of the region retains many of its classical monuments and links to the Faerie powers of Greek myth. Outside of the Theban Tribunal, it contains more classical Greek structures than anywhere else in the Mythic Middle East.

#### **Balkh**

For a long time, the large and ancient city of Balkh was the home of Zoroastrianism, since Zoroaster was born here and is buried within its walls. At the time of the Islamic invasion of Persia, Balkh provided a refuge to the Persian emperor Yezdgird, but in the current era it has thoroughly embraced Islam. The Greek name for Balkh was Bactra, and gave its name to the whole region of Bactria.

#### **The Ruins at Ai Khanoum**

Once an important center for Hellenism in the centuries before Christ, these eastern ruins lie at the confluence of the Jahyun and its tributary, the Nahr Dirgham. Originally founded by Alexander the Great as Alexandria on the Oxus, it was later developed into the important Seleucid city of Eucratidia.

Partial remains of several structures, including a gymnasium, a theater almost the size of the great structure at Epidauros, and several temples to pagan Greek gods, most notably Zeus and Dionysius, give the area an overall Magic aura of 4. The gymnasium is the best preserved building and lies within a level 7 Magic aura, centered upon a pillar engraved with a dedication to both Hermes and Hercules.

#### **Sogdian Rock**

This landmark marks the site of an ancient battle between the forces of Alexander and the rebellious satrap of Sogdia, Oxyartes of Balkh, father of the legendary beauty Roxane. It can only be accessed by little-known mountain paths and its exact location is known to only a handful of local tribesmen. The ancient spirits of the 30 men who fell during the ascent continue to haunt the site but bear no love for the successors of their Persian adversaries.

## *Sogdiana*

Since ancient times a land of merchants and middlemen, Sogdiana remains a place of crossroads and caravans. The major trails from Baghdad cut through the province, passing through Samarkand and on to the Turkish lands beyond. Once

## *Bactria Story Seeds*

#### **Naw Bahar**

A fire temple by the name of Naw Bahar in one of Balkh's suburbs was built in the Sassanian days as a rival to the Ka'ba of Mecca. Its walls are adorned with precious stones, and brocaded curtains are hung everywhere. The walls and floor emit a sweet smell of perfume from centuries of application of unguents. The main building is surmounted by a great cupola 375 feet high, and around this central building there are 360 chambers to host the mobeds.

Although no longer active as a temple it retains a Divine aura of 5. Naw Bahar remains unmolested by time or treasure seekers, and its floors are clean of detritus and vermin. Those intrepid enough to go inside — and few are — report that a fire burns at the center of the temple, although no one is ever seen within. The inside of the temple leads to a Terrestrial Divine regio that shelters a small Zoroastrian community within the higher levels.

#### **Altars of Alexander**

Of further interest to Hermetic Seekers, an altar of Alexander is hidden within one of the temples at the outskirts of the city. As detailed in *Ancient Magic*, page 125, the altars of Alexander have powerful mystical connections to each other, and link to over 70 different sites. A magus, casting a spell using the Arcane Connection Range while touching such an altar, is considered to have an Arcane Connection with a +4 Penetration multiplier to the other shrines, cities, or temples so connected. This site may either provide an entry point into the Mythic Middle East for Seekers investigating other sites or a potential lifeline back to Europe for Hermetic colonists deep within enemy territory.

#### **A Covenant on the Rock?**

Sogdian Rock is a superb natural fortress, riddled with natural caves and carved cisterns capable of holding large reserves of food and water in case of siege. The site is enveloped by a Magic aura of strength 3, although higher auras may exist within the deeper caves. Although isolated, it is a potential base for Hermetic magi wishing to explore the mysteries of the Mythic Middle East.



## *Ship of the Desert*

The two-humped Bactrian camel predominates throughout the wider Mythic Middle East and differs slightly from its cousin, the single humped dromedary, which is more common in North Africa, Egypt, Arabia and the Levant (see Chapter 6: Mythic Arabia for details on dromedaries). Wild camels are rare, although wild Bactrian camels can be found in the far eastern reaches.

#### **Bactrian Camel**

**Characteristics:** Cun –2, Per –1, Pre –4, Com –5, Str +3, Sta +4, Dex –1, Qik –2

**Size:** +2

**Confidence Score:** 0 (0)

**Virtues and Flaws:** Long-Winded; Feral

Scent

**Qualities:** Hardy, Herd Animal

**Reputations:** Ill-tempered beast +3 (throughout Mythic Middle East)

**Combat:**

*Kick (hooves):* Init +0, Attack +3, Defense +2, Damage +4

**Soak:** +4

**Fatigue Levels:** OK, 0/0, –1/–1, –3/–3,

–5, Unconscious

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1**–**7), –3 (8**–**14), –5 (15**–**21), Incapacitated (22**–**28), Dead (29+)

**Abilities:** Athletics 4 (running), Awareness 3 (predators), Brawl 2 (dodging), Survival 5 (home terrain).

**Powers:**

*Smell Water,* 0 points, Init 0: All camels can smell drinkable water for a distance up to two miles.

*Survive Without Water,* 0 points, Init 0: All camels can survive without water for up to two weeks.

**Appearance:** These statistics are for a typical Bactrian riding camel. Known for their stubbornness, resilience and pungent odor, these otherwise docile animals can become very aggressive during mating season. Their ability to last without water for weeks on end and locate buried water makes them the preferred beast of burden for desert crossings.

Camels have been bred, like horses, to have differing traits:

*Bactrian Pack Camel:* Add the Domesticated Quality and gain the Great Bearer Minor Heroic Virtue (*Houses of Hermes: True Lineages,* page 105), which allows the camel to carry twice as much on its back before becoming weighed down and to travel twice as far before becoming fatigued by a journey. Drop the Survival Ability. Most Bactrian camels found in the great caravans are pack camels.

*Wild Bactrian Camel:* Add the Wilderness Sense Virtue and the Greater Immunity: Thirst Virtue. Reduce Communication to –6. Add Defensive Fighter (and therefore an extra Fatigue level), Fast Runner and Herd Animal Qualities. Increase Brawl (dodging) to 4 and add Wilderness Sense (sense sandstorms) 3. A wild Bactrian camel's kick has the following statistics: Init +0 Attack +5 Defense +3 Damage +4.

*War Camel (variant):* Add the Aggressive and Pack Animal Qualities and the Ferocity (when ridden in battle) Virtue. Increase Brawl (hooves) to 5. A war camel's kick has the following modifications to the basic combat statistics given for either the Bactrian camel or a dromedary camel: Init +0 Attack +4 Defense +3 Damage +0. It can be trained to attack as part of a Trained Group with its rider.

Rare Bjornaer magi who are born in the southeastern peripheries of Mythic Europe have been noted with a dromedary or even wild Bactrian camel Heartbeast. Camels are considered to have a melancholic humor with a choleric aspect.

the heartland of the Manichean heresy, it remains a mixture of mercantile religious communities, counting Sunni Muslims, Nestorian Christians, and Jews among its transient population.

#### **Samarkand**

"Everything I have heard about Marakanda is true, except that it is more beautiful than I ever imagined."

 *—* Alexander the Great

Known as Marakanda to the Greeks, the ancient capital of Sogdia on the upper Zeravshan River has been conquered by various conquerors throughout history but remains one of the most populous and cosmopolitan cities of the region. It is the eastern capital of the Khwarazmshah's empire.

To the east of the old city of Marakanda lies Shahr-i-Zindah ("tomb of the living king"), a street of tombs named after the central shrine, the grave of Qusam ibn-Abbas. The remainder of the tombs are entrances to a city of dark Faerie jinn and ghul, giving the street a malevolent Faerie aura of 5 during the day alternating with an equivalent Infernal aura during the night. The shrine forms a forlorn sanctuary amid the darkness, retaining a small Divine aura of strength 2.

If your Saga follows history, in spring of 1220 the armies of Genghis Khan besiege the town. Despite recent fortification, the city falls to the nomad hordes after only five days. The surrendering garrison is executed in batches with ruthless efficiency. The population are moved out of the city to facilitate the sacking and divided up like the unfortunates of Bukhara (see the insert "Genghis Khan and the Fall of Transoxiana" earlier).

#### **Bukhara**

A trading center since ancient times, Bukhara lies on the Zeravshan River downstream of Samarkand in the middle of the Kyzylkum Desert. In the ninth and tenth centuries it was the center of


the Samanid state and was considered the heart of Islamic culture and religious thought, producing such notables from its hinterland as the Persian poets Firdausi and Ridauki. Ibn Sina used the famous library here and the book bazaars were said by al-Biruni to be beyond compare. In the 13th century, Bukhara is home to a large Jewish community — one of the largest non-Hebrew speaking branches of the Diaspora.

The half-buried tomb of Isma'il Samanid (r. 893-907), the founder of the Samanid dynasty, lies just outside the town. Long forgotten by the debauched inhabitants, if your saga follows history, this building will escape the Mongol devastation as the dust of disuse hides it from the horde. A circle in nested squares, a Zoroastrian symbol, is carved above the main door. The building retains a Magic aura of 3 during the night that alternates with a similar strength Divine aura during the day, due to its former use by Zoroastrian mobeds.

The Mongols sack Bukhara at the beginning of 1220 but several sites survive. (See the earlier sidebar on "Genghis Khan and the Fall of Transoxiana" for further details.) The Kalyan minaret is one of the few structures of Bukhara still standing after the Mongol invasion of Transoxiana, being spared by Genghis Khan himself. A folk story tells of how the great nomad stopped to look at the minaret and a gust of wind knocked his hat from his head. He stooped to pick up his hat and then said: "This minaret is the first thing I have ever bowed to." He spared the minaret but not the sheikhs, slaying 200 holy men and having their heads thrown down the nearby well before rising to the pulpit and uttering his famous speech.

From the top minaret's rotunda with 16 arched fenestrations, the muezzin summoned the city's faithful to prayer or warriors kept lookout for enemies. An ornamental frieze of diagonal brickwork covered with Arabic inscriptions encircles the tower's base.

The minaret was once part of the larger Po-i-Kalyan mosque complex — the immediate ruins retain a Divine aura of 5 amid the Infernal aura that comes to cover most of the city ruins after the sacking.


## *Story Seed: Caravans*

An immense variety of goods passes through Transoxiana in the 13th century laden on the packs of asses, camels, horses, or mules, depending on the terrain. Huge caravans return from the northern lands, carrying goods from the steppes of the Volga Bulghars or the northern forests, pass through the towns of Merv, Baghdad, Samarkand, or Khojend, and thence further west to Europe via Venetian merchants or east via Sogdian merchants to fabled Serica. Caravanserais, stone staging posts with water supplies and a small garrison, were

maintained by local rulers at intervals of a day's journey (10 to 15 miles) to supply the merchant trains. Some caravans resembled miniature towns on the move, one of the largest ones being noted by the geographer Ibn-Fadlan consisted of up to 3000 pack animals and 5000 men.

Such a caravan may become an interesting cover for a covenant of peregrinatory Hermetic magi or provide protection for a group of native Mythic Middle Eastern characters. Either scenario may be a source of varied stories based around trade and exploration.



## *Story Seeds for Bukhara and Otrar*

#### **The Sheikhs Beneath the Well**

The Po-i-Kalyan mosque's well lies beneath an octagonal platform nearby. If uncovered, explorers can climb down the dry shaft to the base, which contains a pile of loosely stacked skulls within a small Magic aura of strength 3. Each skull acts as an Arcane Connection to the sheikh it once belonged to and can be used to summon the restless spirit of that particular holy man. Beneath the base of the minaret itself lies the grave of an imam ritually slain by the tower's builder, Arslan Khan.

#### **The Lost Books of Bukhara**

After the Mongols raze Bukhara in early 1220, several rumors circulate as to the fate of the various book collections and libraries. Much poetry is written lamenting the loss of this great collection of scholarly works, comparing it to the burning of the Great Library of Alexandria. Such tales, woven over the years by gifted poets and the Merinita magi of the Keepers of Tales Mystery Cult, attract faeries to the story. Eventually, the collective lamentation may provide enough vitality to reproduce a Faerie replica of the library. Access to such a place would be greatly sought after by mundane, Hermetic and sahir scholars searching for lost secrets and classical knowledge.

The faeries associated with the library take the form of rare books, appearing unexpectedly in market stalls run by eccentric merchants or being found serendipitously in the disused sections of old mundane libraries. The books themselves are Faerie creatures and act as Threshold Guardians — by reading the Faerie text and wishing to rediscover the lost library, the readers find themselves in Arcadia. Such stories are always tinged with tragedy and sadness, for a reader may visit the library but once and leave with only a small token of his travel and memories to spread the legend of the Lost Library further within the hearts of scholars throughout Mythic Europe. Such loss and longing provides further vitality to the faeries of the library, as its story weaves into similar tales and creates a lasting motif through the centuries.

#### **Job's Spring**

At the edge of Bukhara's farmers' market lies a small mausoleum, the Chashma-Ayyub, recently built over a small strength 3 Faerie aura containing a small spring. Unlike other mausoleums, no one is buried within its walls. Local folklore describes it as the place where Job struck his staff to the ground and called forth water, but perhaps the legend just represents the adoption of an older pagan tradition. Visited annually by one of the sahirs of the local bayt al-hikma who sponsored the recent construction, the resident Faerie jinn can be bargained with for the faerie-tainted Terram and Aquam vis produced by re-enacting the ancient story within its walls. When the local sahir goes missing, who is to blame — angered jinn or a jealous rival seeking to usurp the vis source?

#### **Uqana, the Ghostly Ambassador**

The ambassador of the first embassy to the Khwarazmshah was Uqana, a Muslim merchant trusted with a personal message of friendship from the great Khan. His execution at the hands of a fellow Muslim has resulted in a restless spirit, trapped as an apparition after death (see *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 115, for details of this class of ghost). Although the great Khan has avenged his murder, Uqana is unable to rest, as his spirit feels he failed in his duty to deliver his message. Convincing the traumatized ghost to depart to his proper rest will be difficult, given the wake of destruction that the Mongols have left since their affront at Otrar. If compelled by magical means, Uqana may provide valuable information about the intentions and plans of the Mongol leaders. Attempting such magical coercion or lying convincingly to gain the former ambassador's trust may have grave consequences within the Infernal aura that encompasses his haunt.

The minaret itself contains a Divine aura of 7. By climbing the spiral staircase just prior to dawn, a devout Muslim can access a small Terrestrial divine regio of strength 8 that appears as a round chamber above the rotunda section.

#### **Kasri Orifon**

A small village just east of Bukhara, this site is known for the "wishing tree." The dead trunk of an ancient mulberry tree forms a twisted arch in the main square. Barren women crawl beneath its trunk in the hope of becoming with child. The tree is home to a Faerie jinn with powers over fertility passing beneath the wood of the arch leads to a small strength 2 Faerie regio just large enough for an adult human to enter.

#### **Otrar**

In 1218, a Mongol ambassador arrived at the head of a richly laden caravan in this town on the eastern bank of the Jaxartes, carrying a message to the Khwarazmshah. Governor Inalchuq, a cousin of the Khwarazmshah, imprisoned and executed the entire caravan of 450 men, including the ambassador, on the basis that he believed they were spies or perhaps merely out of greed for their valuable wares. The execution of ambassadors was considered a grave insult to the Mongol leader — one underlined by the subsequent humiliation of the Mongols sent in a second embassy. Through this gross insult from a minor official, the Mongol horde descended with devastating effect on the Mawara'n-Nahr.

If your saga follows history, Otrar lasts for five months under siege in the first half of 1220 before succumbing to Mongol


forces. Inalchuq is captured alive but executed by having molten silver poured into his eyes and ears. The town is reduced to rubble and its population slain or enslaved, a prelude to the fate of the other towns in the region. Its ruins contain a Perfidious Infernal aura of strength 6, tarnished with the sin of Deceit. Lies told within the ruins seem more believable — attempts to spot a lie have their Ease Factor increased by the aura strength.

## *Khwarazm*

A province of canals and gardens, Khwarazm is the agricultural heart of Transoxiana and the home to the bellicose Khwarazmshah whose actions brought down the wrath of the Mongol hordes, Sultan Mohammed II Iskander. It produces large crops of cotton, sustains large flocks of sheep for wool, and pastures great herds of cattle in the marshlands among its multitude of canals. Its main industry is trade, including expensive

## *Elephants in Persia*

The elephant was considered a prize war animal by the Persian armies of antiquity. Small numbers are still found throughout the eastern reaches in the possession of nobles or the Khwarazm military, the former as curiosities and the latter as part of shock troops. Elephants are legendary opponents of dragons and fearlessly attack serpents at any opportunity, but are deathly afraid of the squeal of a sow or boar and will flee this sound unless restrained.

**Natural Weapons:** an elephant's stomp has the following combat characteristics: Init –1, Attack 0, Defense –1, Damage +3. Their trunk is only effective as a grapple.

**Appearance:** The elephant found throughout the Mythic Middle East is the Asian variety. It stands up to 10 feet tall, measures 20 feet long and weighs up to 8,000 pounds. These statistics represent the more commonly domesticated female — only the male elephant has significantly sized tusks to use in combat.

Elephants have excellent hearing and vibration sense through the trunk, gaining a +3 on all rolls involving hearing. An average elephant inflicts +15 damage when dropped onto a human-sized character from on high.

*Male Elephant:* Add Aggressive and change to Brawl 5 (tusks). Add the Extra Natural Weapons, Imposing Appearance x2, Large Horns (Tusks), and Herd Leader Qualities and the Ferocity (defending herd) Virtue. Increase Presence to +1 and Communication to –4. Add Leadership 5 (elephants). A male elephant's Tusk attack has the following combat statistics: Init +1, Attack +9, Defense +5, Damage +13.

*War Elephant:* Add the Aggressive and Pack Animal Qualities. Change to Brawl 5 (stomp) and improve the elephant's Stomp attack: Init –2, Attack +6, Defense +3, Damage +13. Persian war elephants are usually clad in the equivalent of leather or metal scale (add Protection of 3 or more to Soak) and carry a platform known as a howdah which can accommodate up to six soldiers armed with javelins, polearms or bows. They can be trained to fight as part of a Trained Group with their squad of accompanying soldiers under the direction of their mahout or driver.

# **Story Seed: Elephants of Alexander**

The ghosts of ancient war elephants can be summoned at the battle sites of antiquity throughout Arabia, Persia, and Transoxiana, using their bones to call them back to unearthly service. Such sites are of particular interest to House Tremere, who seek to expand the versatility and power of their ghostly forces.

Faerie war elephants from the land of Hind, as used in the armies of Alexander the Great, appear even larger and more fearsome than their mundane kin. Such creatures sport multiple large curved tusks and have been trained to wield spiked balls on chains with their trunks. They prompt panic in lesser creatures and are capable of deafening opponents with their trumpeting. The remains of these giant creatures are found primarily in the far mountains of the eastern provinces and the southern deserts of Persia.



## *The Heavenly Horse of Farghana*

The valley at the headwaters of the Jaxartes has been known for its excellent horses since antiquity. According to legend, the horses of Farghana are offspring of mundane horses and either mountain river dragons or other seemingly divine steeds that visited the wild steppe herds in the past. Such "Heavenly Horses" appear similar to the Arabian-descended horses of the European nobility but are slightly larger. These Faerie animals are particularly sought after by magi and Gifted sahirs due to their suitability as mounts for Gifted magicians, and local tales tell of representatives from Serica traveling vast distances to procure even one of these amazing mounts.

#### **Heavenly Horse**

**Faerie Might:** 5 (Animal)

**Characteristics:** Cun –2, Per 0, Pre +2, Com –4, Str +5, Sta +4, Dex +1,

Qik +3 **Size:** +2

**Confidence Score:** 0

**Virtues and Flaws:** External Vis (minor, bloody sweat), Faerie Beast, Ferocity (when ridden in battle), Long Winded, Improved Characteristic x3, Positive Reputation, Unaffected by The Gift; Incognizant, Proud (minor), Susceptible to Deprivation.

**Qualities:**Amphibious, Domesticated, Fast Runner, Good Jumper, Herd Animal, Imposing Appearance x3, Tireless.

**Personality Traits:** Spirited +3, Loyal +2 **Reputations:** Dragon-steed 2 (local) **Combat:**

*Hooves:* Init +4, Attack +2, Defense +6, Damage +6

**Soak:** +4

**Wound Penalties:** –1 (1**–**7), –3 (8**–**14), –5 (15**–**21), Incapacitated (22**–**28), Dead (29+)

**Pretenses:** Athletics 4 (long-distance running), Awareness 3 (noises), Brawl 2 (hooves), Swim 4 (rivers).

#### **Powers:**

*Heavenly Hooves,* 2 points, Constant, Animal: This power allows the animal to move at its maximum speed, unimpeded by poor terrain, achieving up to 30 miles per day. It may even do this across open water or chasms without needing to slow its pace. ReAn 25 (Base 10, Sun +2, +1 Constant): Personal Power, 25 levels.

**Appearance:** These horses appear similar to other mid-sized breeds of charger, although even an experienced horse trainer will find it difficult to ascertain its origin. Usual specimens stand just under 16 hands (62 inches) high but appear more refined than even the finest mundane horse.

These Faerie mounts are believed to be descended from river dragons east of the valley of Farghana. Unlike mundane horses, they are not affected by the negative effects of The Gift or Magical Air of their riders. Even a Blatant Gift does not especially bother the animal.

These Faerie horses are also renowned for their unusual trait of sweating blood. The crimson sweat is produced by any significant physical exertion, but does no harm to the creature. If properly collected over the course of a year, such sweat acts as a Vis Source and provides 1 pawn of faerietainted Animal vis per year. As a faerie, it does not suffer from fatigue or age, although it does suffer the usual consequences if it lacks air, food, and water in its role as a magical steed.

Like all horses, a Heavenly Horse gets a +3 to all rolls involving running or jumping. These creatures are not balanced to be used as player characters.

furs from the lands of the Bulghars to the north. Khwarazm is particularly known for its Turkish slaves, however, and is the center of the slave trade in Transoxiana. Young nomads are bought or stolen from the steppes, given an Islamic education, and then dispatched to the far corners of the Islamic Empire.

#### **Gurganj**

A leading town along the trade routes, the town of Gurganj or Al-Jurjaniyah has shifted its site on the western bank of the river over the years to accommodate the vagaries of the floodwaters of the Oxus and the vengeance of the native river spirits.

If your saga follows history, the Mon-

gols besiege Gurganj in 1220, breaking the massive dyke in frustration after five months and unleashing the pent-up waters of the Oxus. Once again, the city falls to the onrushing waters and the great river resumes its flow into the Caspian Sea, releasing the enslaved magical spirits upon their former Khwarazmian captors (see the sidebar on Spirits of the Oxus Delta, earlier). All that will remain after the Mongols march away from the town are sundry corpses and the ruined walls that sketch the outline of the oncegreat city.

#### **Kath**

Former capital of Khwarazm and original home of the native Khwarazmshah dynasty, this once-magnificent city on the eastern bank of the Oxus has suffered repeated flooding throughout its history, washing it into secondary rank.

Overlooking a great necropolis to the north stands the mausoleum of Il-Arslan.

## *Farghana*

To the northeast of Sogdiana lie the open plains of the vast valley of Farghana, the most eastern point reached by the initial wave of expansion sparked by Islam. Famous for its horses, metal goods, and particularly its weapons, it also has fine oil and bitumen. Arab armies are using clay pipes filled with oil as incendiaries in sieges, a tactic later adopted by their Mongol conquerors.



Framed at the mouth of the Farghana valley, this small trade town is built near the ruins of Alexandria Eschate: the furthest settlement established by Alexander the Great in his campaign of conquests. Another Altar of Alexander lies hidden beneath the city or within the adjacent ruins (see Ruins at Ai Khanoum earlier for details).

#### **Osh**

Located just downstream from the source of the Jaxartes in the Pamir mountains, Osh is the easternmost settlement in the Farghana valley and the northernmost town of the Islamic Caliphate, making it the end of certainty and the starting point for stories of exploration past the map's edge.

Osh is the last caravan stop on the Great Khurasan Road from Baghdad. Merchants follow tales and legends rather than tracks as they climb into the eastern mountains on their way to the fabled Faerie city of Khashgar and thence by the dreaded desert route to legendary Serica.

## *The Gutluk-Temir Minaret*

The tallest brick minaret of the Mythic Middle East, this structure rises to over 180 feet, providing a dominating view of the surrounding irrigated province. Despite the religious style, it is surrounded by a Magic aura of 7 and forms the focus of the magical network of fetters and wards that binds the various Oxus river spirits to the dykes noted earlier. The protective magics of the minaret are maintained by the local community of sahirs, who use the structure as their meeting place and ensure the canals continue to support the province's famed fertility. The sahir community lies directly in the path of the onrushing Mongol horde — the few survivors may be some of the first Solomonic magi to bear news to their brethren in the west.

## *Badakhshan*

Fabled for its rubies, sapphires, and other jewels, this mountainous region rises upwards into the Caucasus Indicus south of a great northern loop of the Oxus, transected by its main tributary, the Nahr Dirgham (Badakhshan or Kokchka River). Known in antiquity as Balascia, classical geographers place it on the north face of the southeastern slopes of legendary Mount Imeon. Now free from the demonic yoke of the Shansabani of Maiyan to the south, it is one of the borderlands of the ancient world known to the traders who traverse it from northwest to southeast.

#### **Wakhan**

This narrow territory follows the Oxus River from lower Badakhshan back to its mythical source. It is inhabited by reclusive pastoralists known as the Vakhi who speak an almost unintelligible dialect of Parsi (–3 penalty to Ability score). Since

## *Badakhshan Story Seeds*

#### **The Faerie Road to Serica**

Unlike the lower reaches, the whole upper valley of the Oxus past its junction with the Badakhshan River is covered by a extremely lengthy but narrow Faerie aura bounded by the sharp mountain crest lines to the north and south. Beginning with a weak aura of only 2 at the outskirts of Ai Khanoum, the aura increases gradually as a traveler climbs further east. At the level of the Wakhan Valley proper, the aura has reached a strength of 6 and the Warping it induces is partly responsible for the taciturn nature of the nomads (Reclusive Minor Flaw). Multiple Faerie regiones can be accessed from the path, depending on the traveler's mood, goals, and particular Faerie Sympathies (see *Realms of Power: Faerie* for further details). Some of these regiones lead only to blind canyons and certain death, while others contain whole lost kingdoms and cities built on the shores of a great encroaching desert. The most sought-after paths provide portals into the various worlds of Faerie. Those leading to Arcadia are commonest although a solitary traveler is more likely to be drawn into Eudokia to resolve the crisis that has led them to flee beyond the bounds of Hermetic knowledge.

#### **Itineris Serica**

Cartophilius of Mercere has always been regarded as eccentric, even among Mercere magi. His father, Geographicus, was one of the founders of a similar traveling covenant, so it is perhaps unsurprising he has proposed forming another mobile gathering of magi at the recent Normandy Tribunal meeting. The covenant's mundane cover as a merchant caravan is nothing new, but his intent to seek funding as a dedicated research covenant surprised even the archmagi who knew his parens.

Cartophilius intends nothing less than to find the true source of silk by traveling eastward to mythical Serica.

Several members argued against his plan, stating that no precedent for such a Seeker covenant exists, but, surprisingly, the Exarch of House Tremere guaranteed full support for such an expedition and volunteered two experienced Tremere magi to accompany the Mercere's venture. Whether the Exarch's motives were out of true support or just a pragmatic solution to finding an outlet for the more enthusiastic members of the Burning Acorn Vexillation remains in doubt.

This covenant may provide an interesting high fantasy or high Faerie diversion from the usual "castle on the hill by the Faerie wood" trope that is the default of many **Ars Magica** sagas. Possible covenant magi might include a Nestorian Trianoma spy, a Turkish Criamon Sufi master, and a Levantine Merinita jinn specialist.


antiquity, a trade route has wound its way up this valley and on to the mythical land of Serica, although no merchant yet claims to have traveled the whole journey there and back again. On occasion, exotic travelers and pilgrims have appeared in the Mythic Middle East, claiming to have traversed the corridor westwards, reciting tales of their adventures in the mountains and stories about the fabled cities of their homelands in the desolate Taklimakan desert beyond.


Commonly mistaken for sapphire in period, lapis lazuli's name derives from the Latin *lapis* ("stone") and a corruption of the Persian name of its town of origin, Lahzvard (Latin *lazulum*, "from Lahzvard"). Its use in amulets, scarabs, and even seals is documented in various Egyptian and Babylonian magical texts. It is also an essential ingredient in the pigment ultramarine. Such pure pigment is greatly valued for the illumination of Hermetic texts as a highly resonant material, although a lesser pigment made from locally available mineral referred to as *kuanos,* or cerulean (azurite), is often substituted.

Pliny's description of *sapphiros* flecked with gold is believed by many Hermetic lapidary specialists to refer to lapis rather than sapphire (blue corundum). Lapis lazuli has the following shape and material bonuses: +3 aphrodisiac (when ground as a powder), +5 keep limbs healthy, +5 cure boils and ulcers, +6 versus the Obsession power of demons. A Lapis Lazuli of Virtue contains 2 pawns of Corpus vis. When Enriched by carving it in the shape of an eye, set in gold, and placed as an offering on the last day of the month on an altar dedicated to the Egyptian deity Ra, it confers the Minor Supernatural Virtue Lesser Immunity (obsession power of demons) (**ArM5**, page 45). Alternatively, it can be smelted in a crucible with lead to remove its gold flecks. When the result is ground to fine powder and applied to the eyelids, it acts as a potent aphrodisiac equivalent to the wearer having the Venus' Blessing Minor General Virtue (**ArM5**, page 50).

At the Troupe's discretion, only blue gems from beyond the bounds of Mythic Europe may provide the proper "sapphire" bonuses — a potential story idea is that such blue stones may have to be discovered in dreams, Faerie, the Magic realm or as the result of looting dragon hoards. Details of Sapphires of Virtue are given in *Realms of Power: Magic*, page 127.

#### **Story Seed: Untouched Stone**

A senior magus seeks the characters' help with a delicate problem. His attempts to stabilize his new longevity potion require a blue stone the same size as the magus himself as a component, but the cerulean he is using is inadequate for the task. Citing Pliny as an authority, he has determined that he requires the classical *sapphiros.* The stone must be freshly born, at least human-sized, and remain untouched by human hands. Magical manipulation is out, as the resonance will be destroyed if the rock is affected by magic prior to the ritual.

Mining a correctly-shaped hunk of lapis lazuli using indirect magic or mundane means may not represent a great problem, but delivering such a rock to the magus all the way from the mines of Lahzvard in Badakhshan presents a problem. The only guaranteed option is traveling by mundane means through the eastern Caliphate. Given the tumult of the area in the aftermath of the Mongol incursion, such an expedition is bound to present several challenges, not least the risk from bandits or nomads seeking to haul off what is a rather difficult-to-conceal small fortune.

The limestone deposits along the Badakhshan River at Lahzvard are the only source of lapis lazuli known in Mythic Europe. The greedy jinn of Zubaydah, a fort named after the favored wife of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid, oversee the main mine works. From here, strongly guarded shipments of lapis lazuli travel west to supply European artists and magi or are sent east into the fabled lands of Hind, Serica, and perhaps even the adjoining mountainous regions of Faerie.

## *The Roof of the World*

The *Bam-i-Dunya,* or "Roof of the World," refers to the high plateaus of the Pamir knot, the northwestern Caucasus Indicus, and the ranges that extend southward and eastward into lands outside the *Dar al-Islam* ("House of Islam"). The civilizations spawned in the valleys cradled below the peaks have traditionally been the middlemen in interactions between the Roman and Persian Empires to the west and the mysterious land of Serica in the east.

Islamic mythology claims this chain of stone as part of the Mountains of Qaf and thus one of the homelands of the jinn. Valleys strewn with fist-sized diamonds are the roost of the great *ruq*,


massive eagles that can lift a man in one of their claws and carry him away like a small mouse.

In classical texts, the crests of this region are the lesser flanks of Mount Imeon, the mountain at the center of the world, considered by some Criamon magi as the possible original location of the Axis Magica prior to Criamon's ascendance into Twilight.

The whole area is covered by a unspoiled Magic aura of at least 4, although areas with higher auras and regiones of other Realms punctuate its icy expanses.

## *Ruq (cont'd)*

ruq after a successful Grapple attempt. He cannot attempt to free himself from the ruq's talons by opposing the Grapple. ReCo (base 3, +1 Eye, +2 Sun), Lesser Power (10 levels, –2 Initiative, 1 spare intricacy point from 5 unused spell levels).

*Paralyzing Stare,* 1 points, Init –9, Corpus: This power transfixes any humansized target that makes eye contact with the great bird's fearsome stare. ReCo (base 5, +1 Eye, +1 Conc), Lesser Power (15 levels, -2 Might, –1 Initiative from intricacy points)

**Vis:** 3 pawns of Animal, in wingtip feathers

**Appearance:** The ruq appears as a gigantic eagle, with steel-bright eyes and cruelly curved talons. These statistics represent one of the smaller specimens, standing just over 25 feet tall with a wingspan just over 40 feet.

Although a magnificent creature, a ruq (or roc) is not a Beast of Virtue and is not designed to be a player character. This ruq is based on a large falcon or eagle (Size –2) with a base Might of 15 advanced to gigantic proportions. This specimen is large enough to carry off livestock, horses and humans. Larger specimens (Size +8) have been seen to carry off elephants and even giants.

*Golden Eagles:* Used by the eastern Turks and Mongols, the large *burkit* (Size –2) of the steppe are used to hunt foxes and can even be trained to attack wolves. Although similar in appearance to ruq, such eagles use the base characteristics of a falcon given in the *Book of Mundane Beasts* but have the additional Qualities: Grapple and Imposing Appearance x2. Oversized eagles (up to Size 0) are sometimes used by the Ghuzz magic-kin and have their characteristics modified accordingly for their size (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia).



## *Ruq Story Seeds*

#### **The Ruq's Nest**

Faerie ruq also exist, typically acting as Threshold Guardians involving the Path of Chance and stories within Arcadia. Characters attempting to flee the bird's approach may suffer grievous wounds, while those snatched up by the great raptors find themselves cast into strange stories in distant lands, much like the legendary Sinbad the Sailor. Stories tell of whole valleys within regiones beneath their nests lined with diamonds as large as a man's fist, populated by giant-sized Faerie sheep and goats. Successful adventurers who escape to mundane lands may claim such gemstones as the prize for their courage — different gems contain differently-flavored vis according to their nature, although such vis is always Faerie tainted.

The Faerie versions differ only in that they possess the *Spirit Away* Power and replace the (Cloud) Regio Network with the Faerie Speech Virtue, which allows them to fulfill their role as catalysts of high adventure.

#### **Janaindar, the City Above the Clouds**

Local nomad legends speak of a lost city built at the edge of the Magic Realm, seen rising above the clouds atop a great mountain peak on a clear day and all but inaccessible except by magic, or being carried to its aerie by one of the great ruq. The stories say its alien inhabitants claim descent from an ancient magical race that once ruled over the earth, although they appear human in guise.

Is this a lost Nephilim settlement? The true location of Hyperborea in Turkistan? An ancient and reclusive covenant of elder magi? The descendents of a rival magical tradition founded by Trianoma's sister, Viea? The last refuge of the Zoroastrian mobeds? A potential site for a high-fantasy Hermetic covenant above the clouds? The last sanctum of the Diedne?

#### **Turris Lapidae, the Stone Tower**

Ptolemy's *Geography* mentions the small mountain kingdom of Sarikol as the stopping point for caravans heading eastwards towards the fabled Sera Metropolis, the capital of the Seres. Some say the overlooking fort marks the halfway point between Europe and the lands of the East, others claim it is a town half in the mundane world, half in the Faerie Realm that provides a gateway into Arcadia. Descriptions stem from the merchant traveler, Maes Titanos, although his report is considered suspect by Ptolemy's source, the pre-Hermetic wizard Marinus of Tyre who regards the figure of Titanos as a fabrication, Faerie, or an infernalist.

In the Mythic world, this sizable town marks the extent of classical travel to the east and is thus one of the mundane geographical limits of the Order's knowledge of the world. No Redcap or Mercere magus claims to have yet visited this mythical site or entered the fabled tower, leading some Merinita magi to speculate that while it still lies within the mundane world, it can only be reached by passing along the Arcadian paths known to House Merinita.

## *Beyond the Roof of the World*

Travelers' tales tell of fantastical creatures found just beyond the eastern peaks. After the mountains comes the desert, studded by prosperous oasis towns and ruins of lost civilizations. Searing heat, cruel winds, and malicious demons populate these stories, and all contribute to luring travelers from their caravans into lingering deaths from starvation and hunger.

#### **Khashgar**

Of all the legendary cities associated with the eastern journey, Khashgar is perhaps the most widely known in the 13th century. Routes from north and south converge on this mythical oasis city before branching around the dreaded Taklimakan desert on their way eastward to the Land of Silk. Scholars debate its origin and exact location but all agree its streets teem with humans, jinn*,* and other Eastern faeries mixing shoulder to shoulder with angels, demons, and non-Hermetic sorcerers.

Nominally Muslim since the late ninth century, Khashgar suffered repression and intolerance under the Eastern faeries of the Qara Khitai dynasty, but has recently fallen under the Mongol yoke without resistance. The inhabitants, both mundane and magical, appear to have taken the change in overlords without much concern.

Famous for the Yekshenbar bazaar ("Sunday market"), the city is a place where all manner of exotic goods can be bought or sold. Desert brigands mix with worn merchants; exotic silks, knives, and jewelry are displayed alongside more magical

## *Story Seed: The Black and the Blue*

The dunes off the main track are feared as the abode of the *qara buran*  **("black hurricanes"), bloodthirsty wind spirits that assail caravans as mighty sandstorms, separating travelers from their camels and companions. These untamable buran closely resemble elemental jinn in nature, but some creatures appear more akin to**

**Infernal Aerial Powers than to Magical spirits (see Chapter 4: The Jinn). The storm spirits divide their loyalty between the great Gök Buran — a frighteningly powerful Daimon that dwells within an even stronger Magic regio deep within the center of the sands — and its rival, a Duke of Hell known as Great Lop.**


wares. Slaves, both mundane and magical, can be found here, for a price.

Some Merinita claim to have visited the Khashgar market in traveling through Arcadia, and suggest several versions of the city may exist at once, or that the whole town may lie in a regio accessed from several different mundane sites in Mythic Europe.

Ignoring the scholars and their musings, life and commerce goes on in Khashgar.

#### **The Taklimakan**

This magical desert is a place of death — its name translates as "those who go in, never come out." A pair of geographically shifting auras of constant strength 7 (one Infernal, one Magical) swirl and intertwine across the sands as opposing storms. The two spiral-shaped auras constantly envelope and then reveal ancient Faerie regios, which either contain the ruins of long-deserted cities or thriving oases populated by jinn from before the coming of Islam.

# *The Mythic Steppe*

Untamed grasslands stretch for almost unimaginable distances along the edge of the Mythic Middle East, and from them pour the Mongol hordes.

# *Story Seed: The Endless Nomad Cycle*

The ruins of an old nomad fortress lie near the old town of Talas. Just outside is the terminus of a road from Arcadia that leads to a Faerie reflection of the Mythic Steppe. Throughout history, since before the time of Alexander, waves of Faerie nomads summoned by the great Jaxartes river spirit have descended upon the lands of Transoxiana in an eternal cycle of destruction that echoes in the memories and folktales of the people who dwell in the lands beyond the Oxus. Each successive wave carries a slightly different name but brings new terror — the recurring story they enact breaking upon the shores of civilization through eternity. The Mongols may merely represent the latest retelling of the ancient story — see "Gog and Magog" in the sidebar later for further ideas.

## *The Great Steppe*

Even at its height, the Eastern Roman Empire reached only the fringes of the vast ocean of grassland that stretches the breadth of the continent of Asia, from the Sea of Azov and the great gulf of grass forming the Hungarian plain in the west to the Ordos, and extending to the limitless horizon in the east. Herodotus refers to the littoral of this grass lake as Scythia but speaks of its endless and timeless nature — no continuous landscape feature encountered by Hermetic magi is on the same scale.

#### **Tashkent**

The Turkish "City of Stone," once the greatest Arab town beyond the Jaxartes, was laid to waste by the vengeful Mongol hordes in 1219, although the Khwarazmshah had already sacked much of it in 1214. Like other towns in the area, it was a city of canals, famous for its vineyards. It formed a trade center between the latter-day Sogdians and their nomadic Turkic neighbors until the recent Mongol incursion. It is already beginning to be resettled and recover its trade position under Mongol lordship and marks the frontier between civilization and the barbarian wilderness.

#### **Talas**

In July 751 the Muslim armies led by Ziya ben Salih met a strange expeditionary force from beyond the eastern steppes. Although less significant than the Battle of Poitiers in 732 in the west, this confrontation marked the easternmost expansion of the Arab armies.

Many exotic artisans were captured

The majority of horses in the Eastern Provinces are the small but hardy ponies of the steppe's nomad tribes. They are notably different than larger breeds commonly used in Europe, Arabia, and southern Persia presented in the *Book of Mundane Beasts* and *Lords of Men*, Chapter 5: Leisure.

Steppe ponies are bred from the wild horses of the Steppe by the various nomad tribes that range across it. Exceptional Steppe ponies with the Minor Heroic Virtues Great Bearer and Sure Traveler (see *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages*, pages 105-107) are highly prized by the Steppe nomads. Like all light horses, a Steppe pony is a fast runner and gets a +3 to rolls involving running or jumping.


#### in this campaign. The technology of papermaking passed into the Islamic world from such captives, with the first paper mill being built in Samarkand shortly after. Nearly five centuries later, the last Khwarazmshah, Muhammad II, defeated the Faerie forces of the mysterious Kara-Khitai nomad dynasty in 1218 to consolidate

his rule over Transoxiana. The town was razed completely in 1219 by the Mongol

**Appearance:** A fierce-looking eastern warrior on horseback, his upper body lightly covered by fur-lined leather armor, with an acorn-like metal helmet also fringed with fur. He carries a bow in a quiver on his saddle, a saber, and a short spear with a small hook at the base of the blade.

While there are younger soldiers in the Mongol army, this trooper represents the finest specimen that the characters are likely to encounter, the sort of character who would fight in the vanguard during a group engagement, or who might be found singly acting as a scout or guard.

Leading such troopers are experienced generals — usually regular warriors with exceptional talent rather than blood relatives of the Mongol royal family — or hereditary chieftains. The Mongolian generals are experts in strategy and tactics, and most of their successes may be attributed to their superior military intelligence and their ability to quickly assess the nature of the battlefield. Many of their enemies are fooled by a carefully staged organized retreat, their finest maneuver, wherein they seem to pull back and draw their opponents out behind them in a long pursuit to exhaust them, before suddenly turning around and attacking.

An *orlock* (Mongol general) can be created as an older Companion-level character based on the Mongol trooper template earlier, with the following changes as an example. Adjust the characteristics to Int 0, Per +1, Pre +2 (1), Com +1, Str 0, Sta +2, Dex +1, Qik 0 due to possession of the Improved Characteristics Virtue. An example orlock might have the following additional Virtues and Flaws: Affinity with Leadership, Clear Thinker, Improved Characteristics, Inspirational, Puissant Ability (Leadership), Self-Confident, Strong-Willed; Enemies (Mythic Middle East), Outsider, Vow (loyalty to Genghis Khan). They lack the Puissant Ability (Bows) Virtue and Reckless Flaw of their troops. Their Confidence score is increased to 2(5) and they have the following Personality Traits: Resolute +3, Ruthless +5, Cunning +4. The average age of an orlock is 40 and they have the following additional Abilities: Artes Liberales 1 (military communication), Craft Siege Equipment 3 (catapults or mangonels), Folk Ken 2 (nobles), Guile 3 (elaborate lies), Intrigue 3 (alliances), Leadership 6+2 (7)(battlefield), Persian 3 (negotiations). They lack the Bargain ability of the common trooper and have their Bows score reduced to only 5. Their Soak, Fatigue Levels, Wound Penalties, Equipment and Encumbrance remain unchanged but their combat statistics will need to be appropriately adjusted. Individual generals encountered may have slightly different Virtues, Flaws and Abilities.

A few of the Mongols in the army are tribal shamans of Great Tengri, the Mongol sky god. Versed in the power of the spirit world, they can summon spirits to aid them by scouting out the area, attacking supernatural enemies, and spying on their opponents. The rules on Solomonic Summoning in Chapter 3: The Order of Suleiman can be used as a guide, and more complex rules for summoning spirits in this way are found in *Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 114–115. For the sake of simplicity, you may assume that the shaman can easily summon an appropriate Faerie, Magical, or Infernal spirit of Might 30 or less and bargain with it to convince it to do his bidding. These spirits might agree to be bound to a weapon, creating a sort of enchanted device, or commanded to perform a task for the shaman. The shamans employ whatever sort of spirit is convenient to help them accomplish their objectives, even demons.

All shamans have a personal familiar spirit, similar to the qareen noted in Chapter 4: The Jinn. This is usually an ancestor spirit associated with their homeland that follows them and aids them. For examples of these sorts of beings and the powers they have at their command, see *The Mysteries: Revised Edition* or *Realms of Power: Magic* or use the jinn as a guide to creating various elemental spirits.

Note that these hedge wizards differ somewhat from the original shamans presented in *Ancient Magic*, page 18.

Great Sky." Like the original spirit of the Hercynian Forest (see *Guardians of the Forest*, Chapter 3: The Forest, pages 30–40) in the far west, the Great Tengri of the Steppe is a powerful supernatural entity that draws its power from the Magic realm. To Hermetic understanding, this primal spirit is similar to a Kosmokrator of the Steppe and the Sky, an Elder Daimon that governs the vast grass sea of the Mythic Steppe.

#### **Lesser Steppe Spirits**

**Magic Might:** 30-45 (Auram, Terram, or rarely Aquam or Herbam).

All are considered genii loci of their particular steppe.

**Typical Powers:** Creator of Winds or Earth, Guide, Manifestation, Presence, Ruler of Winds or Earth. All Steppe Spirits possess the Ways of the Steppe Virtue and some have the ability to Grant Major Supernatural Virtues to their chosen messengers.

At its settled fringes, where the Great Steppe has begun to fray under the advance of settled communities, the Great Tengri has engendered lesser spirits at the cost of some of its own power. These lesser spirits are considered genii loci of a particular region, stretches of grassland that can range in size from a small valley, to the size of a large European kingdom. Three possible fates await such lesser fragment spirits.

*Survival:* The genius locus of the local steppe is strong enough to hold its own against the encroachment of the mundanes and the Dominion. These spirits give rise to magical steppes, such as the southeast plains of Russia around the Sea of Azov, the Dzungarian depression, and the distant eastern plains of Mongolia. Between such peripheries, the Great Steppe spirit rules unchecked, only slightly diminished in power. Beyond these buffers, only lesser nature spirits and faeries are found.

*Dissolution:* The genius locus of the


steppe is too small to maintain its control over the steppe, or else it borders on more powerful areas that sap its strength until nothing remains. These spirits leave behind a mundane steppe. Examples include Pannonia, where the effects of the nearby Dominion of the Byzantine Empire have forced the lesser steppe spirits to flee into the deeper steppe. Likewise, the Hungarian plain, hemmed in by the arc of the Carpathians, where the formerly nomadic Magyars have settled, has also been sapped of its remaining strength, becoming an isolated promontory of Divine pasture.

*Replacement:* The genius locus has dwindled and been replaced by another supernatural being. This most commonly gives rise to a Faerie steppe at the edges of


## *Mythic Mongols Story Seeds*

#### **Dark Angels of Punishment**

The possibility of an Infernal Mongol horde may appeal to some troupes. Perhaps the nomad leader and his generals are the mortal incarnations of powerful Angels of Punishment, demons of the Order of Avengers of Evil posing as Divine retribution (*Realms of Power: The Infernal*, pages 39–40). The accompanying shamans may be Infernally-aligned human summoners or even fully-fledged diabolists, but the majority of the horde may still be composed of mundane nomads. Instead of an Angel of Punishment, Genghis Khan may be a startling incarnation of the new Zahhak, possessed by the ancient demonic foe of Persia, Azi Dahak (see Chapter 8: Mythic Persia).

For more high-fantasy Sagas with a strong Infernal theme, the horde may contain true demons of destruction and other Infernal creatures. This latter option is recommended only for high-powered troupes who are willing to explore a heavily Infernal-themed Saga.

#### **Spawn of Gog and Magog**

Another alternative is that the Mongol horde has ridden out of Arcadia, the latest incarnation of a recurring story that manifests the fears of nomad brutality and avarice held by the agrarian settlers along the steppe frontier since ancient times. From the biblical hordes of Gog and Magog, then Goths, then the Huns and the Avars, the recent Magyars, and now the Mongols, such cyclic dark Faerie incursions are repeated throughout the history of the region.

In this scenario, Genghis Khan may be the latest role played by a dark Faerie Monarch, with his generals and officials represented by the other powerful court faeries (see *Realms of Power: Faerie*, pages 80–83). The rank and file of the Mongol horde may contain variants of lesser Faerie Knights, Faerie-touched humans, and mundane human nomads. In a high-fantasy saga, the horse archers of the horde may be led by Faerie centaurs, or contain whole troops of such faeries rather than the mundane Mongol Trooper detailed earlier. The shamans and tributary magicians accompanying the horde would be represented by Faerie Wizards skilled in the Artes Fabulosa, or perhaps true Faeries with powers that can equal, and in some cases exceed, Hermetic magic.

#### **Prester John, I Presume?**

A more positive take on the Faerie horde may involve the nomads as the soldiers of Prester John, the Christian King of the East, born out of the legends of the Crusades. The exact source of the legend is unclear, but may relate to corrupted rumors of Sultan Sanjar's defeat in 1141 by the forces of the Qara Khitai at the Qatwan steppes near Samarkand. This far eastern confederation of nomad tribes contained several Nestorian Christian elements under the rule of a mysterious nomad dynasty. Regardless of the legend's origins, the story is popular throughout Mythic Europe, perhaps even popular enough to have drawn a troupe of powerful Faeries


settlement and pastoralists. The power of the original spirit is subsumed by a Faerie incarnation that feeds off the folktales told by the descendents of nomads. The towns along the Jaxartes border a Faerie steppe.

## *Mythic Mongols*

The exact nature of Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes is best left to individual troupes to determine, based on the needs of their saga and the resources available. The simplest approach is to treat the Mongols as mundane barbarians under a brilliantly talented mundane general and let history unfold as usual. Details for mundane Mongol troops are given earlier. Further details of the nomad horde's activities in the Mythic Middle East in the immediate canonical future are given in Chapter 2 of *Ancient Magic*, pages 15–18. The bibliography in the Appendix provides further reading and resources available on the web that may aid sagas with a strong Mongol

## *Steppe Spirit Story Seeds*

#### **The Ride of the Shaman**

Led by visions of an unending sea of grass beneath the clearest of blue skies, one of the characters wanders out into the steppe alone. After surviving a harrowing night of severe exposure on the Steppe, the character successfully achieves communion with the Steppe spirit and is ordained a shaman of the Great Tengri.

The Ordeal inflicts an effect similar to a premature gain in enough Aging Points (in any Characteristic) to achieve the next level in Decrepitude, automatically forcing a Crisis (see **ArM5**, pages 169–170), and the gain of enough Warping Points to raise his Warping score by 2.

In return, the character gains the equivalent of the Nightwalker Virtue, and the ability to enter *ekstasis* and generate a spirit body referred to as a *phantasticum* in return for the Pagan Flaw — the great spirit, while tolerant, demands its messengers respect its divinity (see *Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, pages 103–119, for examples of Nightwalker traditions capable of spirit traveling).

#### **The Founder's Final Work**

Aloof, distant, and uncaring, the Great Tengri would seem to present no current threat to the western based Order. Unlike the fractured remnants of the Hercynian Forest Spirit, Mercurian rituals have not weakened this primal magical force, and it is yet untouched by the settlement of the mundane and the miracles of the Dominion. Its lands are largely untamed, except at its fringes where the lesser steppe touches on urbanized cultures. Quiet and alien, it remains as powerful as ever, a vast reservoir of magical power waiting to be studied and unlocked by a Hermetic magus dedicated to completing the final work of Hercynius filius Bonisagus, the integration of Merinita's original nature magic into Hermetic theory.

## *Mythic Mongols Story Seeds (cont'd)*

styling themselves as the legions of the lost Christian monarch. Although posing as Divine agents, such creatures may best be presented as Faeries playing a pious role. They feed off the Vitality released by the powerful emotions created by the effect of their arrival on the Islamic Caliphate, and the consequences the news of its devastation has on the embattled Crusaders and the rest of Christian Europe.

#### **The Vengeance of God**

A final interpretation of the Mongols is as a Divine host of punishment, although this is the most difficult to realize within the historical framework. Reconciling the massacres of the Transoxanian towns may be problematic, but even within the Dominion, the manipulations of demons and the Infernal attempt to divert the righteous into temptation and sin. The Crusades of the Levant provide a precedent for the paradox of holy war. Of all the scenarios this may be the most challenging to Hermetic magi, as the power of the Divine is the only force that can trump the otherwise unassailable in-game position of the Order of Hermes as the most powerful magic in Mythic Europe. In a Divine horde saga, the Mongol shamans may be holy companions following a monotheistic vision of the Great Tengri. Their holy powers are duly feared by the sahirs and hedge magicians of the Mythic Middle East.

#### **The Lost Line of The Aquila**

The fate of the second apprentice of Hercynius is unknown. His name is conjecture, although most tales refer to him simply as The Aquila. Traveling eastwards in search of untouched wilderness, he was last seen entering the littoral steppes north of the Crimea in the late 11th century.

On the third day of the 1228 Tribunal, a strange apparition appears in the Durenmar council chamber. The spirit materializes next to the startled Praeco. Witnesses describe seeing a translucent man carrying a legionary standard, a large eagle, or a blurred summation of both forms. Philipus Niger's first attack appears to have little effect on the supposed spirit. The apparition merely looks around at the gathering, says nothing, and then quickly fades away. The covenant's Aegis appears intact. The elderly Archivist, Xavier of Mercere, claims to recognize the apparition, which he says resembles the long-lost magus.

Is the apparition The Aquila or merely a shamanic descendant spirit traveling by phantasticum? Is there now a Nightwalker tradition strong enough to challenge the Order of Hermes, somewhere out in the Mythic Steppe? Could the lineage of Hercynius have survived? Out of Hermetic contact for nearly two centuries, would the magic of The Aquila's descendants even be recognizable as Hermetic? Where would their allegiances lie — to the Order that abandoned them or to the encroaching nomads of the great grass sea? What ramifications for the Order would ensue if the secret of Parma Magica has been handed down and shared with the hedge magicians of the encroaching hordes?


story element.

More Mythic variants based loosely in historical fact include casting the Mongol leader and even his more famous generals as powerful Blood of Heroes Mythic Companions, as detailed in *Houses of Hermes: True Lineages,* pages 103–104*.* In this option, the Mongol leaders are scions of Ares (Mars) or perhaps Attila, the most famous nomad raider of the near past.

Alternatively, Genghis Khan himself may be invested as a Spirit Votary of the Great Tengri spirit of the Mythic Steppe, having bargained with the sky spirit on the slopes of the sacred Mongolian mountain of Burkhan Khaldun (see earlier for details on this Kosmokrator*-*level Magic Spirit). This version of Genghis Khan may be able to call upon elemental Magic powers staggering enough to require the fractured Order of Hermes to unite against his campaign or risk annihilation. Rules for Spirit Votaries are detailed in *Realms of Power: Magic,* pages 88–89.

#### **Magus-level Shamans?**

Troupes with access to *Hedge Magic Revised Edition* may wish to consider using magus-level shamans in their sagas, either as worthy non-Hermetic adversaries or perhaps even as potential recruits to the Order via House Criamon or Ex-Miscellanea. In either of the historically rooted scenarios detailed earlier, a powerful shaman might best be represented as Gifted Companion or Mythic Companion variants of Nightwalkers, able to travel by phantasticum (spirit-body), similar to the Magyar Taltos. Such Magic-aligned nomad magicians may have access to the Goetic Art of Summoning, the Major Virtue Mythic Herbalism and perhaps some minor powers (Flight, Healing, Premonitions, Skinchanger) commonly attributed to the Folk Witches found in other parts of Mythic Europe (see *Hedge Magic Revised Edition*, pages 33–54, for details of Folk Witches, and pages 103–119, for examples of Nightwalker traditions capable of spirit traveling).

## *Appendix A*

# *Languages and Names*

Given the immense area covered by this book, it is not surprising that a wide range of languages are spoken throughout the region, none of which are particularly related to one another. Each consists of several distinct regional dialects, which are given in parentheses; most characters should take the appropriate one as a specialty. Educated or well-traveled speakers will have tried hard to rid themselves of their dialect, and may have standard specialties (see **ArM5**, page 66). When two characters converse in different dialects of the same language they must both subtract one from their Language Ability scores.

**Arabic** (Egyptian, Khaliji, Levantine, Maghrebi, Maslawi) **Oghuz** (Azerbaijani, Ghuzz, Turkish) **Parsi** (Bactrian, Baloch, Kurdish, Luri, Pashto, Persian, Sogdian, Tabari) **Avestan (a** dead Language)

Arabic is the most important of these, as the language of the *Qur'an* and of religion, of scholarship, and of the administration in most of the Muslim world, as well as the language most commonly spoken in the western Middle East. The Khaliji dialect is spoken principally in Arabia, whereas the Maslawi dialect is spoken in Iraq and Jibal. The Maghrebi dialect is spoken throughout North Africa. The Arabic language uses the Arabic script.

Parsi is also widely used, especially in the eastern regions, with Persian (Parsik) as its "court" dialect, and various distinct dialects for Kirman and Makran (Baloch), Mazandaran (Tabari), Khuzistan (Luri), Jibal (Kurdish), and Ghur (Pashto). The Sogdian dialect is spoken in most of Transoxiana and Khwarazm, except for Bactria, where they have their own dialect. Parsi uses an extension of the Arabic script to permit Persian sounds such as "p" and "ch," although ancient texts use the Pahlavi script. Sogdian uses its own Sogdian alphabet. Avestan is the liturgical language of Zoroastrianism, and uses either the older Pahlavi or the more recent Avestan script.

Throughout the Muslim world, variants of Oghuz are also spoken by many members of the nobility. Turkish is the dialect most commonly heard in Seljukinfluenced areas, although the Azerbaijani and Ghuzz dialects of Oghuz are sufficiently different from the Turkish dialect to cause some difficulties in understanding. Historically, Oghuz was transliterated in Turkic "runes," but only the Ghuzz retain this tradition; Turkish is written using the Arabic script.

Other languages that characters may encounter include Hebrew (among Jews), Latin and Greek (especially among scholars), Mongolian, Aramaic (among some Christians of the Jazira and northwest provinces), Ge'ez (among Ethiopian Christians), Georgian, and Armenian. One language that is written and used liturgically but not commonly spoken is Syriac, used by Nestorian and Jacobite Christians.

# *Muslim Names*

Traditional Muslim names consist of some or all of a number of elements:

**Ism:** The name given at birth. This may be an Arabic name, the Qur'anic form of a biblical name, a compound name consisting of "Abd" (servant of) plus one of the names of God (among men; women might use "Amat" in place of "Abd," but this is much less common), or a non-Arabic name.

**Nasab:** Pedigree. The nasab in Arabic consists of "ibn" (son of) or "bint" (daughter of), followed by either the father's *ism* or a family *ism*.

**Kunya:** This is the term "abu" (father of) or "umm" (mother of), prefixed to either the name of a child or an attribute, acquired either upon becoming a parent or as an epithet. This may appear before the ism or after the nasab.

**Laqab:** An honorific or descriptive title, or occasionally a nickname, often held by nobility, religious notables or other important figures. Many laqabs consist of a compound term ending in "al-Din" (of the faith) or "al-Dawla" (of the state), while another common form is to start with "al-Malik" (the king), followed by a descriptive term. Individuals may have more than one laqab.

**Nisba:** A broad term denoting profession, place of origin or birth, or tribe or family. It can also be a descriptive element. Nisbas often begin with the definite article "al-" and end in "i," in the case of men, or "iyya," in the case of women. An individual may have several nisbas.

As an example, the full name of Saladin is: Al-Malik al-Nasir Salah al-Din Abu'l-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub ibn Shadhi al-Kurdi. This breaks down into:

**Name:** Al-Malik al-Nasir **Meaning:** The King who Aids

**Element:** *laqab*


**Name:** Salah al-Din **Meaning:** Righteousness of the Faith

**Element:** *laqab*

**Name:** Abu'l-Muzaffar

**Meaning:** Father of al-Muzaffar

**Element:** *kunya*

**Name:** Yusuf **Meaning:** Joseph **Element:** *ism*

**Name:** ibn Ayyub **Meaning:** Son of Job **Element:** *nasab*

**Name:** ibn Shadhi **Meaning:** Son of Shadhi

**Element:** *nasab*

**Name:** al-Kurdi **Meaning:** The Kurd **Element:** *nisba*

# *Persian Names*

Muslim name structures are used by Persians, with a few differences. Traditional Persian isms tend replace the Arabic components. The nasab is indicated with either "i" rather than "ibn," or else using the suffixes "-pur" or "-zade." Laqabs and nisbas tend to follow the Muslim model, although often use their Parsi equivalents.

# *Seljuk Names*

The Seljuks have adopted Muslim names, by and large, although traditional Turkic isms are used. Either "-oghlu" or " zade" is suffixed to the father's or family name to form the nasab. Sometimes several forbears are given.

From Dunwich to Innsmouth, from the halls of Miskatonic University to the Charles Dexter Ward at Arkham Sanitarium, trouble is in the air. The stars are almost right, and terrors from beyond space and time are starting break through. When Cthulhu rises, we're all doomed ... but whose downfall will be the most entertaining?

In Cthulhu Gloom, you guide your Lovecraftian characters down a path of horror and madness to an untimely death, while keeping your opponents happy, healthy, and annoyingly alive. While your characters Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll

encourage your opponents to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points.

When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins.

Cthulhu Gloom is printed on transparent plastic cards, so elements on previously played cards show through those above them. You can immediately see the point value of every character, no matter how many cards are piled on.

Cthulhu Gloom is a stand-alone card game, that's also compatible with Gloom and its expansions. It introduces Transformation cards that replace a character's art with something hideous and slimy; when you've Felt Rather Fishy, the squamous results aren't easily forgotten!
